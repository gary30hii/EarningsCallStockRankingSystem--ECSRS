After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Chuck MacGlashing, Head of Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead.\nChuck MacGlashing: Good afternoon, and welcome to HubSpot\u2019s Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2020 Earnings Conference Call.

Now, it\u2019s my pleasure to turn over the call to HubSpot\u2019s CEO and Chairman, Brian Halligan.\nBrian Halligan: Thanks, Chuck. Good afternoon, folks. Thank you for joining us today to review HubSpot\u2019s fourth quarter and full year 2020 earnings results. I\u2019m exceptionally proud of how HubSpot team closed out the year. In Q4, we saw a nice reacceleration in revenue growth of 35% year-over-year. During the quarter, we surpassed 100,000 customers. And in December, we crossed $1 billion in ARR, two terrific milestones on which to end the year. So, what\u2019s behind this reacceleration in growth? Well, this unusual year opened up everyone\u2019s eyes to just how early we still are in the digital transformation of the economy. This is the trend we\u2019ve been seeing for 14 years and it was sped up for obvious reasons this year. New startups we work with, while they\u2019re born digital, older scaleups we work with who may have only been partially online in the past, have begun to fully digitize their end-to-end experience. HubSpot has the ideal platform to enable all these companies to build delightful modern experiences for their customers. Another trend we\u2019ve seen is a shift in the market\u2019s expectations for B2B software. People now expect it to work like the consumer software they use in their personal lives. Traditional enterprise CRMs are cobbled together through lots of acquisitions, and the resulting user experience, well, it\u2019s pretty rough. Our CRM, it\u2019s crafted internally with a consumer-like UI matched with a scalable enterprise back end. This approach is resonating very well in the marketplace. All of our products in all of our geographies performed well in Q4. In particular, we saw strong growth in our enterprise tier. This year, we did launches of our Marketing Hub Enterprise product, our CMS Hub Enterprise product and our Sales Hub and Enterprise products. These all did well individually in the market. But, the thing that really stood out was the number of companies buying two or more of our hubs, taking advantage of having their entire go-to-market on one platform with one data model, one representation of their customer and one user interface. We\u2019re super pleased that our unique approach was recognized just the other day when HubSpot was named the number 2 Best Global Software Seller according to user reviews on G2 Crowd. We were wedged right between Microsoft and Zoom. So, much has changed about the relationship between companies and their customers this year, and so much opportunity still lies ahead. After a strong finish to the year, the team is more motivated than ever to help our customers create remarkable end-to-end customer experiences and grow better in 2021. With that, I\u2019ll hand it over to Kate.\nKate Bueker: Thanks, Brian. Let\u2019s turn to our fourth quarter and full year financial results, and our guidance for the first quarter and full year of 2021. Fourth quarter revenue growth reaccelerated to 32% year-over-year in constant currency and 35% as reported. Q4 subscription revenue grew 36% year-over-year, while services revenue increased 9% year-over-year on an as-reported basis. Full year 2020 revenue grew 30% in constant currency and 31% as reported. Full year subscription revenue grew 32%, while services revenue grew 5%, again both as reported. We saw strong demand across all of our hubs in Q4, resulting in a reacceleration in new business growth, along with record customer dollar and net revenue retention rates. In Q4, we added 8,400 net customers, ending 2020 with nearly 104,000 total customers, up 42% year-over-year. Average subscription revenue per customer of nearly $9,800 was up slightly sequentially but down a few points year-over-year. Domestic revenue grew 27% in Q4, while international revenue growth was 40% year-over-year in constant currency and 47% as reported. International revenue represented 44% of total revenue in Q4, up 3 points year-over-year. Deferred revenue as of the end of December was $317 million, a 35% increase year-over-year. Calculated billings were $309 million in Q4, growing 38% year-over-year in constant currency and 43% as reported. This reacceleration in constant currency billings growth was driven by strong revenue performance and a positive mix shift toward Professional and Enterprise subscriptions in the quarter. The remainder of my comments will refer to non-GAAP measures. Fourth quarter and full year gross margins were 82% flat year-over-year. Subscription gross margin was 85%, while services gross margin was negative 20%. Fourth quarter operating margin was 10%, up slightly compared to the same period a year ago, as a result of our strong revenue performance in the quarter. Full year operating margin was 8%, flat year-over-year. We invested aggressively in our business over the last year to meet the significant demand for our products and drive innovation to fuel long-term growth. We plan to continue this investment approach in 2021. At the end of the fourth quarter, we had 4,225 employees, up 25% year-over-year. Net income in the fourth quarter was $20 million or $0.40 per diluted share. Net income for the full year was $64 million or $1.32 per diluted share. CapEx, including capitalized software development costs, was $15 million or 6% of revenue for the fourth quarter and $59 million or 7% of revenue for the full year. Free cash flow in the fourth quarter was $46 million or 18% of revenue, and $79 million or 9% of revenue for the full year. Finally, our cash and marketable securities totaled $1.3 billion at the end of December. And with that, let\u2019s dive into guidance for the first quarter and full year of 2021. For the first quarter, total revenue is expected to be in the range of $260 million to $265 million, up 32% year-over-year at the midpoint. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be between $17 million and $19 million. Non-GAAP diluted net income per share is expected to be between $0.28 and $0.30. This assumes 50.3 million fully diluted shares outstanding. And for the full year of 2021, total revenue is expected to be in the range of $1.16 billion to $1.17 billion, up 32% year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be between $98 million and $102 million. Non-GAAP diluted net income per share is expected to be between $1.51 and $1.59. This assumes 50.7 million fully diluted shares outstanding. As you adjust your models, keep in mind the following. At current spot rates, we\u2019re forecasting an FX tailwind to as-reported revenue of 4 points in Q1 and 3 points for the full year. As many of you are aware, we will have some unusual year-over-year growth comparisons in 2021. With that in mind, I thought it would be helpful to provide some additional color on how we\u2019re thinking about cadence of growth throughout 2021. We anticipate revenue growth of 35% in the first half of the year, followed by revenue growth of 30% in the second half of the year as comparisons become more difficult. Our 2021 guidance assumes flat operating margin year-over-year. Embedded in that guidance, we have assumed a healthy level of investment across the business to meet the market demand we\u2019re seeing, more normal levels of T&E expense in the back half of the year and continued strong investment in R&D. Lastly, we expect CapEx as a percentage of revenue to be about 5% in 2021 and free cash flow to be about $130 million, with seasonally stronger free cash flow in Q1 and Q4. And with that, I\u2019ll hand the call back over to Brian for his closing comments.\nBrian Halligan: Thanks, Kate. Those numbers reflect how nicely our customer flywheel is spinning. Well, our employee flywheel is spinning nicely, too. We were just recognized as the Fourth Best Place to Work in 2021 by Glassdoor. Last month, Comparably also highlighted HubSpot as being the number 1 Best Workplace for Women and a Top Place to Work for Parents. We endeavored not just to talk the talk on diversity inclusion but walk the walk. We have a variety of initiatives underway, but two new ones I\u2019m particularly proud of our $20 million commitment to social impact investing in a new partnership with Howard University, which established a new Center for Digital Business on their campus. The difficult years are always the ones that define you, and I\u2019m grateful to every HubSpotter and our partner community for the way we all pulled together to end the year strong and start 2021 with momentum. I\u2019m super grateful to the 100,000 customers who put their trust in us. Thank you for your time. Operator, let\u2019s open up the call for a few questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Mark Murphy from JP Morgan.\nMark Murphy: Thank you. And congrats on a great finish to the year. So, Brian, I have noticed what you pointed out that G2 Crowd had ranked Microsoft, HubSpot and Zoom as the top three software companies for 2021. I thought that was pretty amazing. I\u2019m wondering when we see that kind of prioritization that you\u2019re getting, should we assume that marketing budgets are going to shift pretty quickly to digital and to inbound this year. Is that embedded in your assumption, or do you see those signs, or is it more to do with the surge you\u2019ve had in the starter cohorts? And maybe we\u2019re going to see that converting this year?\nBrian Halligan: Hey Mark, thanks for your question. I was super pleased to see that sort of sandwiched between two terrific software companies, Zoom and Microsoft. And I think it\u2019s just a reflection of a lot of the bets we\u2019ve made over the last couple of years. Products just gotten way better, our customers are way happier, and they\u2019ve given us really good reviews there on G2. So, really happy about it. In terms of kind of the second part of your question, I mean, things are good. I mean, we\u2019re seeing nice momentum kind of across all three tiers of the product, the Enterprise, the Pro and the Starter, and across kind of all the geographies. So, feeling good. Things are going well. Thanks for your question.\nMark Murphy: And I had a quick follow-up for Kate. I was just wondering if you see much of a structural change for your real estate costs and your T&E levels in the post-pandemic world. I think, you said in the second half that T&E will normalize a bit. But, if you have more people working a bit more remotely, is it possible that there\u2019s an extra point or 2 of margin coming out the other side of this, or do you kind of prefer to reinvest that?\nKate Bueker: I think, the theme that you will hear over and over from us is that we believe there\u2019s a ton of opportunity ahead and that we\u2019re going to continue to reinvest in the business. And so, that\u2019s the comment that I would make generally. We are, as you pointed out, assuming that we are largely remote, at least for the first half of the year. There are some modest assumptions that we get back to travel at some point over the course of 2021. But, it doesn\u2019t have a dramatic impact on our operating margins for the year.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Samad Samana from Jefferies.\nSamad Samana: Congrats on this very strong finish to the year. Kate, maybe one for you and then one for Brian. But first, Brian mentioned crossing a $1 billion ARR mark. And that implies a pretty significant acceleration I think in back half bookings, especially in the fourth quarter. Can you help us maybe understand how net retention looked and how that impacted it versus new customer bookings?\nKate Bueker: Yes. I think the good news is that we had great things to say about both of those pieces. In terms of retention, I obviously shared in the prepared remarks that we had a record quarter for retention and it\u2019s -- what I like about that is, actually, there is just a lot of components that are all complementary in driving the retention in a positive direction. It starts with the fact that we are -- we had record customer dollar retention. And then, our upgrade rates are also hitting new and record levels. In particular, we\u2019re seeing some strength in that addition upgrade motion.\nBrian Halligan: Yes. I\u2019ll just add to that, like some of the investments we made are really paying off in -- it\u2019s a leading indicator but NP -- our Net Promoter Score is something we\u2019ve been obsessed about for a couple of years. In this past year, it went way up, like the investments we made are really paying off. And then, graduation rates. Typically, it\u2019s like a 300-person company that has been with us since they were 30 and they\u2019re 3,000. [Ph] A lot of times you graduate there. I just think the power we\u2019ve added to the platform is really paying off, and people are sticking around longer and enjoying the new sophisticated [indiscernible].\nSamad Samana: Brian, so that brings me to a good follow-up question. And the one that I had for you was, crossing the $1 billion market is obviously incredibly impressive. But, as you think looking forward to going from 1 to 2 and the flywheel that you have today, are there any changes we should anticipate or that you think that need to be made, or is it -- as it\u2019s currently constructive, can it get you -- can start to kind of get you to that $1.52 billion level, just as we think about investments in \u201821 positioning you for that?\nBrian Halligan: Well, when I think of HubSpot, Samad, it\u2019s like the bottom of the second inning in our baseball game. It still feels early. There is a giant market out there for CRM. We\u2019re kind of mid-transition from moving as a company from being a marketing app to try and become the number 1 CRM for scaling companies. So, you\u2019re going to see us continue to improve the product, improve the go-to-market, improve the way we execute. We are sort of tireless in our desire to get better and to deliver more value to our customers. So, continue -- it\u2019s not -- this isn\u2019t a steady state kind of company, a lot more investment coming, a lot more innovation, more products, existing products getting better. It still feels early in my head, my friend.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Stan Zlotsky from Morgan Stanley.\nStan Zlotsky: Thank you so much. And congratulations also on a very, very strong end to 2020. Maybe just a couple of questions from my end. On the macro, right, what are you guys seeing across the world? And, how are you baking that into the growth acceleration that you provided for 2021 on the top line?\nBrian Halligan: Do you want me to take that? Do you want to take that, Kate?\nKate Bueker: You want to start, and then I can talk about how we included that in guidance?\nBrian Halligan: Sure. I\u2019ll just sort of reiterate what I kind of talked about earlier, Stan, where there\u2019s a couple of drivers going on here. I mean, COVID just sort of accelerated people\u2019s digitization moves. Like, I think everybody knew they need to completely digitize their go-to-market, and this just sort of accelerated it. And so, the demand has been strong. I don\u2019t see that demand going back. I feel like people are going to lean into the future going forward. So, the demand\u2019s strong. Our target market -- so the whole market is growing, and then our target market is also expanding. If you think about it, like we\u2019re moving from a marketing app to a CRM platform. That CRM market is much bigger than the marketing app market. And we\u2019re doing -- we\u2019re starting to do really well and make a lot of progress on there. And so, the market is large and growing. And so, we\u2019re just kind of really well positioned to lean into it. I also would just say, Stan, like our competitive positioning is super unique and super compelling for prospects and customers. So, our win rates are going up and our retention rates are going up. Like, things are really good. Some of those bets we\u2019ve been making over the last couple of years we\u2019ve been talking about, they\u2019re really starting to pay off for us over the last year.\nStan Zlotsky: And now, just a quick follow-up. The Starter package promotion, which was a very smart, strategic decision to make through the year and the promotional pricing there, how are you guys thinking about that as you get into 2021 and some of those -- the promotional pricing is going to start rolling off? What kind of retention and conversion rates are you guys thinking about?\nKate Bueker: Yes. Thanks for the question. We obviously are paying a ton of attention. I would say, just like stepping back on that one, we -- what we tried to do in making the changes on the pricing and packaging side there was to just simplify things. And by bringing it together as a suite, putting forward like a $50 price point, it just really simplifies the buying process at the low end. And the learning that we have there is that it was really -- making it easy is super compelling. And so, we think that was a great choice to make. We have been watching the upgrade rates closely. We have been watching the usage rates closely, and we\u2019re feeling good about both of those metrics. So, overall, we\u2019re feeling great about that Starter Growth Suite play. We do have operational plans underway to try to maximize success on the renewal of those big cohorts. And so, we will continue to share that as appropriate.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Terry Tillman from Truist Securities.\nNick Negulic: Hey. It\u2019s actually Nick on for Terry. Thanks for taking our question. I just wanted to touch on international a little bit. So, it seems like international revenue growth has actually came to outpace domestic growth in recent quarters. I was just wondering if you guys could talk about how you\u2019re investing in that area to continue to drive strong growth. Then, where international could potentially move to as a percentage of revenue longer term? Thanks.\nBrian Halligan: Sure. This is Brian, Nick. I can take that. Really happy with -- frankly, we\u2019re really happy with both, the international growth and the domestic growth. Domestic growth really picked up nicely. I think, it\u2019s just a testament to -- the market is quite big, and I think it\u2019s growing. Now, when you look at the market versus -- U.S. versus international, really, all our segments are doing well. Like, across the geography, small business, the mid-market and the enterprise segment are doing well. And then, both our channels seem to be doing well, our direct channel and our indirect channel. Our partner channel seems to be doing well. I think, it\u2019s just a reflection that the product\u2019s gotten better, the value prop is getting better, our flywheel\u2019s spinning really nicely. Maybe Kate\u2019s got something to add to that.\nKate Bueker: Yes. I think that as we look at international, it has consistently been stepping up as a larger share of the overall revenue of the Company. And we would expect that that would continue over the next few years.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Arjun Bhatia from William Blair.\nArjun Bhatia: I\u2019ll add my congrats on a strong quarter. Brian, maybe one for you. You\u2019ve touched on kind of this evolution from an app to a platform. I\u2019d just love to hear what you\u2019re seeing from your new customers in terms of product adoption? Are you seeing them actually buy the whole platform upfront, meaning the Growth Suite, get all through solutions regardless of the addition that they\u2019re starting on? Do you see more platform adoption from these new customers that are coming on board?\nBrian Halligan: Yes. Arjun, great question. The transition has gone real well. When I think about HubSpot, I can\u2019t help but think about the Clive Bell [ph] rule. I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019re familiar with that. But like, if you have one Clive Bell that can pull 1,000 pounds. And then you add a second Clive Bell that can pull 1,000 pounds, the really interesting thing that happens is that combined Clive Bell can pull 4,000 pounds of stuff. That\u2019s HubSpot. We have our Marketing Hub, we have our Sales Hub, our Service Hub, our CMS Hub. They\u2019re all built on this set of shared services underneath. The UI is the same. It\u2019s a single data model. It\u2019s a beautiful consumer-like front end and a powerful enterprise back end. And so, we\u2019re seeing nice adoption of that, a nice pickup from new customers who are buying full suite, particularly the Starter suite, and lots of existing customers from our Marketing Hub or Sales Hub buying other hubs. So, getting really good traction, particularly with new customers, but also the installed base.\nArjun Bhatia: And one follow-up, if I can, for Kate. I think, you mentioned really high record net retention rates. As we look forward, I think, this has fluctuated in the past. Do you get the fact that we\u2019re in a place now with the expansion motion that this can consistently stay above 100%, or should we expect a little bit more fluctuation there going forward?\nKate Bueker: Yes. I mean, that\u2019s a question we spend a lot of time talking about internally as well. I think, you just kind of turned clock back a little bit. At the time of the IPO, we had sort of a net retention in the mid-90s. Over the last couple of years, that has stepped up, and we\u2019ve been saying in and around 100. Look, we\u2019re -- we\u2019ve reached a new gear here in the last couple of quarters, and we\u2019re not calling a new normal, but the performance over the last couple of quarters certainly gives me a lot of confidence that we\u2019ll be able to keep retention at or above 100.\nOperator: Your next question comes from DJ Hynes from Canaccord Genuity.\nDJ Hynes: Thanks. Congrats on all the accolades and momentum, really impressive stuff here. Brian, I got a product question for you. So, if you think about HubSpot in the context of a CDP, right, collecting the data across the various customer touch points, my sense is that you guys are really good at aggregating the data that happens inside of HubSpot. Where are you in terms of pulling in data that\u2019s generated in other systems? Is that something that customers ask for? Is it important to the growth of the platform? Any color there would be helpful.\nBrian Halligan: Excellent question, DJ. Excellent question. I do think of HubSpot as a CDP where we do a fantastic job of collecting all kinds of data about all the touch points you have with your prospects and customers, whether that\u2019s visits to your website or they fill out a form or they\u2019re chatting with you in the website or they have a call with your sales rep, whether they don\u2019t fill on a ticket, whatever it would be, and then we combine them together and have this one unified view of the customer, that makes it incredibly valuable for the whole organization. Where you\u2019ll see us go over time, it\u2019s getting better and better, not just us collecting that data that it is managed by HubSpot, but with all of your front office applications and pulling all that together and making sense for our prospects with it. So, that\u2019s an area we\u2019re investing in. Super excited about our customers who want it. And keep your eyes on that channel.\nDJ Hynes: Okay, awesome. And then, one follow-up for Kate, if I can. So really, really strong net adds the last few quarters, but I think equally impressive is that ARPC has been going up sequentially, right? So, do you think we\u2019ve seen a bottom in that metric? And, is it possible that we see subscription revenue per customer actually grow in 2021?\nKate Bueker: Yes. You\u2019re -- again, we\u2019re hitting it on all the really hard ones here. Yes, we were obviously very excited about the incremental net adds in Q4. I think, the thing that I liked about it, which seems like we\u2019re aligned on, is that the customer growth was very balanced across the Starter and the Professional, Enterprise. And so, it translated also into a quarter-over-quarter increase in ASRPC. Honestly, you\u2019re going to see some quarters where you have less customer adds, and they\u2019re going to be at the high end, and you\u2019re going to see bigger increases in ASRPC. You\u2019re going to see other quarters where you have a concentration of the customer additions at the low end and a little bit more pressure in ASRPC. The good news is that when we look at the Starter and we look at Professional and Enterprise, each of those is expanding. And so, we feel good.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Brian Peterson from Raymond James.\nBrian Peterson: I\u2019ll echo my congratulations. So, Brian, maybe just one for you. If I think specifically about Sales Hub, in some of my partner conversations, I\u2019ve heard that the ability to kind of work with larger and larger teams is something that\u2019s kind of a common theme. What are some of your largest deployments for Sales Hub? And, how large do you think they can ultimately be over the next 3 to 5 years?\nBrian Halligan: Brian, thanks for the question. Sales Hub has a ton of potential. We rereleased Sales Hub Enterprise at INBOUND last year, and we\u2019ve had very strong demand for it over the last few months. And we have a whole bunch of good stuff keyed up for Sales Hub Enterprise this year and next. So, that product is going to get very, very legit. Very, very bullish on the future of that product. In terms of the size, we\u2019re definitely closing bigger deals. We closed a couple of offers in Q4 with many hundreds of seats. So, I think -- and we just see a lot more deals in our pipeline with larger seat volumes. So, it\u2019s -- the strategy and the investments are starting to pay off there on Sales Hub where the deal sizes are getting big. One of the things we\u2019ve just been working on, like, if I think of HubSpot, I step back and think about it, we\u2019re really strong in that -- in the very middle of the market, like 20 to 200 employees. And I give it like an A plus on our product market fit, our go-to-market market fit there. Where we\u2019re working hard on is that 200 to 2,000, what we call the enterprise, and then the 2 to 20. Lots of investments going in last year and this year in those areas, and we think we\u2019re going to make a lot of progress there.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Michael Turrin from Wells Fargo Securities.\nMichael Turrin: Look, the initial guide on top-line for the upcoming year really stands out. You\u2019ve laid out a bunch of reasons for it, but anything else you can add? If I\u2019m looking at this right, you have initially guided to 30-plus-percent revenue growth in four years now. So, anything you\u2019d call out that\u2019s just structurally different, heading into this year versus prior years?\nBrian Halligan: I hear Jeff Bezos talk about this. But, like in a given quarter, the stuff that\u2019s happening now, stuff that best we\u2019ve made really over the last couple of years. So like what happens this month doesn\u2019t really impact Q1 that much. So I\u2019m not shocked that we\u2019re seeing such good results and we have such good guidance and we\u2019ve reaccelerated. Like, we\u2019ve made some -- in a couple of cases, we\u2019re really done like the two steps back so we could take four steps forward. And we\u2019re just getting the return on some of those bets. And then, our market is bigger. We moved from a marketing app market, which is the gold market and not small and growing, to your whole darn front office. The CRM market is much, much bigger, and it\u2019s just a lot -- everyone needs one. It\u2019s not an optional thing. And whether you\u2019re a start-up buying your first one or you\u2019re a scale-up and you\u2019re not happy with what you\u2019ve got, we\u2019re just a great fit these days, and we\u2019ve become a better fit over the last couple of years. Our competitive advantages have increased. It\u2019s a little bit boring and a little old school. But, our value proposition has just gotten better. We win more deals and we retain customers longer, and we delight our customers. It\u2019s a little bit of very old fashioned, but it works.\nMichael Turrin: Long-term vision is neither boring, nor old fashion. It\u2019s refreshing to hear. I mean, the other question we\u2019ve just been getting a lot is around new customer trends and how to think about the sustainability of these elevated levels. Has the Starter Growth Suite unlocked something new you feel you can continue to tap into here, or anything else you can provide just to help us think through comparing the net adds you\u2019ve seen this year versus prior historical periods?\nKate Bueker: Yes. I mean, it definitely feels like we\u2019ve sort of hit a new level. You\u2019ve seen now three quarters where you have broken away from that, what we had been at that, call it, 3,000, 4,000 customer adds per quarter. And we feel good about our ability to continue to operate at that new level. Now, that doesn\u2019t mean that I would translate it in to 8,000 to 9,000 a quarter. I do think, as I was talking about a little bit earlier, there\u2019ll be some variability from one quarter to the next, based on whether we\u2019re seeing some strength at the low end or strength at the high end.\nMichael Turrin: Thank you. Congrats on the results here. It\u2019s truly impressive.\nBrian Halligan: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Drew Foster from Citi.\nDrew Foster: Brian, you\u2019ve been talking a lot about the growth and evolution of your portfolio to more of a front-office platform. And I\u2019m just curious what you\u2019re seeing as sort of the biggest changes in that market more broadly in the context of how that changes your view of different areas that look like attractive adjacencies for your portfolio.\nBrian Halligan: Yes. That\u2019s a good question. If I sort of back up and think about it like -- I\u2019ve been in this world of CRM since -- literally since 1990 when I graduated college. And many times over my career, I was in the position of either buying and implementing or using a CRM. And there\u2019s the tried-and-true playbook for how you do this, and it\u2019s been around for a long time, where someone built an SFA application. And then, they buy a whole bunch of stuff and cobble together this giant frank in CRM. And we\u2019re seeing there\u2019s several of them in the market today. And it\u2019s a good way to build a business. We decided to kind of zag when everyone else was zigging on that playbook. And we decided instead of cobbling this thing together, let\u2019s crack it, sort of Apple style and make it a beautiful application. Our development team, our product designers, our user research people are really good. The tools that we use and the platform we use internally is so powerful. And so, we\u2019ve decided to build it. And we think it\u2019s unique and differentiated and it really matters to the end users and the ops people to implement this stuff. Now, given that, underneath HubSpot, we have this set of shared services, and we\u2019ve exposed them through four hubs today. But we aren\u2019t done. It\u2019s still pretty early innings for HubSpot. There\u2019s a lot more stuff in our heads and on our drawing boards, where we can -- that we can expose through additional hubs down the road. I\u2019m not going to show my hand at when those hubs are coming and what they are, but we\u2019re not done. There\u2019s more opportunity out there for HubSpot, still early innings.\nDrew Foster: Got it. Okay. And now that your newer hubs have been out in the wild for a few quarters, especially some of your Enterprise releases, just wondering if you could give some anecdotes about sort of the role they\u2019re playing as new front doors to your business as you\u2019ve talked about in the past, whether you\u2019re attracting new types of customers. Just given how strong that customer number is the last couple of quarters here, just any color would be helpful. Thank you.\nBrian Halligan: Yes. Thanks for the question, Drew. I kind of think of HubSpot as we have Marketing Hub, which is the OG hub, going really well, growing fast at scale, big market. We\u2019re going to continue to grow. And you got Sales Hub, good-sized business now. Wow, is it growing fast, lots of opportunity there. And then, you got CMS Hub and the Service Hub. Those hubs to me look a lot like the Sales Hub looked two, three years into that evolution. And so, hopefully, three years from now, we have Marketing Hub and Sales Hub both at scale and then these two hubs are cranking or big businesses. And then, there\u2019s new hubs kind of coming along. So, it\u2019s sort of like Horizon theory. Horizon theories 1, Horizon 1 bets Horizon 2 bets Horizon 3 bets. We have sort of bets along those horizons and the maturing and new bets that will come on line. The new hubs are doing well. CMS Hub and Service Hub doing well. Remind me a lot of Sales Hub. I think, they\u2019ll be big businesses. The combination -- the Clive Bell combination of these things is going to be really, really powerful over time.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Christopher Merwin from Goldman Sachs.\nChristopher Merwin: I wanted to ask about the service space. We\u2019re hearing more and more about messaging and chat bots being central and engaging with current and prospective customers. So, can you talk a bit about what you\u2019re doing in that area and how you\u2019re capturing that data and helping reps close more deals?\nBrian Halligan: Yes. It\u2019s -- we\u2019re super interested, and we\u2019re investing heavily in that. If you take a step back, you think about most of the communication that happens with ASIC or e-mail. And then, just increasingly, people want to do synchronous messaging types of communication, and that comes to likely lots and lots of different ways these days, lots of way to message. The one you\u2019re talking about sort of chat on the website and building box that automates that chat, that\u2019s an area we\u2019ve invested a lot in. And we have a great offering in the market today that our customers are buying. It works on your website if you\u2019ve got an app, it\u2019ll work inside your app. All of that gets pulled into a central place, and people can respond to those in real-time. That\u2019s an area we\u2019re super excited about. That\u2019s an area of growth for HubSpot. That\u2019s an area where human behavior is changing. And I think HubSpot is quite good at staying on top of these changes in helping people deal with them. So, it\u2019s a great question. We\u2019re really excited about that space.\nChristopher Merwin: And maybe just a quick follow-up. Obviously, I think you talked about it a little bit before, but accelerating growth next year. Not going to see that pass through to margin, but you\u2019re investing a lot in the long term here. I mean, is it possible to get a bit more granular on some of those key areas, specifically within go-to-market and R&D? Thanks.\nBrian Halligan: Sure. We\u2019ve been investing relatively heavily in R&D over the last several years, and we\u2019re going to continue to do it. We feel like we\u2019re getting nice returns on it, showing up in a retention rate, net promoter score revenue growth like -- the leading indicators look good. The lagging indicators look good, too. So, we\u2019re going to keep investing there. We\u2019re going to invest in our existing products. So, you saw we have a playbook where we can go into an existing product, hub and kind of relaunch it, really go after it again. And that works really well for us. And then, we\u2019ll build some new hubs and new capabilities. Our R&D team is kind of on fire these days. So, we\u2019re going to see results from those folks. Kate, do you want to add anything to that?\nKate Bueker: No, I think on the go-to-market side, we continue to invest to be able to service the demand that we\u2019re seeing in the market. And we talked about the fact that we\u2019re investing where we feel like we have this A, on the go-to-market and product in the middle and that we\u2019re investing both upmarket and also in tech touch at the low end.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Ken Wong from Guggenheim Partners.\nKen Wong: Brian, you mentioned earlier, CMS and Service looks like we\u2019re 2, 3 years into what you saw with Sales. As we think about the kind of the maturity of those products, is it just a matter of time you think before we get to a run rate like Sales, or is there some incremental watering, seeding, loving that you guys have to give to Service Hub from a product go-to-market perspective before we maybe see those kind of results?\nBrian Halligan: No. Lots of watering, lots of fertilizing, lots of work left to do. Let\u2019s just pick out Service Hub. The product is terrific, let\u2019s say, if you\u2019re a 50, 75-person company, if you\u2019re a 500 or 750-person company, there\u2019s some stuff that\u2019s still missing. And it kind of reminds me of Sales Hub a couple of years ago. If you\u2019re a 500, 750- person company, like you\u2019re closed guys, but there\u2019s a subtle gap. It\u2019s very, very similar. We know what the gaps are. And in our own way, leveraging the primary collars, we\u2019re filling those gaps. There\u2019s plenty of water, plenty of fertilizers left to do. And I would say that also for the Marketing Hub product. Like, we\u2019ve had that product out there for 14.5 years. There\u2019s still plenty of low-hanging fruit at Marketing Hub product. It\u2019s a terrific product. But even this year, it\u2019s going to get a lot better. And so, yes, we don\u2019t see HubSpot as sort of the fix thing, like there\u2019s going to be a lot of innovation across new and existing hubs over time.\nKen Wong: And Kate, just on the margins. So, second year in a row that we\u2019ve had flat margins, and I fully recognize it\u2019s a fantastic time to step on the gas given what we\u2019re seeing. I guess, as we think going ahead, should we think that you guys are more focused on the growth side versus the margin side in terms of how we should kind of adjust our models?\nKate Bueker: Yes. I think, that the message that you should hear from us is that the priority is on continuing to invest in the business to drive long-term growth. That said, we have a framework. And over the long term, we will continue to follow that framework. But, in the near term, I think, you shouldn\u2019t expect a linear movement.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Michael Turits from KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nMichael Turits: So, a strong quarter, both on the net expansion of existing customers and it sounds like new customers came in at a high price level, too. Which was the bigger factor in both of those? What was it, was it the addition upsell and higher level of additions, or what was it more attached at multiple ops?\nKate Bueker: It\u2019s relatively balanced. We -- across those factors, there\u2019s a bunch of stuff that plays into it.\nBrian Halligan: Yes. I would just say new and cross-sell both performed well.\nMichael Turits: And then, Kate, you made -- the last quarter, you made a comment about billings in terms of duration that there was a duration headwind. This quarter, strong billings quarter, was there a duration tailwind in any sense this quarter?\nKate Bueker: Yes, there was. And I think as many people who listen to these calls would probably know, billings is not my favorite metric out there. There\u2019s just a lot of stuff that happens with billings that can confuse people. That said, on -- again, over the long term, constant currency revenue and constant currency billings are going to track one another. You see quarter-over-quarter some volatility there. By the way, I\u2019m getting like 7 packages delivered. So, I\u2019m [indiscernible] background here. I don\u2019t know how to shut it off. So last quarter, we did see constant currency billings above constant currency revenue. A few points of that is a result of the fact that we\u2019re getting some advantage from a duration extension. The Professional and Enterprise additions performed really well, and those tend to have longer billing terms than the lower-end Starter products. There was another small bit here that was helpful. Some of the customers that we had given short-term plays to in Q2 at the onset of the pandemic were coming off of those sort of discounts or flexible payment terms. And so, they billed again in Q4. It was a smaller factor. And then, the remaining performance of billings was really just strong bookings for the quarter.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Ryan MacDonald from Needham.\nAlex Henderson: This is Alex on for Ryan. Could you discuss the strategic rationale for the Hustle acquisition? Content creation and top-of-funnel lead generation has never really been an issue for the business, in my view. So, how does this enhance the business or Hubs possibility to acquire new logos?\nBrian Halligan: Great question. Alex, when we started HubSpot, it was on this idea of inbound marketing. And the problem with marketers is they\u2019re always renting space on someone else\u2019s assets, a radio show, a TV show, a newspaper, and increasingly more recently, a social network or a search engine. And the idea behind inbound marketing was instead of renting space in somebody else\u2019s assets, well, just create your own asset, increase the number of those assets and increase the return you\u2019re getting on those assets. What I love about the Hustle folks is they had some unbelievable assets. They had a newsletter asset. Very, very, very modern and news newsletter, those things are taking off. They have the best one in the business in our opinion. They have a fantastic podcast and very deep research. So, it\u2019s a little bit of an acquirer to get that terrific talent and all those assets that we plan to invest in and grow over time. So, we\u2019re super, super excited about the Hustle. We think it\u2019s going to be a fair advantage on the marketing side, for sure.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jennifer Lowe from UBS.\nJennifer Lowe: Brian, you\u2019ve made comments a couple of times about sort of the scaleup versus start-up component of your business. And in particular, given that a lot of those companies that may have been in market longer are now dealing with a selling environment that\u2019s very different than how they sold in the past. I\u2019m just curious if you\u2019re seeing any difference. And at the same time, you\u2019ve matured your own product with the Enterprise and Pro SKUs. Are you seeing a difference in how often you\u2019re replacing an existing technology that may not be meeting current needs as opposed to how frequently you\u2019re landing in an environment where there just really isn\u2019t preexisting technology?\nBrian Halligan: Yes. That\u2019s a terrific question, Jennifer. In a start-up, we\u2019re typically the first legit system they have in place, like the first legit CRM they\u2019ll put in place, which is where we want to be and then we want to scale with them. In a scaleup, oftentimes, someone have put in -- tried to put in a CRM, it just didn\u2019t go well. It\u2019s too hard to set up. It was too hard to use and too complicated. And they got it sort of partly set up, and then they just said that they can\u2019t see a better way to do this stuff. And they find HubSpot, and they implement us. And that\u2019s starting to happen more and more. We\u2019ve been talking about that for a while, but we\u2019re starting to see more of that in the market. I think, it\u2019s a testament to our approach. It\u2019s a patient person\u2019s approach to build all this stuff. But, I think that patience is paying off. I also think our go-to-market, Jennifer, really helps us in that area where, to engage with one of those traditional CRM players, into free trial. It\u2019s not premium. You got to deal with a whole bunch of sales reps to get anything done. And we\u2019ve got a super modern approach to the way people do it. And I think people like it. They want to use a free product and give it a run. They want to try it. They want a trial. And yes, they want talk to a sales rep, they engage and learn about it and pricing and packaging and negotiating and helping them get set up. But, I think our approach to letting people really use it matches the way they buy. I also think it really highlights our strength that it is easy to use and set up. It\u2019s very modern. And I think HubSpot is a little bit like Zoom. Zoom\u2019s not only a better product, but the go-to-market is much lighter. It\u2019s much easier to buy, like we want to be more like that. I think that\u2019s the future of that, it\u2019s more like that.\nJennifer Lowe: And then, just maybe a more specific one. It seems like relative to the headwinds that were happening in Q2 when everything went to shelter-in-place, you\u2019ve now largely kind of recovered of the business that was negatively impacted by that. Is that a fair assessment, or is there still more opportunity to improve the recapture rate of business that might have been impaired earlier in 2020?\nKate Bueker: We are largely through the impact of COVID plays.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Keith Bachman from Bank of Montreal.\nKeith Bachman: I\u2019ll ask two, if I could, and I\u2019ll just do it concurrently. One is, you talked about net adds, in particular, to follow on Michael Turits\u2019 question, I just want to hear some comments about this calendar year. Is there anything you want to call out? In particular, just trying to understand how you think mix for net adds may have an impact on the model? And the second question is, in the past, you talked a little bit about commerce could be an opportunity for our market. I just wanted to hear some thoughts -- any updated thoughts on commerce. In particular, what the opportunity might be for HubSpot in terms of your differentiated model? Thank you.\nBrian Halligan: You should take the first one. I\u2019ll take the second one, Kate.\nKate Bueker: Yes. Sure. In terms of new customer adds, I think, what you saw this year, 2020, was that the initial step-up that we saw in Q2 and then into Q3 was very much associated with the Starter Growth Suite pricing and packaging change. And then, over the course of Q3 into Q4, what we saw is a much more balanced set of customer additions, which is what sort of leads me to the comments that from one quarter to the next, there\u2019s going to be some difference in the kinds of customers we add, as we introduce different functionality and make pricing and packaging changes.\nBrian Halligan: Keith, on your commerce question, we\u2019ve largely focused on B2B. And I\u2019m kind of thinking like Shopify and HubSpot. They\u2019re the B2C side, we\u2019re on the B2B side. Where we do think there\u2019s opportunity though is increasingly on the B2B side. The way people want to buy is changing. And increasingly, they want a very light touch experience. And increasingly, they want parts of their products and maybe all of their products even on the B2B side to be some sort of an e-commerce each transaction. So, that\u2019s an area we\u2019re very interested in. And I\u2019ll just leave it at that, very interested and we\u2019re investigating and looking at. But B2B commerce is, I think, a nice area of opportunity for start-ups and companies like HubSpot over the next couple of years. B2B buying process inevitably is going to change. And I think, it will change for the better for the vendors and the buyers, and we want to be able to help our customers with that over time.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Kirk Materne from Evercore ISI.\nKirk Materne: Brian, you touched on this in some of your prior comments, but I was just kind of curious how often the concept of a platform now comes up with both, really new customers? Meaning everybody is moving faster from a digital perspective, but as they move faster, are they asking more about sort of I want to make a bet on a platform as my first landing spot versus what you saw maybe a year or two ago? Because I think we can all see the customer adoption that you guys are seeing is accelerating. But, I was kind of curious if the conversations you\u2019re having around that platform are also changing at maybe the same pace.\nBrian Halligan: Yes. I think, we are -- yes, increasingly, people are coming to us and buying the whole platform upfront. And then, just a lot of people who are Marketing Hub customers who are maybe looking at a new CRM, it just is kind of a no-brainer to buy HubSpot. Like, they already know how to use the platform. It\u2019s a single deal with the customer. I mean, it\u2019s kind of a no-brainer. So, it comes up more and more people wanting to buy the whole solutions coming up more and more. Yes, some of the investments we made over the last few years are paying off. And I would just add, Kirk, that we have a ton more work to do on it. Like, I look at our platform as we\u2019ve made tremendous progress over the last couple of years, but there\u2019s -- when I talk to customers, there\u2019s plenty of low-hanging fruit for us on the platform side, and plenty of things they still want us to do. And so, we got a lot of work left to do on it.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Siti Panigrahi from Mizuho.\nSiti Panigrahi: Going back to some earlier question about this, you talked about positive mix shift to Professional and Enterprises. So, last year, after the pandemic broke, you talked about downgrade of subscription. So, how much of this mix shift influenced by those customers operating back versus the newer Starter customer that joined last couple of quarters now upgrading into more Enterprise and Professionals? And have you already upgraded most of them who downgraded right after March-April?\nKate Bueker: Yes. So, what I would say, it really parses into a couple of things. You are absolutely right. We gave a number of concessions -- or we gave a set of concessions to customers in Q2 as part of the initial reaction to the pandemic. And most of those took the form of short-term discounts and flexible payments. We are through the majority. We are through most of those. And so, there is some impact in Q4. It\u2019s not huge. The bigger impact on the duration, it comes from the set of new customers that we\u2019re adding where we are more -- we\u2019re seeing more strength in that professional and enterprise tier.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Derrick Wood from Cowen.\nDerrick Wood: Congrats again on a strong quarter. I wanted to come back to the notion of shifting from a marketing app to a CRM platform. And clearly, that\u2019s gaining momentum. But, I wanted to maybe ask about what\u2019s going on in the channel, and whether existing partners are kind of evolving towards more of that broader platform approach as well, or perhaps there\u2019s kind of a new kind of cohort coming on board from the partner set? It would be nice to hear about how you\u2019re seeing the channel evolve.\nBrian Halligan: That\u2019s an excellent question. Thank you. The channel is definitely evolving. Like, when we first started HubSpot, it was agent -- marketing agency partner channel. I think, we call it the agency partner channel. We call it a solution partner channel now because they are solution partners. And there\u2019s two things going on. Some of those marketing agencies just wanted to do marketing. They\u2019re foreign marketers. They just like marketing, and work in Marketing Hub, and they\u2019ve got a terrific business, and they\u2019re not changing. Some of those marketing agencies though are shifting to be much more of a CRM partner for their customers and really shifted the way their business model works and their value prop works. So, we\u2019re thrilled to see both of those, frankly. And then, if we look at the mix of new partners coming in, we definitely still have marketing agency style partners coming in, but increasingly, it\u2019s CRM implementers. It\u2019s a little bit more technical of a partner, doing a little bit of a bigger implementation, more integration, more customization. So, it\u2019s a little bit of both. Where I think the opportunity is going to be amazing is when people can use our content management system and our CRM system, combine those things together to create awesome experiences for their customers. There\u2019s a lot of opportunity for partners there.\nOperator: That was our last question. At this time, I will turn the call over to Brian Halligan, CEO and Chairman, for closing remarks.\nBrian Halligan: Thanks, everybody, for joining the call today. Thanks a lot. I appreciate it.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Kate Bueker",
            "content": "Thanks, Brian. Let's turn to our fourth quarter and full year financial results, and our guidance for the first quarter and full year of 2021. Fourth quarter revenue growth reaccelerated to 32% year-over-year in constant currency and 35% as reported. Q4 subscription revenue grew 36% year-over-year, while services revenue increased 9% year-over-year on an as-reported basis. Full year 2020 revenue grew 30% in constant currency and 31% as reported. Full year subscription revenue grew 32%, while services revenue grew 5%, again both as reported. We saw strong demand across all of our hubs in Q4, resulting in a reacceleration in new business growth, along with record customer dollar and net revenue retention rates. In Q4, we added 8,400 net customers, ending 2020 with nearly 104,000 total customers, up 42% year-over-year. Average subscription revenue per customer of nearly $9,800 was up slightly sequentially but down a few points year-over-year. Domestic revenue grew 27% in Q4, while international revenue growth was 40% year-over-year in constant currency and 47% as reported. International revenue represented 44% of total revenue in Q4, up 3 points year-over-year. Deferred revenue as of the end of December was $317 million, a 35% increase year-over-year. Calculated billings were $309 million in Q4, growing 38% year-over-year in constant currency and 43% as reported. This reacceleration in constant currency billings growth was driven by strong revenue performance and a positive mix shift toward Professional and Enterprise subscriptions in the quarter. The remainder of my comments will refer to non-GAAP measures. Fourth quarter and full year gross margins were 82% flat year-over-year. Subscription gross margin was 85%, while services gross margin was negative 20%. Fourth quarter operating margin was 10%, up slightly compared to the same period a year ago, as a result of our strong revenue performance in the quarter. Full year operating margin was 8%, flat year-over-year. We invested aggressively in our business over the last year to meet the significant demand for our products and drive innovation to fuel long-term growth. We plan to continue this investment approach in 2021. At the end of the fourth quarter, we had 4,225 employees, up 25% year-over-year. Net income in the fourth quarter was $20 million or $0.40 per diluted share. Net income for the full year was $64 million or $1.32 per diluted share. CapEx, including capitalized software development costs, was $15 million or 6% of revenue for the fourth quarter and $59 million or 7% of revenue for the full year. Free cash flow in the fourth quarter was $46 million or 18% of revenue, and $79 million or 9% of revenue for the full year. Finally, our cash and marketable securities totaled $1.3 billion at the end of December. And with that, let's dive into guidance for the first quarter and full year of 2021. For the first quarter, total revenue is expected to be in the range of $260 million to $265 million, up 32% year-over-year at the midpoint. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be between $17 million and $19 million. Non-GAAP diluted net income per share is expected to be between $0.28 and $0.30. This assumes 50.3 million fully diluted shares outstanding. And for the full year of 2021, total revenue is expected to be in the range of $1.16 billion to $1.17 billion, up 32% year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be between $98 million and $102 million. Non-GAAP diluted net income per share is expected to be between $1.51 and $1.59. This assumes 50.7 million fully diluted shares outstanding. As you adjust your models, keep in mind the following. At current spot rates, we're forecasting an FX tailwind to as-reported revenue of 4 points in Q1 and 3 points for the full year. As many of you are aware, we will have some unusual year-over-year growth comparisons in 2021. With that in mind, I thought it would be helpful to provide some additional color on how we're thinking about cadence of growth throughout 2021. We anticipate revenue growth of 35% in the first half of the year, followed by revenue growth of 30% in the second half of the year as comparisons become more difficult. Our 2021 guidance assumes flat operating margin year-over-year. Embedded in that guidance, we have assumed a healthy level of investment across the business to meet the market demand we're seeing, more normal levels of T&E expense in the back half of the year and continued strong investment in R&D. Lastly, we expect CapEx as a percentage of revenue to be about 5% in 2021 and free cash flow to be about $130 million, with seasonally stronger free cash flow in Q1 and Q4. And with that, I'll hand the call back over to Brian for his closing comments. I think, the theme that you will hear over and over from us is that we believe there's a ton of opportunity ahead and that we're going to continue to reinvest in the business. And so, that's the comment that I would make generally. We are, as you pointed out, assuming that we are largely remote, at least for the first half of the year. There are some modest assumptions that we get back to travel at some point over the course of 2021. But, it doesn't have a dramatic impact on our operating margins for the year. Yes. I think the good news is that we had great things to say about both of those pieces. In terms of retention, I obviously shared in the prepared remarks that we had a record quarter for retention and it's -- what I like about that is, actually, there is just a lot of components that are all complementary in driving the retention in a positive direction. It starts with the fact that we are -- we had record customer dollar retention. And then, our upgrade rates are also hitting new and record levels. In particular, we're seeing some strength in that addition upgrade motion. You want to start, and then I can talk about how we included that in guidance? Yes. Thanks for the question. We obviously are paying a ton of attention. I would say, just like stepping back on that one, we -- what we tried to do in making the changes on the pricing and packaging side there was to just simplify things. And by bringing it together as a suite, putting forward like a $50 price point, it just really simplifies the buying process at the low end. And the learning that we have there is that it was really -- making it easy is super compelling. And so, we think that was a great choice to make. We have been watching the upgrade rates closely. We have been watching the usage rates closely, and we're feeling good about both of those metrics. So, overall, we're feeling great about that Starter Growth Suite play. We do have operational plans underway to try to maximize success on the renewal of those big cohorts. And so, we will continue to share that as appropriate. Yes. I think that as we look at international, it has consistently been stepping up as a larger share of the overall revenue of the Company. And we would expect that that would continue over the next few years. Yes. I mean, that's a question we spend a lot of time talking about internally as well. I think, you just kind of turned clock back a little bit. At the time of the IPO, we had sort of a net retention in the mid-90s. Over the last couple of years, that has stepped up, and we've been saying in and around 100. Look, we're -- we've reached a new gear here in the last couple of quarters, and we're not calling a new normal, but the performance over the last couple of quarters certainly gives me a lot of confidence that we'll be able to keep retention at or above 100. Yes. You're -- again, we're hitting it on all the really hard ones here. Yes, we were obviously very excited about the incremental net adds in Q4. I think, the thing that I liked about it, which seems like we're aligned on, is that the customer growth was very balanced across the Starter and the Professional, Enterprise. And so, it translated also into a quarter-over-quarter increase in ASRPC. Honestly, you're going to see some quarters where you have less customer adds, and they're going to be at the high end, and you're going to see bigger increases in ASRPC. You're going to see other quarters where you have a concentration of the customer additions at the low end and a little bit more pressure in ASRPC. The good news is that when we look at the Starter and we look at Professional and Enterprise, each of those is expanding. And so, we feel good. Yes. I mean, it definitely feels like we've sort of hit a new level. You've seen now three quarters where you have broken away from that, what we had been at that, call it, 3,000, 4,000 customer adds per quarter. And we feel good about our ability to continue to operate at that new level. Now, that doesn't mean that I would translate it in to 8,000 to 9,000 a quarter. I do think, as I was talking about a little bit earlier, there'll be some variability from one quarter to the next, based on whether we're seeing some strength at the low end or strength at the high end. No, I think on the go-to-market side, we continue to invest to be able to service the demand that we're seeing in the market. And we talked about the fact that we're investing where we feel like we have this A, on the go-to-market and product in the middle and that we're investing both upmarket and also in tech touch at the low end. Yes. I think, that the message that you should hear from us is that the priority is on continuing to invest in the business to drive long-term growth. That said, we have a framework. And over the long term, we will continue to follow that framework. But, in the near term, I think, you shouldn't expect a linear movement. It's relatively balanced. We -- across those factors, there's a bunch of stuff that plays into it. Yes, there was. And I think as many people who listen to these calls would probably know, billings is not my favorite metric out there. There's just a lot of stuff that happens with billings that can confuse people. That said, on -- again, over the long term, constant currency revenue and constant currency billings are going to track one another. You see quarter-over-quarter some volatility there. By the way, I'm getting like 7 packages delivered. So, I'm [indiscernible] background here. I don't know how to shut it off. So last quarter, we did see constant currency billings above constant currency revenue. A few points of that is a result of the fact that we're getting some advantage from a duration extension. The Professional and Enterprise additions performed really well, and those tend to have longer billing terms than the lower-end Starter products. There was another small bit here that was helpful. Some of the customers that we had given short-term plays to in Q2 at the onset of the pandemic were coming off of those sort of discounts or flexible payment terms. And so, they billed again in Q4. It was a smaller factor. And then, the remaining performance of billings was really just strong bookings for the quarter. We are largely through the impact of COVID plays. Yes. Sure. In terms of new customer adds, I think, what you saw this year, 2020, was that the initial step-up that we saw in Q2 and then into Q3 was very much associated with the Starter Growth Suite pricing and packaging change. And then, over the course of Q3 into Q4, what we saw is a much more balanced set of customer additions, which is what sort of leads me to the comments that from one quarter to the next, there's going to be some difference in the kinds of customers we add, as we introduce different functionality and make pricing and packaging changes. Yes. So, what I would say, it really parses into a couple of things. You are absolutely right. We gave a number of concessions -- or we gave a set of concessions to customers in Q2 as part of the initial reaction to the pandemic. And most of those took the form of short-term discounts and flexible payments. We are through the majority. We are through most of those. And so, there is some impact in Q4. It's not huge. The bigger impact on the duration, it comes from the set of new customers that we're adding where we are more -- we're seeing more strength in that professional and enterprise tier."

            "content": "Thanks, Chuck. Good afternoon, folks. Thank you for joining us today to review HubSpot's fourth quarter and full year 2020 earnings results. I'm exceptionally proud of how HubSpot team closed out the year. In Q4, we saw a nice reacceleration in revenue growth of 35% year-over-year. During the quarter, we surpassed 100,000 customers. And in December, we crossed $1 billion in ARR, two terrific milestones on which to end the year. So, what's behind this reacceleration in growth? Well, this unusual year opened up everyone's eyes to just how early we still are in the digital transformation of the economy. This is the trend we've been seeing for 14 years and it was sped up for obvious reasons this year. New startups we work with, while they're born digital, older scaleups we work with who may have only been partially online in the past, have begun to fully digitize their end-to-end experience. HubSpot has the ideal platform to enable all these companies to build delightful modern experiences for their customers. Another trend we've seen is a shift in the market's expectations for B2B software. People now expect it to work like the consumer software they use in their personal lives. Traditional enterprise CRMs are cobbled together through lots of acquisitions, and the resulting user experience, well, it's pretty rough. Our CRM, it's crafted internally with a consumer-like UI matched with a scalable enterprise back end. This approach is resonating very well in the marketplace. All of our products in all of our geographies performed well in Q4. In particular, we saw strong growth in our enterprise tier. This year, we did launches of our Marketing Hub Enterprise product, our CMS Hub Enterprise product and our Sales Hub and Enterprise products. These all did well individually in the market. But, the thing that really stood out was the number of companies buying two or more of our hubs, taking advantage of having their entire go-to-market on one platform with one data model, one representation of their customer and one user interface. We're super pleased that our unique approach was recognized just the other day when HubSpot was named the number 2 Best Global Software Seller according to user reviews on G2 Crowd. We were wedged right between Microsoft and Zoom. So, much has changed about the relationship between companies and their customers this year, and so much opportunity still lies ahead. After a strong finish to the year, the team is more motivated than ever to help our customers create remarkable end-to-end customer experiences and grow better in 2021. With that, I'll hand it over to Kate. Thanks, Kate. Those numbers reflect how nicely our customer flywheel is spinning. Well, our employee flywheel is spinning nicely, too. We were just recognized as the Fourth Best Place to Work in 2021 by Glassdoor. Last month, Comparably also highlighted HubSpot as being the number 1 Best Workplace for Women and a Top Place to Work for Parents. We endeavored not just to talk the talk on diversity inclusion but walk the walk. We have a variety of initiatives underway, but two new ones I'm particularly proud of our $20 million commitment to social impact investing in a new partnership with Howard University, which established a new Center for Digital Business on their campus. The difficult years are always the ones that define you, and I'm grateful to every HubSpotter and our partner community for the way we all pulled together to end the year strong and start 2021 with momentum. I'm super grateful to the 100,000 customers who put their trust in us. Thank you for your time. Operator, let's open up the call for a few questions. Hey Mark, thanks for your question. I was super pleased to see that sort of sandwiched between two terrific software companies, Zoom and Microsoft. And I think it's just a reflection of a lot of the bets we've made over the last couple of years. Products just gotten way better, our customers are way happier, and they've given us really good reviews there on G2. So, really happy about it. In terms of kind of the second part of your question, I mean, things are good. I mean, we're seeing nice momentum kind of across all three tiers of the product, the Enterprise, the Pro and the Starter, and across kind of all the geographies. So, feeling good. Things are going well. Thanks for your question. Yes. I'll just add to that, like some of the investments we made are really paying off in -- it's a leading indicator but NP -- our Net Promoter Score is something we've been obsessed about for a couple of years. In this past year, it went way up, like the investments we made are really paying off. And then, graduation rates. Typically, it's like a 300-person company that has been with us since they were 30 and they're 3,000. [Ph] A lot of times you graduate there. I just think the power we've added to the platform is really paying off, and people are sticking around longer and enjoying the new sophisticated [indiscernible]. Well, when I think of HubSpot, Samad, it's like the bottom of the second inning in our baseball game. It still feels early. There is a giant market out there for CRM. We're kind of mid-transition from moving as a company from being a marketing app to try and become the number 1 CRM for scaling companies. So, you're going to see us continue to improve the product, improve the go-to-market, improve the way we execute. We are sort of tireless in our desire to get better and to deliver more value to our customers. So, continue -- it's not -- this isn't a steady state kind of company, a lot more investment coming, a lot more innovation, more products, existing products getting better. It still feels early in my head, my friend. Do you want me to take that? Do you want to take that, Kate? Sure. I'll just sort of reiterate what I kind of talked about earlier, Stan, where there's a couple of drivers going on here. I mean, COVID just sort of accelerated people's digitization moves. Like, I think everybody knew they need to completely digitize their go-to-market, and this just sort of accelerated it. And so, the demand has been strong. I don't see that demand going back. I feel like people are going to lean into the future going forward. So, the demand's strong. Our target market -- so the whole market is growing, and then our target market is also expanding. If you think about it, like we're moving from a marketing app to a CRM platform. That CRM market is much bigger than the marketing app market. And we're doing -- we're starting to do really well and make a lot of progress on there. And so, the market is large and growing. And so, we're just kind of really well positioned to lean into it. I also would just say, Stan, like our competitive positioning is super unique and super compelling for prospects and customers. So, our win rates are going up and our retention rates are going up. Like, things are really good. Some of those bets we've been making over the last couple of years we've been talking about, they're really starting to pay off for us over the last year. Sure. This is Brian, Nick. I can take that. Really happy with -- frankly, we're really happy with both, the international growth and the domestic growth. Domestic growth really picked up nicely. I think, it's just a testament to -- the market is quite big, and I think it's growing. Now, when you look at the market versus -- U.S. versus international, really, all our segments are doing well. Like, across the geography, small business, the mid-market and the enterprise segment are doing well. And then, both our channels seem to be doing well, our direct channel and our indirect channel. Our partner channel seems to be doing well. I think, it's just a reflection that the product's gotten better, the value prop is getting better, our flywheel's spinning really nicely. Maybe Kate's got something to add to that. Yes. Arjun, great question. The transition has gone real well. When I think about HubSpot, I can't help but think about the Clive Bell [ph] rule. I'm not sure if you're familiar with that. But like, if you have one Clive Bell that can pull 1,000 pounds. And then you add a second Clive Bell that can pull 1,000 pounds, the really interesting thing that happens is that combined Clive Bell can pull 4,000 pounds of stuff. That's HubSpot. We have our Marketing Hub, we have our Sales Hub, our Service Hub, our CMS Hub. They're all built on this set of shared services underneath. The UI is the same. It's a single data model. It's a beautiful consumer-like front end and a powerful enterprise back end. And so, we're seeing nice adoption of that, a nice pickup from new customers who are buying full suite, particularly the Starter suite, and lots of existing customers from our Marketing Hub or Sales Hub buying other hubs. So, getting really good traction, particularly with new customers, but also the installed base. Excellent question, DJ. Excellent question. I do think of HubSpot as a CDP where we do a fantastic job of collecting all kinds of data about all the touch points you have with your prospects and customers, whether that's visits to your website or they fill out a form or they're chatting with you in the website or they have a call with your sales rep, whether they don't fill on a ticket, whatever it would be, and then we combine them together and have this one unified view of the customer, that makes it incredibly valuable for the whole organization. Where you'll see us go over time, it's getting better and better, not just us collecting that data that it is managed by HubSpot, but with all of your front office applications and pulling all that together and making sense for our prospects with it. So, that's an area we're investing in. Super excited about our customers who want it. And keep your eyes on that channel. Brian, thanks for the question. Sales Hub has a ton of potential. We rereleased Sales Hub Enterprise at INBOUND last year, and we've had very strong demand for it over the last few months. And we have a whole bunch of good stuff keyed up for Sales Hub Enterprise this year and next. So, that product is going to get very, very legit. Very, very bullish on the future of that product. In terms of the size, we're definitely closing bigger deals. We closed a couple of offers in Q4 with many hundreds of seats. So, I think -- and we just see a lot more deals in our pipeline with larger seat volumes. So, it's -- the strategy and the investments are starting to pay off there on Sales Hub where the deal sizes are getting big. One of the things we've just been working on, like, if I think of HubSpot, I step back and think about it, we're really strong in that -- in the very middle of the market, like 20 to 200 employees. And I give it like an A plus on our product market fit, our go-to-market market fit there. Where we're working hard on is that 200 to 2,000, what we call the enterprise, and then the 2 to 20. Lots of investments going in last year and this year in those areas, and we think we're going to make a lot of progress there. I hear Jeff Bezos talk about this. But, like in a given quarter, the stuff that's happening now, stuff that best we've made really over the last couple of years. So like what happens this month doesn't really impact Q1 that much. So I'm not shocked that we're seeing such good results and we have such good guidance and we've reaccelerated. Like, we've made some -- in a couple of cases, we're really done like the two steps back so we could take four steps forward. And we're just getting the return on some of those bets. And then, our market is bigger. We moved from a marketing app market, which is the gold market and not small and growing, to your whole darn front office. The CRM market is much, much bigger, and it's just a lot -- everyone needs one. It's not an optional thing. And whether you're a start-up buying your first one or you're a scale-up and you're not happy with what you've got, we're just a great fit these days, and we've become a better fit over the last couple of years. Our competitive advantages have increased. It's a little bit boring and a little old school. But, our value proposition has just gotten better. We win more deals and we retain customers longer, and we delight our customers. It's a little bit of very old fashioned, but it works. Thank you. Yes. That's a good question. If I sort of back up and think about it like -- I've been in this world of CRM since -- literally since 1990 when I graduated college. And many times over my career, I was in the position of either buying and implementing or using a CRM. And there's the tried-and-true playbook for how you do this, and it's been around for a long time, where someone built an SFA application. And then, they buy a whole bunch of stuff and cobble together this giant frank in CRM. And we're seeing there's several of them in the market today. And it's a good way to build a business. We decided to kind of zag when everyone else was zigging on that playbook. And we decided instead of cobbling this thing together, let's crack it, sort of Apple style and make it a beautiful application. Our development team, our product designers, our user research people are really good. The tools that we use and the platform we use internally is so powerful. And so, we've decided to build it. And we think it's unique and differentiated and it really matters to the end users and the ops people to implement this stuff. Now, given that, underneath HubSpot, we have this set of shared services, and we've exposed them through four hubs today. But we aren't done. It's still pretty early innings for HubSpot. There's a lot more stuff in our heads and on our drawing boards, where we can -- that we can expose through additional hubs down the road. I'm not going to show my hand at when those hubs are coming and what they are, but we're not done. There's more opportunity out there for HubSpot, still early innings. Yes. Thanks for the question, Drew. I kind of think of HubSpot as we have Marketing Hub, which is the OG hub, going really well, growing fast at scale, big market. We're going to continue to grow. And you got Sales Hub, good-sized business now. Wow, is it growing fast, lots of opportunity there. And then, you got CMS Hub and the Service Hub. Those hubs to me look a lot like the Sales Hub looked two, three years into that evolution. And so, hopefully, three years from now, we have Marketing Hub and Sales Hub both at scale and then these two hubs are cranking or big businesses. And then, there's new hubs kind of coming along. So, it's sort of like Horizon theory. Horizon theories 1, Horizon 1 bets Horizon 2 bets Horizon 3 bets. We have sort of bets along those horizons and the maturing and new bets that will come on line. The new hubs are doing well. CMS Hub and Service Hub doing well. Remind me a lot of Sales Hub. I think, they'll be big businesses. The combination -- the Clive Bell combination of these things is going to be really, really powerful over time. Yes. It's -- we're super interested, and we're investing heavily in that. If you take a step back, you think about most of the communication that happens with ASIC or e-mail. And then, just increasingly, people want to do synchronous messaging types of communication, and that comes to likely lots and lots of different ways these days, lots of way to message. The one you're talking about sort of chat on the website and building box that automates that chat, that's an area we've invested a lot in. And we have a great offering in the market today that our customers are buying. It works on your website if you've got an app, it'll work inside your app. All of that gets pulled into a central place, and people can respond to those in real-time. That's an area we're super excited about. That's an area of growth for HubSpot. That's an area where human behavior is changing. And I think HubSpot is quite good at staying on top of these changes in helping people deal with them. So, it's a great question. We're really excited about that space. Sure. We've been investing relatively heavily in R&D over the last several years, and we're going to continue to do it. We feel like we're getting nice returns on it, showing up in a retention rate, net promoter score revenue growth like -- the leading indicators look good. The lagging indicators look good, too. So, we're going to keep investing there. We're going to invest in our existing products. So, you saw we have a playbook where we can go into an existing product, hub and kind of relaunch it, really go after it again. And that works really well for us. And then, we'll build some new hubs and new capabilities. Our R&D team is kind of on fire these days. So, we're going to see results from those folks. Kate, do you want to add anything to that? No. Lots of watering, lots of fertilizing, lots of work left to do. Let's just pick out Service Hub. The product is terrific, let's say, if you're a 50, 75-person company, if you're a 500 or 750-person company, there's some stuff that's still missing. And it kind of reminds me of Sales Hub a couple of years ago. If you're a 500, 750- person company, like you're closed guys, but there's a subtle gap. It's very, very similar. We know what the gaps are. And in our own way, leveraging the primary collars, we're filling those gaps. There's plenty of water, plenty of fertilizers left to do. And I would say that also for the Marketing Hub product. Like, we've had that product out there for 14.5 years. There's still plenty of low-hanging fruit at Marketing Hub product. It's a terrific product. But even this year, it's going to get a lot better. And so, yes, we don't see HubSpot as sort of the fix thing, like there's going to be a lot of innovation across new and existing hubs over time. Yes. I would just say new and cross-sell both performed well. Great question. Alex, when we started HubSpot, it was on this idea of inbound marketing. And the problem with marketers is they're always renting space on someone else's assets, a radio show, a TV show, a newspaper, and increasingly more recently, a social network or a search engine. And the idea behind inbound marketing was instead of renting space in somebody else's assets, well, just create your own asset, increase the number of those assets and increase the return you're getting on those assets. What I love about the Hustle folks is they had some unbelievable assets. They had a newsletter asset. Very, very, very modern and news newsletter, those things are taking off. They have the best one in the business in our opinion. They have a fantastic podcast and very deep research. So, it's a little bit of an acquirer to get that terrific talent and all those assets that we plan to invest in and grow over time. So, we're super, super excited about the Hustle. We think it's going to be a fair advantage on the marketing side, for sure. Yes. That's a terrific question, Jennifer. In a start-up, we're typically the first legit system they have in place, like the first legit CRM they'll put in place, which is where we want to be and then we want to scale with them. In a scaleup, oftentimes, someone have put in -- tried to put in a CRM, it just didn't go well. It's too hard to set up. It was too hard to use and too complicated. And they got it sort of partly set up, and then they just said that they can't see a better way to do this stuff. And they find HubSpot, and they implement us. And that's starting to happen more and more. We've been talking about that for a while, but we're starting to see more of that in the market. I think, it's a testament to our approach. It's a patient person's approach to build all this stuff. But, I think that patience is paying off. I also think our go-to-market, Jennifer, really helps us in that area where, to engage with one of those traditional CRM players, into free trial. It's not premium. You got to deal with a whole bunch of sales reps to get anything done. And we've got a super modern approach to the way people do it. And I think people like it. They want to use a free product and give it a run. They want to try it. They want a trial. And yes, they want talk to a sales rep, they engage and learn about it and pricing and packaging and negotiating and helping them get set up. But, I think our approach to letting people really use it matches the way they buy. I also think it really highlights our strength that it is easy to use and set up. It's very modern. And I think HubSpot is a little bit like Zoom. Zoom's not only a better product, but the go-to-market is much lighter. It's much easier to buy, like we want to be more like that. I think that's the future of that, it's more like that. You should take the first one. I'll take the second one, Kate. Keith, on your commerce question, we've largely focused on B2B. And I'm kind of thinking like Shopify and HubSpot. They're the B2C side, we're on the B2B side. Where we do think there's opportunity though is increasingly on the B2B side. The way people want to buy is changing. And increasingly, they want a very light touch experience. And increasingly, they want parts of their products and maybe all of their products even on the B2B side to be some sort of an e-commerce each transaction. So, that's an area we're very interested in. And I'll just leave it at that, very interested and we're investigating and looking at. But B2B commerce is, I think, a nice area of opportunity for start-ups and companies like HubSpot over the next couple of years. B2B buying process inevitably is going to change. And I think, it will change for the better for the vendors and the buyers, and we want to be able to help our customers with that over time. Yes. I think, we are -- yes, increasingly, people are coming to us and buying the whole platform upfront. And then, just a lot of people who are Marketing Hub customers who are maybe looking at a new CRM, it just is kind of a no-brainer to buy HubSpot. Like, they already know how to use the platform. It's a single deal with the customer. I mean, it's kind of a no-brainer. So, it comes up more and more people wanting to buy the whole solutions coming up more and more. Yes, some of the investments we made over the last few years are paying off. And I would just add, Kirk, that we have a ton more work to do on it. Like, I look at our platform as we've made tremendous progress over the last couple of years, but there's -- when I talk to customers, there's plenty of low-hanging fruit for us on the platform side, and plenty of things they still want us to do. And so, we got a lot of work left to do on it. That's an excellent question. Thank you. The channel is definitely evolving. Like, when we first started HubSpot, it was agent -- marketing agency partner channel. I think, we call it the agency partner channel. We call it a solution partner channel now because they are solution partners. And there's two things going on. Some of those marketing agencies just wanted to do marketing. They're foreign marketers. They just like marketing, and work in Marketing Hub, and they've got a terrific business, and they're not changing. Some of those marketing agencies though are shifting to be much more of a CRM partner for their customers and really shifted the way their business model works and their value prop works. So, we're thrilled to see both of those, frankly. And then, if we look at the mix of new partners coming in, we definitely still have marketing agency style partners coming in, but increasingly, it's CRM implementers. It's a little bit more technical of a partner, doing a little bit of a bigger implementation, more integration, more customization. So, it's a little bit of both. Where I think the opportunity is going to be amazing is when people can use our content management system and our CRM system, combine those things together to create awesome experiences for their customers. There's a lot of opportunity for partners there. Thanks, everybody, for joining the call today. Thanks a lot. I appreciate it."

Now, it's my pleasure to turn over the call to HubSpot's CEO and Chairman, Brian Halligan. \nBrian Halligan: Thanks, Chuck. Good afternoon, folks. Thank you for joining us today. While none of us could have foreseen the difficult path this year would take, as we enter the final quarter of 2020, I'm grateful for our customers, partners and employees that have grown through it with us. Despite this challenging environment, HubSpot has grown very nicely. Demand trends have continued to strengthen in the third quarter as more companies digitized their end-to-end customer experience and built modern flywheels. Revenue growth was 32% in Q3 and non-GAAP operating margin was 7%. We had a record total customer growth of 39% year-over-year, surpassing 95,000, while multi-product adoption is also continued to grow nicely representing over 45,000 customers. These customers have also become more embedded in the HubSpot ecosystem, as we reached nearly 2 million cumulative platform integrations. The year is not over, but I believe the growth we've seen in the third quarter is both a story of digital transformation tailwind combined with excellent execution by our team's build and deliver a terrific product for our customers. A big focus for 2020 is on building a CRM platform, that couples an increasingly powerful enterprise back-end with an intuitive consumer grade in front it. This is a rare combination that software industry is unique to us in the CRM industry. That rare combination is a result of a few things. First, we hand crafted HubSpot on a set of internal primary colors reporting content, messaging, data and automation. These primary colors are combined to create our Hub which all work the same intuitive way. This is in contrast to traditional CRMs, which are coupled together through acquisition. Second, we have a large multi-year investment in user research and design that gives HubSpot that consumer-like feel. Third, our entire company is laser-focused on delighting our customers. Culturally over the last few years, we've moved from a funnel mindset to a flywheel mindset, where our growth rate is heavily influenced by the values our customers are getting from our offering. The really exciting thing that happened since we spoke last was the release of Sales Hub Enterprise which leverages these primary colors as custom objects, as proposal, as advanced sales automation, and as the economic integrations, like NetSuite, QuickBooks and Xero to our CRM. This was the huge release for our customers and partners, in particular, the addition of custom object changes the game for a lot of our customers. Custom objects was the very large investment for us that took well over a year to develop. Prior to this release, our customers had to set their business model into a relatively rigid object model. Now, our customers can set our object model around their business model. This was a big block for us with scale businesses that we've knocked down. One customer, LegalZoom, an early sales Hub Enterprise adopter, praised this intersection of power and ease we provide by saying - - we have had a 100% user adoption and we couldn't be happier. Now, it's still early days, but we had a strong start with sales of enterprise net new AOR, giving a record high in October. There is still a lot of uncertainty in the world today, so it's hard to predict the future. But one thing I'm certain of, is our approach to building products that delight customers, it's going to keep paying off. I want to thank you for your time so far today. We're proud of the momentum we've done in Q3 and remain optimistic and focused on closing out the year strong. Now, I'll hand things over to Kate to take you through our Q3 financial and operating results in more detail.\nKathryn Bueker: Thanks, Brian. Let's turn to our third quarter financial results and our guidance for the fourth quarter and full year 2020. Third quarter revenue growth re-accelerated to 30% year-over-year in constant currency and 32% as reported. Q3 subscription revenue grew 32% year-over-year, while services revenue increased 12% year-over-year on an as-reported basis. Domestic revenue grew 20% in Q3, while international revenue growth was 39% year-over-year in constant currency and 40% as reported. International revenue represented 44% of total revenue in Q3, up 3 points year-over-year. Deferred revenue as of the end of September was $259 million, a 27% increase year-over-year. Calculated billings were $246 million in Q3, up 33% in constant currency and 38% year-over-year on an as-reported basis. Earlier in the year, we introduced proactive measures to provide customers and partners the flexibility needed to remain productive and engaged parts of the HubSpot's ecosystem. As I shared at the Analyst Day, we saw the vast majority of these COVID customer relief requests in the first half of the year. Overall, we continue to see a small number of new requests and the retention of our customers at the end of the short-term plays remains strong. We continue to watch these trends carefully, particularly given the recent uptick in global COVID cases. We also saw continued strength in demand from new customers during the quarter. We ended Q3 with over 95,000 total customers, up 39% year-over-year. Net customer additions were nearly 9,000 and set another company record, driven by broad strength across the business, although we continue to see notable growth in our starter growth suite customers. Average subscription revenue per customer of roughly $9,700 was up a few points sequentially, but down year-over-year, as a result of the strength that we've seen at the low end of the portfolio. Total revenue retention was greater than 100% in Q3. While retention benefited from the performance of customers upgrading at the end of short-term discount, revenue retention would have remained above 100% without this benefit. The remainder of my comments will refer to non-GAAP measures. Third quarter gross margin was 82%, flat year-over-year. Subscription gross margin was 86% while services gross margin was negative 20%. Third quarter operating margin was 7%, up 1.0 compared to the same period last year. Operating margin in the quarter exceeded our expectations, primarily as a result of strong revenue performance. At the end of the third quarter, we had nearly 4,000 employees, up 20% year-over-year. Net income in the third quarter was $40 million or $0.28 per diluted share. CapEx, including capitalized software development costs, was $30 million or 6% of revenue in the quarter. We expect CapEx, as a percentage of revenue, to be 6% to 7% in 2020. Free cash flow in the third quarter was $25 million, driven by strong business performance. As a result we're increasing our expectations for full year 2020 free cash flow to approximately $60 million. HubSpot ended the quarter with $1.2 billion of cash and marketable securities. We remain confident that our strong balance sheet will provide us with the financial flexibility to invest for the long term. And with that let's dive into guidance for the fourth quarter and full year of 2020. For the fourth quarter, total revenue is expected to be in the range of $235 million to $237 million dollars, up 27% year-over-year at the midpoint. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be between $13 million and $15 million. Non-GAAP diluted net income per share is expected to be between 21% and 23%. This assumes 49.6 million fully diluted shares outstanding and for the full year of 2020 total revenue is expected to be in the range of $866 million to $868 million, up 28% year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $63.5 million and $65.5 million. Non-GAAP diluted net income per share is expected to be between $1.13 and $1.15. This assumes 48.7 million fully diluted shares outstanding. As you adjust your models, keep in mind the following. At current spot rates, we expect a 2 point FX tailwind to Q4 reported revenue and now expect a neutral FX impact to reported revenue for the full year of 2020. We have delivered modest operating margin leverage in 2020 as a result of our strong business performance, coupled with some cost savings from our shift to remote work. At our Analyst Day, I reiterated our commitment to investing for the long term and indicated that we expect to increase our R&D spending as a percentage of revenue. As a result of this increase, coupled with a return to a more normal level of employee spend over the next year, we do not expect to deliver operating margin leverage in 2021. We are still early in our planning process, so we will share a more detailed outlook for profitability when we report our Q4 results. The investments we're making in both our product and go-to-market teams are paying off and will position us well to grow in 2021 and beyond. And with that, I'll hand the call back over to Brian for his closing remarks.\nBrian Halligan: I'd like to close by thanking my leadership team and all the HubSpotters out there who are listening tonight. It's been an exceptionally challenging year. You all have stepped up during these tough times, with great execution and terrific resilience. I feel lucky to be on your team. Okay, operator, let's open it up to some questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Mark Murphy from JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\nMark Murphy: Yes, thank you very much and congrats on a very special performance. Brian, I was thinking back to inbound, you had commented that this is the year that you started adding legitimate power to the platform and now we're hearing so much discussion of custom objects. Are you surprised at how quickly the enterprise functionality has resonated in this kind of environment? And do you see more activity at the upper bound of your target market in terms of company size?\nBrian Halligan: Hey Mark, I read your report when it came out, I thought it was great. I'm not that surprised. There's been a lot of hard work that's gone in on the platform level or custom object side of things and it's been really going on for a long period of time and this was the year we really wanted to strengthen that enterprise tier of our products, the products that we sell into like 200 to 2000 level. Customers -- and we knew for customers of that size a major objection from existing customers who were graduating and new potential customers was -- gosh, we get this evolving business model, but we have to jam our business model into your relatively fixed object model, into your contacts, companies, deals. It's sort of rigid the way we structured it, and what custom object gives the ability to do is wrap HubSpot in our object model around an evolving a more complicated business model. So this makes us a better fit, for example for a university, there can be a student object, for a SaaS company, there can be a subscription object. There can be for manufacturing company, inventory could be an object, so just gives you a ton more flexibility if you're a scaling company. And so I'm not shocked that we're getting good adoption. It's a loud noise from that to your customer for us for a number of years and so we undertook that project in part of last year and it came out great. The nice thing about Sales Hub Enterprise and about the custom object is they're part and parcel of HubSpot, so they inherit all the great automation and all other great reporting, and I'm kind of bolted in there, it's sort of like an apple-like field and they are really powerful and really easy to use. So, I guess I'm not shocked.\nMark Murphy: Okay, great. Now, Kate, I had a mathematical question for you, I was trying to run the math at the Analyst Day. I think it said Marketing Hub was over $600 million growing at least 20% and Sales Hub I think over $160 million growing 60%. I ran the math on that, it looks like you're almost booking as much new business with Sales Hub now as you are with Marketing Hub; it's getting close, kind of this twin-engine situation. Is it fair to start thinking of it that way already this soon or is it possible we'd see a crossover there in the next couple of years? Because I was also considering, I think Brian just said that October actually -- I thought you said October not September, was the highest level you've hit for Sales Hub Enterprise net new IRR. I'm trying to kind of tie all that together and see what you think?\nKathryn Bueker: I think you're going to see enhancing of the flows across the Marketing Hub and the Sales Hub over time. I think they're both great engines for the company and I think they're both going to be big growth drivers to come.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Alex Zukin from RBC. Please go ahead.\nAlex Zukin: Hey guys, thanks for taking the question. Maybe the first one on what you're seeing with respect to sales cycles, the demand environment in the pipeline, how is that different from, call it, 90 days ago and even since inbound, what you saw come out of inbound? Because it does feel like some of the results are posting the billings numbers, it does feel like there is a bit of acceleration in terms of the priority set that you're solving for customers. So just any high-level comments, and then I've got a quick follow-up on everybody's favourite topic of billings.\nBrian Halligan: Hey, Alex. It's an interesting year, like if I think about this year, the year started really strong January and February. We were very bullish about this year internally, we've done a lot of: hard work last year to kind of get ready, so starting with the kind of the deal end of March to early June, huge headwind and in starting at the end of June, that headwind turned into a tailwind, and that tailwind blew all through Q3, it blew through October too. I'm pretty happy with where we're sitting at the moment, things are going really well and again, I think we're very well-positioned to help our customers through and get some credit for that. I also want to give some credit to a lot of hard work from the team in execution over the last couple of years to put us in this position, so it's a little bit of both. It's hard to say with the election and the shutdown, I'm not sure what's going to happen over the next 6 months.  I'm pretty optimistic, like the pipeline looks good, customers are quite happier, value prop is quite stronger, products are getting better. Customers need to move from an outbound model to an inbound model, from outside selling to inside selling, from offline to online. Our product is a really, really good fit for that type of thing. And so, I'm feeling quite positive these days actually.\nAlex Zukin: And Brian, I guess when you think about -- as you look to next year, you're clearly going to invest to take advantage of the growth. A lot of investors and companies start thinking about comps for -- some comps are easing, some comps are getting tougher depending on what kind of software you're selling. But for you, it feels like because of the way you're coming out of it and the sales cycles are working and everything is resonating, is it possible that if we do get stimulus you could actually accelerate as we look at next year? What's the right way for us to think about that and any tie in with the puts and takes around billings that we should keep in mind, both next quarter and just in general from here?\nBrian Halligan: I don't know, is the honest answer, I don't know if the stimulus is coming and I don't know what the impact will be on HubSpot. I can say -- I really think a lot about what I can control and what I can influence. I can influence our employees and our customers and our partners and I think we're in very good shape, like you've been tracking our company for a long time, just feeling really very solid about where we sit. And I think -- really think way back, like when we first went public it seems like 100 years ago. We were just making the transition from a marketing app to a CRM platform and we're making great progress on that. It's a multi-year arc and we made huge investments, it's still pretty early in that arc, like our vision for what a modern CRM value prop is, the company's relative to what we've built. We made a lot of progress, there's a lot more progress to come. So in general, feeling quite good these days. \nAlex Zukin: And then Kate, anything on billings that we should be aware of, given the different terms for some of your products now in the market?\nKathryn Bueker: I guess last time we talked about a compression and the upfront duration of billings. I think we have a different conversation to have this quarter. I would to start frankly with the reminder that the FX is different on billings than it is on revenue. And so, there was a 5 point benefit to billings in Q3. So the number I would really focus on is that constant currency billings growth of 33% and there is a couple of things I would point out. One is, strong business performance is going to drive strong revenue growth and strong billings growth, but quarter-over-quarter, we did see an improvement to the billing duration and some of that is a mix where we saw some strengths in Marketing Hub and the Pro and Enterprise skews, but we also saw a bit of a tailwind just like we saw with to retention to the return to normal billing or some of the customers that we're under these short-term COVID discounts as they came out the other side. I would advise just long-term the great anchor point really still is constant currency revenue and constant currency billing tracking.\nBrian Halligan: Alex, we're getting some feedback there so we had to mute your line. Thanks for the questions. Operator, if we could take the next one.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Samad Samana from Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nSamad Samana: Hi, good evening. Thanks for taking my question. Let me echo, the very strong results were great to see. Kate, maybe first question for you. It was a really impressive performance in that net adds is up quite a bit quarter-over-quarter, but ASRPC also increased quarter-over-quarter. So is it fair to assume that the company either had more Pro and Enterprise signings as a percentage of the mix in Q3 or was that a function of something else?\nKathryn Bueker: Thanks for the question. We are obviously really happy with the new customer adds for the quarter. I would say starter growth suite was another quarter of really strong adds and so that was a big driver of the customer count growth in Q3. But one of the things that I liked about the quarter was that we also had really strong adds in the Professional and Enterprise additions and frankly, both in Marketing and in Sales. I would caution us not to expect 8,000 or 9,000 new customers every quarter, but it was a great quarter for new customer add. As far as ASRPC, some of the sequential uptick is going to be attributed exactly as you expected to a bit more in the Professional and Enterprise customer adds. I think there is also a little bit of help there from the customer coming off of the short-term discounts and going back to more normal pricing. I would just finish, we talked about how we're expecting the ASRPC was going to be under pressure for the next few quarters at least, as the customer mix shifts to that starter tier. I think that still holds true.\nSamad Samana: Okay, great. That's helpful for modeling. And then, Brian, maybe just a follow-up for you, if we may be zoom out, we've now been stuck at home for almost 7 to 8 months. But what we've seen for you guys is even ex the upgrades off of discount or pricing, that a pretty strong net retention. So it seems like existing customers are buying again and adding additional products. Could you may be help us just as stepping back, what are customers prioritizing as they adjust our new reality particularly heading into 2021 and how that's translating into selling back into the base?\nBrian Halligan: I think everybody now -- so many companies had on their to-do lists to really digitize their go-to market. There's very few people in the world today that say that's a bad idea. Ten years ago we were early starting up; people though we were crazy with all of inbound. It becomes pretty mainstream and I think COVID might have sped up the plans on there, people add vols in their prospects at home and their customers at home in all and -- works kind of a compelling event to see people up to really digitize their go-to market and HubSpot was very well-positioned for that. And we built a platform to help people digitize their entire go-to market to create new modern flywheel, to create a really terrific customer experience. I don't think it should be that surprising that we've done really well. I do think we are very well-positioned. I think we're very well-positioned going forward too, like the advances we've made on the product and the improvements we've made as the go-to-market have been substantial over the last year and I think we're getting nice returns on those.\nSamad Samana: Great, thanks for that. It's good to see all the investments paying off. Have a great night.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Stan Zlotsky from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nStan Zlotsky: Perfect, thank you so much. When I was reading the press release, one thing that really kind of stuck out was that the some of the benefits that you're seeing right now is, the way you guys put it, from the ongoing digital transformation of the mid-market. That particular mid-market is a statement. Is that the way that you are viewing yourselves now as in -- yes, you definitely have a very strong solution for the SMB and that's your router certainly in that space, but the mid-market, is that really where you have been focusing and that's where you're seeing the most traction these days, as far as the incremental bookings, billings that are coming into the company?\nBrian Halligan: That's a good question. We roughly break our segment stand of 2 to 20-employee company we call it small, 20 to 200 employees, that's mid, 200 to 2000, we call that enterprise. We have perfect product market fit and perfect product go-to market fit in that middle 20 to 200, we do extremely well in there. I think what you've seeing this year is nice encouragement on product market fit and go-to market and non-go to market a bit in the small ME [ph] enterprise. On the small side, we did that, we repackaged basically that starter suite. So $50 per month and -- boy, that sounds really well. We're very happy with what's going on there. Customers are signing up, they have been retained nicely, they're upgrading and at the same time, we've seen a lot of improvements to our product line up in that 200 to 2,000. And so, I see at this time of this, we're per start up scale up. What I don't like to describe HubSpot as for a small business. I don't think that's really us, we're not like little tiny company, little shop. I have a flower shop near my house and they make smoothies, it's like two people, it's not for them, it's for real business that's going to grow. We want to be the number one CRM for scaling companies, so that's kind of where we fit in the market. It's a little bit similar and just based on using this analogy, but it's a little -- just a little bit similar to where NetSuite used to sit in the market. I think NetSuite's ham [ph] is a lot smaller, in the grand scheme of things than our CM [ph] but it's for that start-up and scale up company between 2 and 2,000 employees.\nStan Zlotsky: Perfect, thank you. And then if I could sneak in a quick follow-up. So, the -- help us kind of better understand how you guys are thinking about Q4 guidance because on one hand, we're very clearly seeing extremely strong results in Q3. And Brian, you talked about the tailwinds that you've been seeing through this -- through the summer and then into all the way through October, but at the same time, we are seeing COVID cases are spiking and you guys, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that is a consideration. So, how did you guys reflect that in your Q4 guide? Maybe that's a question for, Kate. Thank you.\nKathryn Bueker: Yes, I think we've been trying to take a very consistent approach for many years in terms of how we think about guidance. In the short-term, our model is pretty predictable and we're providing guidance now, just for the next three months. And so we -- well, I mean, we're a month in, so the next two months. And so to us, it's a bit of a balance just looking at business performance and then looking at potential outcomes. And we're confident in the numbers that we put forward.\nStan Zlotsky: Got it. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard from Citigroup. Please go ahead.\nDrew Foster: Hi, this is Drew Foster, and thanks for taking the questions. I have two; your Analyst Day, you highlighted some customers were a key factor in deciding to go with HubSpot was that they able to consolidate systems with you, so, to what extent is the desire to consolidate front office technology is going to reliably be a growth driver for you, Brian? And I'm wondering if you've noticed that trend in any specific demographics of customers in the common theme and whether you've drawn out any specific plays around addressing that opportunity across different combinations of your hubs and I will follow up.\nBrian Halligan: That's a really good question. There is a great suite and there has been a bunch of [indiscernible] about it, but there is an ad cut out of like a 1998 newspaper. It's an ad for Radio Shack. And in the ad, there's like 50 different devices in there from an alarm clock, to a compass, to -- you name it. And then next to it is an iPhone, and the iPhone does all that stuff now. And I think that really -- that ad is really good. And that's sort of like HubSpot. People have all this stops that they've kind of come together overtime, it doesn't weave together very well, and so we're seeing people just kind of consolidating their whole set back on HubSpot. And then plugging -- our integrations are very elegant. They're kind of like Apple's integrations. They're much tighter, and so it's a little bit similar to that. We're seeing a fair amount of that here. Particularly as we move from marketing to pull CRM platform. The platform, that's a very broad thing for managing -- from a total stranger that's never heard of you all the way to a delighted customer, people can have hundreds of applications dealing with that. And then they come to HubSpot, like, all right, here's a Hub. We'll manage this experience through HubSpot, we'll plug a few applications into it and get it to really roll. So that's kind of how we think about that. That old Radio Shack ad.\nDrew Foster: Okay, got it. And as I'm thinking about ARR growth for your newer hubs, Brian, and compare that to the growth curve of where marketing was at this time. Obviously, to the newer hubs, has had the benefit of the cross-sell vector that marketing didn't have for some period of time. So if we kind of do a qualitative exercise and back out the benefit of cross-sells for those newer hubs and observe the success of those hubs in their own -- on their own merits, what evidence or trend gives you confidence that you're sort of shaking things up in those markets the same way that you did with marketing?\nBrian Halligan: That's a -- no, it's a good question. I think back when we released our Sales Hub products, several years ago now and started the product called Signal. And, man, it's just been getting better and better and sort of got a lot better a month ago as the Sales Hub Enterprise released. And if I look at that product, like most of the early sales are really cross-sell sales. And I look at that product now, it's as much a front door to HubSpot as it is the side door from Marketing Hub, so it's a lot -- people come in on Sales Hub and then they buy Marketing Hub or if there's an existing Marketing Hub, that's when then they buy Sales Hub. That took a while to develop, but that's humming right now. It's a good-sized business, growing fast. I think we're going to see the same thing on Service Hub and the same thing on CMS Hub. Where a lot of it now is, you're selling into your existing customers, but those products are getting a lot better and I think those will become front doors over time as well.\nDrew Foster: Really helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tom Roderick from Stifel. Please go ahead.\nParker Lane: Hi, it's actually Parker Lane in for Tom, thanks for taking my question. So, Brian, you just launched marketing contacts during the quarter. I'm just wondering how much of that was in response to sort of feedback, I guess, from your customers. And what do you think that means for attention going forward if customers really don't have that upper bound on how many contacts they can store in the platform? What does that mean for attention and engagement with the platform? Thanks.\nBrian Halligan: Hey, Parker, that's a great question. We have a terrific Board member partner named Jay Simons, he was President for a long, long time. The company called it lasting, and he was admired a lot. In his last CMV, they tracked bugs in their product and they strive to fix bugs. They also track bugs in their entire go-to-market in the entire buying and using experience, including their pricing model. Whenever they find a bug that creates some friction or creates a cringe in that process, they file it and they try to fix it. We have completely borrowed that idea here at HubSpot. And one of the bugs in the buying experience for HubSpot that's been going on for a fairly long period of time, it's caused customers to cringe [ph]; it is marketing content. And you can imagine how this might happen. When we first started HubSpot, we priced it like a lot of other marketing vendors where you buy the SKU, and then the larger database and contact, the more you pay, of course, that works great. But then you add Sales Hub and all of a sudden, salespeople are adding thousands and tens of thousands of contact into that hub and the field for the marketer is going through the roof. There is a lot of complaints about this over many years. This was something we wanted to fix for a long time, it was actually a large project that took -- probably took a year to do it and we bidded up and we did it over the summer and it's come out really well. Very happy with the way we've implemented. We're getting terrific feedback from it and I think that change will increase customer happiness. And I think will also make it easier for people to buy HubSpot. It will also make it easier, more predictable to scale your pricing of HubSpot. So that's a big, big win for our customers and for HubSpot itself, and I think for investors over the long haul. And it'll be a driver for us.\nParker Lane: Yes, it's great feedback. And then on the Sales Hub front and one of the things you announced in inbound was the addition of some new tools there including CPQ. I was wondering if you could talk about the initial interest in the CPQ tools you have out there. Is that mostly enterprise play you think, or if that's really broad-based in the customer stats? Thanks again.\nBrian Halligan: Yes, we announced some early CPQ product, the Sales Hub Enterprise is getting nice uptick on them. And this is just sort of I think of HubSpot as we want to be a very legit CRM something. We want to be the number one CRM for scaling companies. And that means you kind of go all the way to the edges of the problem in. And so part of the edge is if people want to do proposal and they want to do quote and they want connect it to their accounting system and have all that stuff closed off and close the loop, and we came out with an early version of that. We've built an enterprise getting really, really good adoption. And keep your eye on that channel. There's more to come on that front. If customers really like that area that we're investing in, we're going to invest more.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Arjun Bhatia from William Blair.\nArjun Bhatia: Hi, guys, thanks. And I'll echo my congrats on the quarter. Kate, if I can start off, I know we've touched on this a little bit last quarter, but is there anything, any update that you can give us on this COVID cohort of customers that are coming in on starter in terms of upgrade rates, churn, landing point, anything on that front would be helpful now that we're 90 days from when we last had this conversation.\nKathryn Bueker : Yes. And I think the trends are very much the same as the ones that we talked about in odd day, and frankly, on the last earnings call. We continue to see those big starter cohorts. They are the vast majority of those starter cohorts are new to HubSpot versus customers that are downgrading or moving from another skew. They are on balance similar in size to the customers that we saw signing up for our other starter skews before this package was introduced. And they are upgrading at a rate that similar. I would say, maybe a little bit lower than what we had seen historically, but at a rate that's healthy enough that we're excited about the opportunity there. \nArjun Bhatia : Okay, that's very helpful. And Brian, maybe one for you not to beat a dead horse on 2021, but just curious, obviously this has been in audio, curious on what you're hearing from your customers in terms of how they're thinking about marketing budgets and how those might change next year? Do you think it was elevated focus on digitizing marketing strategy as go to market continues? Or do you think we see that moderate a little bit going into next year?\nBrian Halligan: It's hard to predict in the future is a very hard thing. I would just say and connecting with my sales leaders and service leader just over the last couple of days. People are feeling pretty good, demand is strong and customers are happy and buying more in new accounts are coming in. Feel like our products are more and more competitive. So feeling pretty good yes, feeling pretty good it's hard to know what happens if design locked down or something really bad happens with this election, but feeling pretty good. I think they are great here [ph].\nArjun Bhatia : Okay. Thank you. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Macdonald from Needham.\nRyan Macdonald: Hi, thanks for taking my question and congrats on an excellent quarter. I guess, Brian first one for you given that CMS Hub sort of fully launched sort of in the midst of the pandemic, it feels like inbound was a bit of a coming-out party for the new product, but just curious to see sort of as your processing in going through sort of the responses and feedback from inbound what you're hearing in terms of interest in adoption for CMS Hub and what sort of the mix you're seeing in terms of existing customers that may have been using the add-on functionality to Marketing Hub initially wanting to upgrade versus net new customers into the platform. \nBrian Halligan: Hey Ryan. Hearing great things about CMS hub. So it's an interesting industry, the content management system industry, and people probably -- investor talk a lot about with the GoDaddy and we're facing in the advertise a lot, but that really the dominant players in our part of the market even up from us are open-source project and they're not as well known to investors, because there is no public company comp and they don't really advertise much but we definitely compete, we are going t to compete in the mid-market with the large open source product called work-brand [ph]. I think when we really win over the long arc of this thing is there is tremendous power when you combine the content management system with that customer relationship management systems that's a one plus one equals to three experience builder for your business. And those things are combined and really cool with HubSpot. But if you watch the [indiscernible] overtime on the development environment for the content management system. The development environment in CRM come in together, it's going to be an asset. It's going to be really, really cool. So reduction on CMS is been really solid, business is growing nicely, our partners in particular are really excited about it, but over the long haul there is a collided scope of opportunities, that will be great for our customers are nearly combined with those two applications.\nRyan Macdonald: Got it, thanks. And then the follow up, obviously the environment we're things evolving pretty quickly, but any sense, are you hearing anything recently internationally with sort of over the past few weeks with Europe seemingly going back in the locked down or any impact to the business at all?\nBrian Halligan: Yes, Brian, we're asking the same thing and checked with my European leaders. It seems, all right now, it's hard to say what happens, two, three, four weeks from now, but the demand seems pretty solid over there. The execution has been really solid again to think our value prop super strong and so it's hard to predict what will happen in future but feeling pretty good right now. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Ken Wong from Guggenheim Securities. \nUnidentified Analyst : Hi this is Nancy [ph] for Ken. Thanks for taking the question. Just two questions, first on retention. Do you see a risk for that to track back down after if locked down start again or have your customers been able to figure out how to kind of work through the new normal or I guess on the flip side, is there more headroom to this number to improve as we get further out from the short-term discount?\nKathryn Bueker: Yes, I mean Q3 was a very strong retention quarter for us. So I said in the prepared remarks that I mean retention rate comfortably north of 100. I also said that absent the tailwinds that we see from customers coming off of those short term discount, we still would have been comfortably above 100. We are through the majority of those and so I think that the retention that we're seeing, we're excited about that and I would particularly note that one point that we're excited about is actually the really strong retention that we're seeing on a customer dollar retention basis. So this is sort of that gross retention number. More of our customers are sticking around with HubSpot. \nUnidentified Analyst: Great that's helpful. And just hang on to that. So have their customers that previously might have contracted seat or maybe downgraded skews have the expanded back up yet. \nKathryn Bueker: Yes. It's hard to say I think know when you look at the overall net upgrade rates that we're seeing in Q3. It is dramatically larger than what we saw in Q2, which would lead you to believe that as a whole population. Our customers are on net upgrading more.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne from Evercore ISI.\nKirk Materne: Thanks very much, Brian, what do you think about sort of just the opportunity with the Sales Hub, the Enterprise Sales Hub. I would expect that the easier land is to sort of continue to grow with your customers that might has historically grown sort of out of your technology versus going after sort of net new customers, but that might be wrong. So just kind of thinking about when you talk to your sales leaders is it about trying to go and rip and replace. Is it about expanding with existing customers already with you? I guess how are you thinking about the balance because I imagine the sales cycles are very different with those two conversations?\nBrian Halligan: Yes, there is few layers to it. I think that lowest layer on the case here, John; retaining those customers longer. We have customers that outgrow us and the reason to our grow us; things like custom project, the big reason why somebody would growth it and so, retaining them as they go from 200 to 2000 is a good one. Then just winning more deals people hesitate to buy HubSpot if they're going to really scale up, they are vary, HubSpot for scaling companies and I think the answer is yes now between what we're doing on the functionality side and what we're doing in the business model side we got the market [ph], which is much more attractive. And then maybe the third layer on that cake is ripping and replacing that's a harder thing to do. It's certainly happening and I hear about them when they happen it's exciting when will happen. But it's probably the third layer on the cake. But it's going really well. People are really excited about our customers, our partners and sales reps, it's getting us in a lot more conversation.\nKirk Materne: That's helpful. And then one sort of more maybe higher level question for you, when you talk to others in the sort of broader CRM space and maybe at the enterprise level via this concept of a customer data platform continues to come up and we've seen M&A around this. Does sort of CMS plus your marketing technology sort of solve the customer data sort of centricity discussion for you all meaning, and know why a small company when it want another customers just as well as a big company. So is that conversation coming up and do you guys, are you able to kind of get at that with your existing technology now or is that something that you're willing to partner with others on?\nBrian Halligan: People do you think of HubSpot as there, central stores all their data and over time, we wanted to get it back [ph] it is the possible to integrate all your systems in the HubSpot, take them back and forth. That's one of the reasons we acquired by [indiscernible] and then you will have them report on all that. So yes, I see HubSpot over the long haul, if you want to use the term for their customers, and I want HubSpot to be their center of gravity is what enable us to really create off experiences, whether it's on our tool or other tools that they use that they're plugging in anything from XOOM to Google AdWords too little start building itself on top of that stuff.\nKirk Materne: That's helpful. Thanks and congrats on the quarter.\nBrian Halligan: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Koji Ikeda from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nKoji Ikeda: Great, thanks for taking my questions. Congratulations on a really great quarter. First off, I wanted to thank Brian for bringing up that that Radio Shack ad picture that added my head right now. So that was just methodology. Thank you for bringing that up. I wanted to ask you about the sales Enterprise version especially work, specifically on the custom object. It sounds like it's the real game-changer for that version, I guess look at -- could you talk a little bit about what customs object means from a customer lens? Does it enables us to maybe replace any existing applications or does it enables the customer to maybe stay within the HubSpot ecosystem longer as the business scales before they have to maybe look outside the HubSpot box for additional features?\nBrian Halligan: The way I would describe it is let's just say you are University and you're using HubSpot you're just warning you call your prospective student leads impact that and when you call your students that are paying year you call them customers. Just this is unnatural. You're going jamming your business model into HubSpot pretty rigid object month. What you want to do is go to university is to match the way your whole front office system or CRM system works with the way your business works. That means you've got a student and a student is an unusual model. It's different than a typical customer because the student convenes and lasts four years. So it's custom object inside of HubSpot. You want to report on that in certain ways you want to create workloads around that in certain ways, so it just enables you to do a whole heck of a lot more. What we noticed is when a company comes in let's say there is a person company comes in, they buy HubSpot sales product marketing product and they're super happy with it because the firm starts talking about on the going to use everything they got here just plug it in and run. But as the company moves in a 500 employees now 600 employees, their business model gets complicated and they get irritated because they have the kind of jam in the HubSpot. As their business model evolves HubSpot will evolve with them and scale with them. That's sort of the way it works. That makes sense?\nKoji Ikeda: Yes, totally makes sense. Thank you for that. I wanted to just ask you one more follow-up here on the CMS Hub, you mentioned open source and word trust, but what about Drupal? Can you compete with Drupal right now whereas maybe the longer-term vision for the CMS Hub to be competitive against Drupal deployments? Thanks for taking my question.\nBrian Halligan: No problem. We're pressing Drupal both like big open source projects. They've been around a while and they're powerful products but they kind of line that in general. We took a very different approach where we're pure out of the box to do a very modern approach to building it. It's not have been my head to vision Drupal pretty far upmarket like the White House runs on Drupal. A few enterprises run on Drupal more where we live in kind of the mid-market is more WordPress and we integrate really nicely with WordPress. If somebody loves WordPress they can keep it, but I do think that power of having the CRM and having the CMS together is going to enable developers enough people to do amazing stuff over the next couple of years. So I think that's where our core competitive advantage is going to come from.\nKoji Ikeda: Got it. Thanks for taking my questions.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Siti Panigrahi from Mizuho. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey, this is our Michael on for Siti Panigrahi. Congrats on a great quarter once again. I want to dive in quickly on International. You saw a nice acceleration in the quarter. Can you point anything in particular that is driving success abroad? Moving forward, can we expect that they are now to maintain the type of strength even with the ongoing shutdown?\nKathryn Bueker: Thanks so much for the question, it's interesting that you called that out. I actually think that the performance is pretty broad-based. Yes, we saw some acceleration or reacceleration in the international growth. We also saw a reacceleration in domestic growth. So I think it's across Hubs, across geographies we saw really strong performance.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brent Bracelin from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is our Jefferies on for Brent. I was wondering in terms of the traction in the enterprise and professional our customers this quarter on the higher end sort of customer, how long were they in the funnel? I'm wondering whether these customers were looking at digital engagement products more even since the early pandemic and kind of finally converted in Q3 or are these new customers that you're engaging with in the quarter and converting in Q3 alone? Just trying to understand that there are customers out there that are kind of enduring the pain of a traditional go to market and then they have to make the change in the back half of the year.\nBrian Halligan: Honestly, it's a little bit of both. There's a lot of people who have then -- a lot of people are looking at that for a long time. Finally, bought and there is some short we caught short cycle MRR year. The short cycle MRR is up by short cycle on they came into our funnel within the month of that purchase within the month. It's not up a lot. I think it's a little bit more broad-based than -- like I kind of said earlier I think part of our momentum is certainly all the stuff going on in the world is really particular thinking about digitizing their go to market. I also just think, even with all that -- if this is that normal year. We have the night with nothing happening in the world. I think we'll be having a really good year. We are really set up well. So I think it's a little bit of both. That would be my take on it.\nOperator: That was our last question. At this time, I will turn the call over to Brian Halligan, CEO and Chairman for closing comments.\nBrian Halligan: Thanks to all of you for joining us today. Look forward to talking to you soon.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Brian Halligan",
            "content": "Thanks, Chuck. Good afternoon, folks. Thank you for joining us today. While none of us could have foreseen the difficult path this year would take, as we enter the final quarter of 2020, I'm grateful for our customers, partners and employees that have grown through it with us. Despite this challenging environment, HubSpot has grown very nicely. Demand trends have continued to strengthen in the third quarter as more companies digitized their end-to-end customer experience and built modern flywheels. Revenue growth was 32% in Q3 and non-GAAP operating margin was 7%. We had a record total customer growth of 39% year-over-year, surpassing 95,000, while multi-product adoption is also continued to grow nicely representing over 45,000 customers. These customers have also become more embedded in the HubSpot ecosystem, as we reached nearly 2 million cumulative platform integrations. The year is not over, but I believe the growth we've seen in the third quarter is both a story of digital transformation tailwind combined with excellent execution by our team's build and deliver a terrific product for our customers. A big focus for 2020 is on building a CRM platform, that couples an increasingly powerful enterprise back-end with an intuitive consumer grade in front it. This is a rare combination that software industry is unique to us in the CRM industry. That rare combination is a result of a few things. First, we hand crafted HubSpot on a set of internal primary colors reporting content, messaging, data and automation. These primary colors are combined to create our Hub which all work the same intuitive way. This is in contrast to traditional CRMs, which are coupled together through acquisition. Second, we have a large multi-year investment in user research and design that gives HubSpot that consumer-like feel. Third, our entire company is laser-focused on delighting our customers. Culturally over the last few years, we've moved from a funnel mindset to a flywheel mindset, where our growth rate is heavily influenced by the values our customers are getting from our offering. The really exciting thing that happened since we spoke last was the release of Sales Hub Enterprise which leverages these primary colors as custom objects, as proposal, as advanced sales automation, and as the economic integrations, like NetSuite, QuickBooks and Xero to our CRM. This was the huge release for our customers and partners, in particular, the addition of custom object changes the game for a lot of our customers. Custom objects was the very large investment for us that took well over a year to develop. Prior to this release, our customers had to set their business model into a relatively rigid object model. Now, our customers can set our object model around their business model. This was a big block for us with scale businesses that we've knocked down. One customer, LegalZoom, an early sales Hub Enterprise adopter, praised this intersection of power and ease we provide by saying - - we have had a 100% user adoption and we couldn't be happier. Now, it's still early days, but we had a strong start with sales of enterprise net new AOR, giving a record high in October. There is still a lot of uncertainty in the world today, so it's hard to predict the future. But one thing I'm certain of, is our approach to building products that delight customers, it's going to keep paying off. I want to thank you for your time so far today. We're proud of the momentum we've done in Q3 and remain optimistic and focused on closing out the year strong. Now, I'll hand things over to Kate to take you through our Q3 financial and operating results in more detail. I'd like to close by thanking my leadership team and all the HubSpotters out there who are listening tonight. It's been an exceptionally challenging year. You all have stepped up during these tough times, with great execution and terrific resilience. I feel lucky to be on your team. Okay, operator, let's open it up to some questions. Hey Mark, I read your report when it came out, I thought it was great. I'm not that surprised. There's been a lot of hard work that's gone in on the platform level or custom object side of things and it's been really going on for a long period of time and this was the year we really wanted to strengthen that enterprise tier of our products, the products that we sell into like 200 to 2000 level. Customers -- and we knew for customers of that size a major objection from existing customers who were graduating and new potential customers was -- gosh, we get this evolving business model, but we have to jam our business model into your relatively fixed object model, into your contacts, companies, deals. It's sort of rigid the way we structured it, and what custom object gives the ability to do is wrap HubSpot in our object model around an evolving a more complicated business model. So this makes us a better fit, for example for a university, there can be a student object, for a SaaS company, there can be a subscription object. There can be for manufacturing company, inventory could be an object, so just gives you a ton more flexibility if you're a scaling company. And so I'm not shocked that we're getting good adoption. It's a loud noise from that to your customer for us for a number of years and so we undertook that project in part of last year and it came out great. The nice thing about Sales Hub Enterprise and about the custom object is they're part and parcel of HubSpot, so they inherit all the great automation and all other great reporting, and I'm kind of bolted in there, it's sort of like an apple-like field and they are really powerful and really easy to use. So, I guess I'm not shocked. Hey, Alex. It's an interesting year, like if I think about this year, the year started really strong January and February. We were very bullish about this year internally, we've done a lot of: hard work last year to kind of get ready, so starting with the kind of the deal end of March to early June, huge headwind and in starting at the end of June, that headwind turned into a tailwind, and that tailwind blew all through Q3, it blew through October too. I'm pretty happy with where we're sitting at the moment, things are going really well and again, I think we're very well-positioned to help our customers through and get some credit for that. I also want to give some credit to a lot of hard work from the team in execution over the last couple of years to put us in this position, so it's a little bit of both. It's hard to say with the election and the shutdown, I'm not sure what's going to happen over the next 6 months.  I'm pretty optimistic, like the pipeline looks good, customers are quite happier, value prop is quite stronger, products are getting better. Customers need to move from an outbound model to an inbound model, from outside selling to inside selling, from offline to online. Our product is a really, really good fit for that type of thing. And so, I'm feeling quite positive these days actually. I don't know, is the honest answer, I don't know if the stimulus is coming and I don't know what the impact will be on HubSpot. I can say -- I really think a lot about what I can control and what I can influence. I can influence our employees and our customers and our partners and I think we're in very good shape, like you've been tracking our company for a long time, just feeling really very solid about where we sit. And I think -- really think way back, like when we first went public it seems like 100 years ago. We were just making the transition from a marketing app to a CRM platform and we're making great progress on that. It's a multi-year arc and we made huge investments, it's still pretty early in that arc, like our vision for what a modern CRM value prop is, the company's relative to what we've built. We made a lot of progress, there's a lot more progress to come. So in general, feeling quite good these days. Alex, we're getting some feedback there so we had to mute your line. Thanks for the questions. Operator, if we could take the next one. I think everybody now -- so many companies had on their to-do lists to really digitize their go-to market. There's very few people in the world today that say that's a bad idea. Ten years ago we were early starting up; people though we were crazy with all of inbound. It becomes pretty mainstream and I think COVID might have sped up the plans on there, people add vols in their prospects at home and their customers at home in all and -- works kind of a compelling event to see people up to really digitize their go-to market and HubSpot was very well-positioned for that. And we built a platform to help people digitize their entire go-to market to create new modern flywheel, to create a really terrific customer experience. I don't think it should be that surprising that we've done really well. I do think we are very well-positioned. I think we're very well-positioned going forward too, like the advances we've made on the product and the improvements we've made as the go-to-market have been substantial over the last year and I think we're getting nice returns on those. That's a good question. We roughly break our segment stand of 2 to 20-employee company we call it small, 20 to 200 employees, that's mid, 200 to 2000, we call that enterprise. We have perfect product market fit and perfect product go-to market fit in that middle 20 to 200, we do extremely well in there. I think what you've seeing this year is nice encouragement on product market fit and go-to market and non-go to market a bit in the small ME [ph] enterprise. On the small side, we did that, we repackaged basically that starter suite. So $50 per month and -- boy, that sounds really well. We're very happy with what's going on there. Customers are signing up, they have been retained nicely, they're upgrading and at the same time, we've seen a lot of improvements to our product line up in that 200 to 2,000. And so, I see at this time of this, we're per start up scale up. What I don't like to describe HubSpot as for a small business. I don't think that's really us, we're not like little tiny company, little shop. I have a flower shop near my house and they make smoothies, it's like two people, it's not for them, it's for real business that's going to grow. We want to be the number one CRM for scaling companies, so that's kind of where we fit in the market. It's a little bit similar and just based on using this analogy, but it's a little -- just a little bit similar to where NetSuite used to sit in the market. I think NetSuite's ham [ph] is a lot smaller, in the grand scheme of things than our CM [ph] but it's for that start-up and scale up company between 2 and 2,000 employees. That's a really good question. There is a great suite and there has been a bunch of [indiscernible] about it, but there is an ad cut out of like a 1998 newspaper. It's an ad for Radio Shack. And in the ad, there's like 50 different devices in there from an alarm clock, to a compass, to -- you name it. And then next to it is an iPhone, and the iPhone does all that stuff now. And I think that really -- that ad is really good. And that's sort of like HubSpot. People have all this stops that they've kind of come together overtime, it doesn't weave together very well, and so we're seeing people just kind of consolidating their whole set back on HubSpot. And then plugging -- our integrations are very elegant. They're kind of like Apple's integrations. They're much tighter, and so it's a little bit similar to that. We're seeing a fair amount of that here. Particularly as we move from marketing to pull CRM platform. The platform, that's a very broad thing for managing -- from a total stranger that's never heard of you all the way to a delighted customer, people can have hundreds of applications dealing with that. And then they come to HubSpot, like, all right, here's a Hub. We'll manage this experience through HubSpot, we'll plug a few applications into it and get it to really roll. So that's kind of how we think about that. That old Radio Shack ad. That's a -- no, it's a good question. I think back when we released our Sales Hub products, several years ago now and started the product called Signal. And, man, it's just been getting better and better and sort of got a lot better a month ago as the Sales Hub Enterprise released. And if I look at that product, like most of the early sales are really cross-sell sales. And I look at that product now, it's as much a front door to HubSpot as it is the side door from Marketing Hub, so it's a lot -- people come in on Sales Hub and then they buy Marketing Hub or if there's an existing Marketing Hub, that's when then they buy Sales Hub. That took a while to develop, but that's humming right now. It's a good-sized business, growing fast. I think we're going to see the same thing on Service Hub and the same thing on CMS Hub. Where a lot of it now is, you're selling into your existing customers, but those products are getting a lot better and I think those will become front doors over time as well. Hey, Parker, that's a great question. We have a terrific Board member partner named Jay Simons, he was President for a long, long time. The company called it lasting, and he was admired a lot. In his last CMV, they tracked bugs in their product and they strive to fix bugs. They also track bugs in their entire go-to-market in the entire buying and using experience, including their pricing model. Whenever they find a bug that creates some friction or creates a cringe in that process, they file it and they try to fix it. We have completely borrowed that idea here at HubSpot. And one of the bugs in the buying experience for HubSpot that's been going on for a fairly long period of time, it's caused customers to cringe [ph]; it is marketing content. And you can imagine how this might happen. When we first started HubSpot, we priced it like a lot of other marketing vendors where you buy the SKU, and then the larger database and contact, the more you pay, of course, that works great. But then you add Sales Hub and all of a sudden, salespeople are adding thousands and tens of thousands of contact into that hub and the field for the marketer is going through the roof. There is a lot of complaints about this over many years. This was something we wanted to fix for a long time, it was actually a large project that took -- probably took a year to do it and we bidded up and we did it over the summer and it's come out really well. Very happy with the way we've implemented. We're getting terrific feedback from it and I think that change will increase customer happiness. And I think will also make it easier for people to buy HubSpot. It will also make it easier, more predictable to scale your pricing of HubSpot. So that's a big, big win for our customers and for HubSpot itself, and I think for investors over the long haul. And it'll be a driver for us. Yes, we announced some early CPQ product, the Sales Hub Enterprise is getting nice uptick on them. And this is just sort of I think of HubSpot as we want to be a very legit CRM something. We want to be the number one CRM for scaling companies. And that means you kind of go all the way to the edges of the problem in. And so part of the edge is if people want to do proposal and they want to do quote and they want connect it to their accounting system and have all that stuff closed off and close the loop, and we came out with an early version of that. We've built an enterprise getting really, really good adoption. And keep your eye on that channel. There's more to come on that front. If customers really like that area that we're investing in, we're going to invest more. It's hard to predict in the future is a very hard thing. I would just say and connecting with my sales leaders and service leader just over the last couple of days. People are feeling pretty good, demand is strong and customers are happy and buying more in new accounts are coming in. Feel like our products are more and more competitive. So feeling pretty good yes, feeling pretty good it's hard to know what happens if design locked down or something really bad happens with this election, but feeling pretty good. I think they are great here [ph]. Hey Ryan. Hearing great things about CMS hub. So it's an interesting industry, the content management system industry, and people probably -- investor talk a lot about with the GoDaddy and we're facing in the advertise a lot, but that really the dominant players in our part of the market even up from us are open-source project and they're not as well known to investors, because there is no public company comp and they don't really advertise much but we definitely compete, we are going t to compete in the mid-market with the large open source product called work-brand [ph]. I think when we really win over the long arc of this thing is there is tremendous power when you combine the content management system with that customer relationship management systems that's a one plus one equals to three experience builder for your business. And those things are combined and really cool with HubSpot. But if you watch the [indiscernible] overtime on the development environment for the content management system. The development environment in CRM come in together, it's going to be an asset. It's going to be really, really cool. So reduction on CMS is been really solid, business is growing nicely, our partners in particular are really excited about it, but over the long haul there is a collided scope of opportunities, that will be great for our customers are nearly combined with those two applications. Yes, Brian, we're asking the same thing and checked with my European leaders. It seems, all right now, it's hard to say what happens, two, three, four weeks from now, but the demand seems pretty solid over there. The execution has been really solid again to think our value prop super strong and so it's hard to predict what will happen in future but feeling pretty good right now. Yes, there is few layers to it. I think that lowest layer on the case here, John; retaining those customers longer. We have customers that outgrow us and the reason to our grow us; things like custom project, the big reason why somebody would growth it and so, retaining them as they go from 200 to 2000 is a good one. Then just winning more deals people hesitate to buy HubSpot if they're going to really scale up, they are vary, HubSpot for scaling companies and I think the answer is yes now between what we're doing on the functionality side and what we're doing in the business model side we got the market [ph], which is much more attractive. And then maybe the third layer on that cake is ripping and replacing that's a harder thing to do. It's certainly happening and I hear about them when they happen it's exciting when will happen. But it's probably the third layer on the cake. But it's going really well. People are really excited about our customers, our partners and sales reps, it's getting us in a lot more conversation. People do you think of HubSpot as there, central stores all their data and over time, we wanted to get it back [ph] it is the possible to integrate all your systems in the HubSpot, take them back and forth. That's one of the reasons we acquired by [indiscernible] and then you will have them report on all that. So yes, I see HubSpot over the long haul, if you want to use the term for their customers, and I want HubSpot to be their center of gravity is what enable us to really create off experiences, whether it's on our tool or other tools that they use that they're plugging in anything from XOOM to Google AdWords too little start building itself on top of that stuff. Thank you. The way I would describe it is let's just say you are University and you're using HubSpot you're just warning you call your prospective student leads impact that and when you call your students that are paying year you call them customers. Just this is unnatural. You're going jamming your business model into HubSpot pretty rigid object month. What you want to do is go to university is to match the way your whole front office system or CRM system works with the way your business works. That means you've got a student and a student is an unusual model. It's different than a typical customer because the student convenes and lasts four years. So it's custom object inside of HubSpot. You want to report on that in certain ways you want to create workloads around that in certain ways, so it just enables you to do a whole heck of a lot more. What we noticed is when a company comes in let's say there is a person company comes in, they buy HubSpot sales product marketing product and they're super happy with it because the firm starts talking about on the going to use everything they got here just plug it in and run. But as the company moves in a 500 employees now 600 employees, their business model gets complicated and they get irritated because they have the kind of jam in the HubSpot. As their business model evolves HubSpot will evolve with them and scale with them. That's sort of the way it works. That makes sense? No problem. We're pressing Drupal both like big open source projects. They've been around a while and they're powerful products but they kind of line that in general. We took a very different approach where we're pure out of the box to do a very modern approach to building it. It's not have been my head to vision Drupal pretty far upmarket like the White House runs on Drupal. A few enterprises run on Drupal more where we live in kind of the mid-market is more WordPress and we integrate really nicely with WordPress. If somebody loves WordPress they can keep it, but I do think that power of having the CRM and having the CMS together is going to enable developers enough people to do amazing stuff over the next couple of years. So I think that's where our core competitive advantage is going to come from. Honestly, it's a little bit of both. There's a lot of people who have then -- a lot of people are looking at that for a long time. Finally, bought and there is some short we caught short cycle MRR year. The short cycle MRR is up by short cycle on they came into our funnel within the month of that purchase within the month. It's not up a lot. I think it's a little bit more broad-based than -- like I kind of said earlier I think part of our momentum is certainly all the stuff going on in the world is really particular thinking about digitizing their go to market. I also just think, even with all that -- if this is that normal year. We have the night with nothing happening in the world. I think we'll be having a really good year. We are really set up well. So I think it's a little bit of both. That would be my take on it. Thanks to all of you for joining us today. Look forward to talking to you soon."

            "content": "Thanks, Brian. Let's turn to our third quarter financial results and our guidance for the fourth quarter and full year 2020. Third quarter revenue growth re-accelerated to 30% year-over-year in constant currency and 32% as reported. Q3 subscription revenue grew 32% year-over-year, while services revenue increased 12% year-over-year on an as-reported basis. Domestic revenue grew 20% in Q3, while international revenue growth was 39% year-over-year in constant currency and 40% as reported. International revenue represented 44% of total revenue in Q3, up 3 points year-over-year. Deferred revenue as of the end of September was $259 million, a 27% increase year-over-year. Calculated billings were $246 million in Q3, up 33% in constant currency and 38% year-over-year on an as-reported basis. Earlier in the year, we introduced proactive measures to provide customers and partners the flexibility needed to remain productive and engaged parts of the HubSpot's ecosystem. As I shared at the Analyst Day, we saw the vast majority of these COVID customer relief requests in the first half of the year. Overall, we continue to see a small number of new requests and the retention of our customers at the end of the short-term plays remains strong. We continue to watch these trends carefully, particularly given the recent uptick in global COVID cases. We also saw continued strength in demand from new customers during the quarter. We ended Q3 with over 95,000 total customers, up 39% year-over-year. Net customer additions were nearly 9,000 and set another company record, driven by broad strength across the business, although we continue to see notable growth in our starter growth suite customers. Average subscription revenue per customer of roughly $9,700 was up a few points sequentially, but down year-over-year, as a result of the strength that we've seen at the low end of the portfolio. Total revenue retention was greater than 100% in Q3. While retention benefited from the performance of customers upgrading at the end of short-term discount, revenue retention would have remained above 100% without this benefit. The remainder of my comments will refer to non-GAAP measures. Third quarter gross margin was 82%, flat year-over-year. Subscription gross margin was 86% while services gross margin was negative 20%. Third quarter operating margin was 7%, up 1.0 compared to the same period last year. Operating margin in the quarter exceeded our expectations, primarily as a result of strong revenue performance. At the end of the third quarter, we had nearly 4,000 employees, up 20% year-over-year. Net income in the third quarter was $40 million or $0.28 per diluted share. CapEx, including capitalized software development costs, was $30 million or 6% of revenue in the quarter. We expect CapEx, as a percentage of revenue, to be 6% to 7% in 2020. Free cash flow in the third quarter was $25 million, driven by strong business performance. As a result we're increasing our expectations for full year 2020 free cash flow to approximately $60 million. HubSpot ended the quarter with $1.2 billion of cash and marketable securities. We remain confident that our strong balance sheet will provide us with the financial flexibility to invest for the long term. And with that let's dive into guidance for the fourth quarter and full year of 2020. For the fourth quarter, total revenue is expected to be in the range of $235 million to $237 million dollars, up 27% year-over-year at the midpoint. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be between $13 million and $15 million. Non-GAAP diluted net income per share is expected to be between 21% and 23%. This assumes 49.6 million fully diluted shares outstanding and for the full year of 2020 total revenue is expected to be in the range of $866 million to $868 million, up 28% year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $63.5 million and $65.5 million. Non-GAAP diluted net income per share is expected to be between $1.13 and $1.15. This assumes 48.7 million fully diluted shares outstanding. As you adjust your models, keep in mind the following. At current spot rates, we expect a 2 point FX tailwind to Q4 reported revenue and now expect a neutral FX impact to reported revenue for the full year of 2020. We have delivered modest operating margin leverage in 2020 as a result of our strong business performance, coupled with some cost savings from our shift to remote work. At our Analyst Day, I reiterated our commitment to investing for the long term and indicated that we expect to increase our R&D spending as a percentage of revenue. As a result of this increase, coupled with a return to a more normal level of employee spend over the next year, we do not expect to deliver operating margin leverage in 2021. We are still early in our planning process, so we will share a more detailed outlook for profitability when we report our Q4 results. The investments we're making in both our product and go-to-market teams are paying off and will position us well to grow in 2021 and beyond. And with that, I'll hand the call back over to Brian for his closing remarks. I think you're going to see enhancing of the flows across the Marketing Hub and the Sales Hub over time. I think they're both great engines for the company and I think they're both going to be big growth drivers to come. I guess last time we talked about a compression and the upfront duration of billings. I think we have a different conversation to have this quarter. I would to start frankly with the reminder that the FX is different on billings than it is on revenue. And so, there was a 5 point benefit to billings in Q3. So the number I would really focus on is that constant currency billings growth of 33% and there is a couple of things I would point out. One is, strong business performance is going to drive strong revenue growth and strong billings growth, but quarter-over-quarter, we did see an improvement to the billing duration and some of that is a mix where we saw some strengths in Marketing Hub and the Pro and Enterprise skews, but we also saw a bit of a tailwind just like we saw with to retention to the return to normal billing or some of the customers that we're under these short-term COVID discounts as they came out the other side. I would advise just long-term the great anchor point really still is constant currency revenue and constant currency billing tracking. Thanks for the question. We are obviously really happy with the new customer adds for the quarter. I would say starter growth suite was another quarter of really strong adds and so that was a big driver of the customer count growth in Q3. But one of the things that I liked about the quarter was that we also had really strong adds in the Professional and Enterprise additions and frankly, both in Marketing and in Sales. I would caution us not to expect 8,000 or 9,000 new customers every quarter, but it was a great quarter for new customer add. As far as ASRPC, some of the sequential uptick is going to be attributed exactly as you expected to a bit more in the Professional and Enterprise customer adds. I think there is also a little bit of help there from the customer coming off of the short-term discounts and going back to more normal pricing. I would just finish, we talked about how we're expecting the ASRPC was going to be under pressure for the next few quarters at least, as the customer mix shifts to that starter tier. I think that still holds true. Yes, I think we've been trying to take a very consistent approach for many years in terms of how we think about guidance. In the short-term, our model is pretty predictable and we're providing guidance now, just for the next three months. And so we -- well, I mean, we're a month in, so the next two months. And so to us, it's a bit of a balance just looking at business performance and then looking at potential outcomes. And we're confident in the numbers that we put forward. Yes. And I think the trends are very much the same as the ones that we talked about in odd day, and frankly, on the last earnings call. We continue to see those big starter cohorts. They are the vast majority of those starter cohorts are new to HubSpot versus customers that are downgrading or moving from another skew. They are on balance similar in size to the customers that we saw signing up for our other starter skews before this package was introduced. And they are upgrading at a rate that similar. I would say, maybe a little bit lower than what we had seen historically, but at a rate that's healthy enough that we're excited about the opportunity there. Yes, I mean Q3 was a very strong retention quarter for us. So I said in the prepared remarks that I mean retention rate comfortably north of 100. I also said that absent the tailwinds that we see from customers coming off of those short term discount, we still would have been comfortably above 100. We are through the majority of those and so I think that the retention that we're seeing, we're excited about that and I would particularly note that one point that we're excited about is actually the really strong retention that we're seeing on a customer dollar retention basis. So this is sort of that gross retention number. More of our customers are sticking around with HubSpot. Yes. It's hard to say I think know when you look at the overall net upgrade rates that we're seeing in Q3. It is dramatically larger than what we saw in Q2, which would lead you to believe that as a whole population. Our customers are on net upgrading more. Thanks so much for the question, it's interesting that you called that out. I actually think that the performance is pretty broad-based. Yes, we saw some acceleration or reacceleration in the international growth. We also saw a reacceleration in domestic growth. So I think it's across Hubs, across geographies we saw really strong performance."

The GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to each non-GAAP financial measure used or discussed, and a reconciliation of the differences between such measures, can be found within our second quarter 2020 earnings press release in the Investor Relations section of our Web site. Now, it\u2019s my pleasure to turn over the call to HubSpot's CEO and Chairman, Brian Halligan.\nBrian Halligan: Thanks, Chuck. Good afternoon, folks. Thank you for joining us today. The world\u2019s been through a lot in the last few months. Collectively, we\u2019re still weathering the storm and I\u2019m happy to share progress HubSpot's made over the last quarter. Constant currency revenue growth was 26% in Q2 and non-GAAP operating margin was 9%. Total customers grew 34% year-over-year surpassing 86,000 while multi-product adoption continuing to grow nicely, representing over 38,000 customers. We were fortunate back in Q1 to have some wind in our backs after a strong start to the year. Nevertheless, the onslaught of the global pandemic was felt throughout our company and our customer base and much of our spring was focused on helping our customers and partners respond to the economic downturn. Today, I\u2019m thankful to say that the disruptive headwinds we faced early in Q2 has eased and might have even begun to shift a bit in our favor, helped along by some nice execution in some important plays we ran. We\u2019ve had a strong product year so far that\u2019s raised the power of our enterprise tier while also adding new products to the mix. This began in Q1 with the introduction of an entirely updated version of Marketing Hub Enterprise. With this relaunch came a ton of advanced features, including revenue attribution reporting, AI-powered A/B testing and account-based marketing. Marketers can now start with us at an early stage and grow with us into a large scale now that we\u2019ve released this product. Marketing Hub Enterprise is really resonating nicely for us in the market. In Q2, we introduced a new product line, CMS Hub. This is the completely re-imagined version of our previous CMS Add-on with advanced features making up of Pro and Enterprise tier. We have found strong product market fit in the midmarket between simple but limited Web site products in overly complex content management systems. CMS Hub gives companies the benefit of advanced features like dynamic content, adaptive testing and 24/7 security monitoring, with not all that heavy maintenance and design needs that comes with legacy content management system solutions. Companies and organizations like ClassPass, World Wildlife Fund and Randstad have not built sites on the new CMS Hub. The formulization of our CMS Hub through the addition of these tiers led to a really nice reacceleration in growth in our product line. You see, the traditional enterprise SaaS playbook is to cobble together a product through acquisitions. This approach has led to a pretty rough enterprise frontend for a lot of products married to a pretty solid enterprise backend. HubSpot has skewed that traditional approach. We\u2019ve chosen instead to handcraft our product in-house. You see, underneath HubSpot, there\u2019s only one view of that customer and a consistent user experience across that frontend. We\u2019ve married a consumer-like frontend with new enterprise power and this is giving us a real advantage in the marketplace. I think our patient approach and our slight obsession with Apple is starting to really pay off. Now, we haven\u2019t just been working on that Enterprise tier. To help more businesses make the transition from offline to online after the crisis hit, we reduced the first year price of our Starter Growth Suite by more 50% and increased email send in call limit. Additionally, we released greater editing controls of our ad campaigns across Google, Facebook and LinkedIn marketing starter. All of this resulted in a 400% plus increase in our starter and install base growth as free users upgraded and many new businesses moved fully online for the first time. We coupled this on ramp to HubSpot with a surge in educational content and we\u2019ve seen record engagement in HubSpot Academy as a result. In fact, in Q2 we saw nearly 150% increase year-over-year in Academy sign ups and similarly strong growth on the number of people getting certified on HubSpot, really great stuff. I\u2019m incredibly proud of the way the entire HubSpot team continued to deliver on our product roadmap embedded to help our customers amid rapidly changing times. Companies in nearly every industry have had to move their teams, their go-to market strategies and the entire customer experience online. What might have been a gradual digital transformation for some businesses has now been dramatically accelerated by the impact of the pandemic and we\u2019ve become the platform to support that transformation in the midmarket. I\u2019m encouraged by the transaction we saw in the second quarter and we see evidence of a continuation of that performance in the early part of Q3. But this short-term demand environment is still quite fluid, so we\u2019re watching things very closely. Now, I\u2019ll hand things over to Kate to take you through our Q2 financial and operating results in more detail.\nKathryn Bueker: Thanks, Brian. Let\u2019s turn to our second quarter financial results and our guidance for the third quarter and full year 2020. Second quarter revenue grew 26% year-over-year in constant currency and 25% as reported. Q2 subscription revenue grew 26% year-over-year while services revenue declined 3% year-over-year on an as reported basis. Domestic revenue grew 20% in Q2 while international revenue growth was 36% year-over-year in constant currency and 32% as reported. International revenue represented 42% of total revenue in Q2, up 2 points year-over-year. Deferred revenue as of the end of June was $241 million, a 22% increase year-over-year. Calculated billings was $202 million, up 21% year-over-year both on an as reported basis and in constant currency. HubSpot ended the second quarter with over 86,000 total customers, which was up 34% year-over-year. Net customer additions exceeded 7,800 and set a company record, driven by strong demand across our entire product portfolio but particularly in our Starter Growth Suite. Average subscription revenue per customer of nearly $9,500 was down both sequentially and year-over-year as a result of the strength we've seen at the low end of the portfolio combined with elevated levels of customer downgrades. As we highlighted last quarter, we took some proactive measures in late March to help alleviate the impact of COVID-19 for our customers and partners. These included offering flexible payment terms and customer friendly downgrade alternatives to our most impacted customers and prepaying some partner commissions. As a result, we expected retention rates to trend lower in Q2 due to the weaker economic environment as well as the impact from our customer friendly programs. While we did in fact see pressure on our retention rates in Q2, we maintained a net revenue retention rate of 90% with the majority of the decline continuing to come from customer downgrades. It's still quite early, but we have seen encouraging performance from the first cohorts of customers coming off these short-term discounts and moving back to more normal pricing. I want to stress that the near-term economic environment is still uncertain, but we\u2019re cautiously optimistic that the plays we\u2019ve put in place helped our customers and partners adapt in these difficult times. The remainder of my comments will refer to non-GAAP measures. Second quarter gross margin was 82%, flat year-over-year. Subscription gross margin was 86% while services gross margin was negative 8%. Second quarter operating margin was 9%, up slightly compared to the same period last year. Operating margins in the quarter exceeded our expectations as a result of strong revenue performance as well as reduced travel and other discretionary expenses related to our shift to work from home. While we plan to maintain a disciplined approach to investment through the remainder of 2020, we expect our planned return to work initiative and continued investment in R&D to largely offset these expense savings. At the end of the second quarter, we had 3,769 employees, up 29% year-over-year. We expect total headcount growth to moderate in the second half of the year as we start to compare against our strong hiring quarters from 2019. Net income in the second quarter was $17 million or $0.34 per diluted share. CapEx, including capitalized software development costs, was $14 million or 7% of revenue in the quarter. We continue to expect CapEx as a percentage of revenue to be about 7% in 2020. Free cash flow in the second quarter was $800,000 driven by strong business performance and better than expected customer cash inflows. As a result, we are increasing our expectations for full year 2020 free cash flow to approximately $40 million. HubSpot ended the quarter with $1.2 billion of cash and marketable securities. At the beginning of June, we successfully executed a $460 million convertible bond issuance with the concurrent repurchase of roughly 70% of our existing convertible bond due in 2022. As we look to the future, we remain confident that our strong balance sheet will provide us with the financial flexibility to invest for the long term. And with that, let's dive into guidance for the third quarter and full year of 2020. For the third quarter, total revenue is expected to be in the range of $210 million to $211 million, up 21% year-over-year at the midpoint. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be between $7.5 million and $8.5 million. This range includes a 1 point headwind to operating margins from our INBOUND event in September.  Non-GAAP diluted net income per share is expected to be between $0.11 and $0.13. This assumes 48.8 million fully diluted shares outstanding. And for the full year of 2020, total revenue is now expected to be in a range of $828 million to $832 million, up 23% year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating income is now expected to be in the range of $52 million to $54 million. Non-GAAP diluted net income per share is now expected to be between $0.92 and $0.96. This assumes 48.5 million fully diluted shares outstanding. Our guidance reflects a view of the business that we are comfortable with today given the current economic environment, and also factors in heightened future uncertainty caused by the pandemic. As you adjust your models, keep in mind the following. As a result of the recent weakening of the U.S. dollar, we have seen a meaningful reduction in the headwinds related to foreign currency for the remainder of the year. At current spot rates, we now expect a 1 point FX tailwind to Q3 reported revenue and a neutral FX impact to reported revenue for the full year 2020. In Q2, we elected to begin tax affecting our non-GAAP net income which we believe better aligns with SEC guidance. Our updated non-GAAP EPS guidance for Q3 and the full year of 2020 includes the impact of this change. Importantly, this change does not impact our historical reported GAAP financials. Please refer to the table included in our press release for the historical impact to prior period non-GAAP earnings. In Q2, we excluded the accounting impact of our convertible debt repurchase from our non-GAAP net income and free cash flow. Please refer to the non-GAAP net income and free cash flow reconciliation tables included in our press release for more information. And with that, I'll hand the call over to Brian for his closing remarks.\nBrian Halligan: The story of 2020 has thus far been one of adversity. As a society, we faced the public health crisis and economic crisis and a crisis of conscience. When the dust settles, the world will be changed. We\u2019re trying to lean into the future ourselves and help pull our customers and partners with us. On the conscience side of that equation, at HubSpot we\u2019ve been working to advance diversity inclusion and belonging in our culture representation. We have a long way to go, so it\u2019s become one of our top strategic priorities. It\u2019s also become important for me personally to learn, evolve and speak out against racial injustice in the ways that I can. My hope is that what started as a story of adversity this year will become one of resilience and resilience relies on diversity. Thank you for your time. I look forward to seeing many of you again at our first-ever virtual Analyst Day as part of INBOUND 20 on September 22. We re-imagined the Analyst Day this year in more ways than one, so I\u2019ll see you all there. Okay, operator, let\u2019s open it up to some questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Stan Zlotsky from Morgan Stanley.\nStan Zlotsky: Perfect. Thank you so much, guys. And hope everybody is staying well and congratulations on a very strong quarter. Maybe the thing that really stood out to me was the strength of the starter package that you guys reported in the quarter and had the contributions to the overall customer growth in the quarter. As you look across and maybe try to slice and dice that strength there, any similarities within the customers that are adopting this starter package in the current environment? And then I have a quick follow up.\nBrian Halligan: Hi, Stan. Thanks for the question and hope you\u2019re well. That\u2019s something we\u2019re actually watching relatively closely. Kate and I were just talking about that. We\u2019ve been, I would say, presently surprised with that Starter Suite adoption. Just to refresh everyone on the call\u2019s memory [ph], we lowered the price in starter suite to get the marketing, sales and service product altogether by 66%, so it\u2019s $50 a month now in the first 12 months. And we did that right when COVID started and it worked. There\u2019s been really nice adoption of it and you can see that with lots of new starter suite customers in that 1,700 net new customers\u2019 number. So we\u2019re really happy with it and we\u2019re watching those cohorts super carefully. We\u2019re looking at the quality of those cohorts, like what is the size and makeup of the company who\u2019s buying it? What is the retention rate calculation on those cohorts and what\u2019s the upgrade rate? And so far so good. They look pretty good. They are similar sized companies that were buying Starter Suite before. The retention rates look pretty good. So we\u2019re going to keep that first year of $50 for now and see if we can use that as a gross lever going forward. We\u2019re pretty happy with it.\nStan Zlotsky: Perfect. And then maybe just one more. The geographic growth; U.S. slowed to 20%, international very strong at 36% constant currency. When you look across the various geographies, is it fair to say that U.S. seems to be the most impacted with all of the downgrades and international seems to be hanging in better? Any kind of qualitative commentary as far as where you\u2019re seeing the pockets of opportunity as well as strength in the various geographies? That\u2019s it from me. Thank you.\nBrian Halligan: Okay. I guess at a high level, the international business is going really well and I think that\u2019s because we\u2019ve made some big investments over the last five years and we\u2019re starting to get a return on those investments, like big investment in offices. In Europe, we have a large office in Dublin now. We have Paris, we have Berlin. We\u2019ve got offices in Japan, in Singapore, in Sydney and even one in Latin America now. So those are big investments we\u2019ve invested heavily in translating not just our products into different languages but the whole customer experience in different languages. We\u2019re getting nice return on that. I think another reason international is doing so well is just unit economics are really good. We\u2019re growing fast and cost to acquire customer relative to total lifetime value [indiscernible], so we\u2019re hiring a little faster there. I guess in terms of North America, I\u2019ve continued to be bullish about it. It\u2019s a huge market. We\u2019ve got great product market that tons and tons of happy customers, a good word of mouth. The sales organization in North America is mature. I think we\u2019re set up well for steady strong growth in North America for several years to come here and I feel good about it.\nKathryn Bueker: Stan, I would just add to Brian\u2019s comments. If you look \u2013 the overall revenue growth decelerated from Q1 to Q2. And if you look at U.S. and international, what you saw in sort of the more mature, more developed markets is a very similar level of deceleration across those markets. Where we saw a bit of an outsized impact was really on some of the more emerging markets.\nStan Zlotsky: Got it. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Christopher Merwin from Goldman Sachs.\nChristopher Merwin: Thanks very much for taking my questions. I wanted to ask about CMS Hub. I think you talked about it in the prepared remarks. But in particular where you\u2019re seeing success there, is that helping to onboard some brand new customers? Are you seeing some early success there with cross selling that to the existing base? Just curious any other color you could share about that product. Thank you.\nBrian Halligan: Thank you for the question. I guess it\u2019s a little of both. I\u2019m very excited about that new hub. It\u2019s a funny industry. The industry \u2013 down on the bottom of the industry, you\u2019ve got like really strong SaaS players like Wix and there\u2019s a company called Squarespace that\u2019s private that\u2019s doing really well down there in their SaaS product. But most of the market is buying kind of open source, client server technology. And it\u2019s funny that way. And so we feel like there\u2019s a big opportunity to build a true SaaS product and all those benefits of the SaaS product. We think we have a great advantage in this market because we\u2019ve built that CMS from scratch and we\u2019ve built our CRM from scratch and it\u2019s 1 plus 1 equals 10 when you combine those two products together with the same user interface and you\u2019re just able to create a great experience for your customers to use them together. So I feel really good about it. We\u2019re getting lots of new accounts through it and we\u2019re getting some upsell through it. We couldn\u2019t have launched it in a worse time. We launched it in April. But despite having terrible timing on launching it, it\u2019s done really, really well and I think that\u2019s going to be a big help for us, kind of like --\nChristopher Merwin: Okay, great. And maybe just one quick follow up on billings; a very solid number there, a little bit slower than the revenue growth. And Kate I think you called out some churn which you had spoke to last quarter. So can you just give us a sense of magnitude there just in terms of what you saw? And I imagine it was in line or even better than your expectations given the outperformance in the quarter?\nKathryn Bueker: Yes, sure thing. So Q2 billings came in probably a little bit better than what we had thought or hoped for. Most of that frankly is just driven by solid performance on the new business side. But one of the things that we talked about last quarter was that we also expected that we would see a decrease in billing term during the sort of period of economic turbulence. And we saw a little bit better performance on that regard in Q2. We continue to expect to see in our customer base some duration compression over time and that will cause billings growth to be a little bit shy of revenue growth at constant currency.\nChristopher Merwin: Perfect. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Arjun Bhatia from William Blair.\nArjun Bhatia: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Brian, you talked about the partner channel and the agencies that you\u2019ve worked with to kind of prepay some of the commissions. Just curious if you\u2019ve seen kind of any change in how the partner channel contribution has been holding up over the past 90 days and how much \u2013 what the strength is of those partners after you had worked with them to keep them floating [ph] and keep their business going?\nBrian Halligan: Sure. Just to refresh everyone\u2019s memory on the call. When things first started hitting in kind of mid-March, one of several things we ran was to advance six months of commissions to our partners and I think that went over really well. I think that worked for us and worked for them. They were able to kind of stabilize their business. I think it prevented layoffs in a lot of cases, so I\u2019m feeling very good about that call. And I think our partners are generally weathering the storm quite well. If I look at the numbers through Q2 and even through July, they looked pretty solid and stable. I don\u2019t see any big red flags. They seem to be weathering. I think some are doing a lot better than others, some are feeling more headwinds and some tailwinds but generally feeling pretty good about that market channel right now.\nArjun Bhatia: Perfect. Thank you. And --\nCharles MacGlashing: Arjun, just from a percentage of revenue perspective, it ticked up a little bit in the quarter. It was 42%, 43% of revenue.\nArjun Bhatia: Perfect. Thanks, Chuck. Kate, a quick follow up for you. You did raise your full year kind of revenue guidance pretty meaningfully above and beyond the beat in the current quarter. Can you maybe just talk about what you\u2019re seeing in the back half of the year that gives you a little bit more confidence in how the next two quarters will play out?\nKathryn Bueker: Yes. I guess I would just start by saying that we approached guidance with the same sort of foundational framework that we\u2019ve always approached guidance. Our model is quite predictable, particularly as it relates to sort of short term. Much like we did last quarter, we sort of recognized that there is more forward-looking uncertainty and we ran a bit of a broader set of scenarios to look at the second half of the year and to try to understand sort of upside and downside outcomes. And frankly we feel really confident about the numbers we\u2019re putting forward.\nArjun Bhatia: Great. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you very much and congrats on the quarter.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Ryan MacDonald from Needham & Company.\nRyan MacDonald: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. First up, Brian, as we\u2019ve kind of gone through the impact of the pandemic here, have you found sort of pockets or verticals where you were surprised that maybe demand \u2013 you saw increased demand that you didn\u2019t see sort of pre-COVID at all?\nBrian Halligan: Not really. The thing about that\u2019s kind of interesting is there\u2019s some industries that have just been decimated and it\u2019s brutal on a couple of industries. We just didn\u2019t have a lot of concentration in some of those industries, like restaurants and hospitality and travel. Those are pretty small for us. We\u2019ve got a heavy concentration in B2B. The other side of that is people call us SMB software. We\u2019re more M than S, like more than two-thirds of our revenue comes from companies that are over 25 employees. So we\u2019re a little bit like NetSuite is for the back office and HubSpot is to the front office. So we were definitely impacted. We felt a strong headwind as demand was soft like a marshmallow in Q2, but feel a lot better about things in June and July.\nRyan MacDonald: Excellent. And then just a quick follow up. You mentioned last quarter that multi-product customers you were seeing a bit better retention there than with single-product. Can you just talk about how that trended during second quarter and if you\u2019re seeing any improvements or maybe some deterioration there at all? Thank you.\nKathryn Bueker: Yes, sure. Multi-product customers do tend to retain better than single-product customers and we continue to see that in the quarter. That has not changed.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Brian Peterson from Raymond James.\nBrian Peterson: Hi, everyone. I hope everyone\u2019s well and congrats on a good quarter. So, Brian, as we think about the pace of product innovation and we kind of look back at Mainsail, obviously you had CMS Hub come out this year. I\u2019m curious how we should think about the hubs being added to the platform over time, what that cadence should look like?\nBrian Halligan: Well, we\u2019re certainly not done with hubs, I can tell you that. I guess if I just sort of take a step back and think about HubSpot and kind of what\u2019s going on inside of HubSpot is a year ago when we were on this call, we talked a bunch about taking a step or two back so that we could go three or four steps fast here. We were super patient about that. And that\u2019s paying off for us now. And you could kind of see it with us in January and February, we get off to just a killer start to the year. We\u2019ve announced that Marketing Hub Enterprise product did really well and we\u2019re starting to get a real return on it. The other thing around patience for us, we get a different approach to building our company and our product. If you look across enterprise software in the CRM industry, there\u2019s lots of companies in enterprise CRM. They\u2019re more like private equity companies with giant sales forces attached to them than they are like true software companies. They cobble their solutions together with M&A. We kind of handcrafted from scratch in-house. And I think over the very long haul that will set us up quite well to compete in the midmarket and I think there will be a lot of value to that. And I think it\u2019s the new way of building one of these CRM companies in that all-in-one approach is really going to pay off. The way we describe it internally these days has changed the way we describe them. We call it our primary colors. So underneath HubSpot, you\u2019ve got data, you\u2019ve got automation, you\u2019ve got reporting, you\u2019ve got messaging, you\u2019ve got these different kind of shared services underneath it. And then the hubs themselves \u2013 our product managers and our developers and our designers, they\u2019re sort of creating these beautiful applications that are really easy to use in the frontend. And increasingly this year with Marketing Hub Enterprise, CMS Hub Enterprise, they deliver a real powerful punch on top of it. So feeling really good about that product. There will be more hubs to come down the road. We don\u2019t feel like we\u2019ve reached the edges of our vision for products we can build that help companies build great experiences in the front office here.\nBrian Peterson: Understood. That\u2019s great color, Brian. And maybe as a follow up, I just wanted to double click on linearity a bit. It sounds like things got better in June and July. Is that from a new customer logo perspective or is that also kind of from a retention perspective as well? Any color you can add on that. Thanks, guys.\nBrian Halligan: Yes. It\u2019s sort of a tale of three cities. January and February, wow, incredible. March through May, marshmallow soft. And then June and July, it felt like we got back on track a little bit. And the question I\u2019ve been asking myself is what\u2019s going on? How much of this is HubSpot and how much of this is COVID? And I kind of give credit to three things for the bounce back. One is, like for a long time we\u2019ve been espousing the vision of we need to move from offline marketing to online marketing, outside sales to inside sales to build a flywheel, to build great digitalized \u2013 use digital transformation to rethink your front office approach. And the stuff we thought was going to happen in the market for over the last six years really happened over the last \u2013 over six months now. It\u2019s really sped up. So our vision sort of matches the time. The plays we ran worked. We talked about the starter play. That worked really well, but there was a whole series of plays that we ran to help our customers and partners to weather the storm, and I think the team executed them really well. They were well conceived and well executed. And then the product I just talked about, we took two steps back last year so we could take four steps forward this year and I think we\u2019re getting return on that. We had two new product offerings this year in Marketing Hub Enterprise and the CMS Hub launch and our Net Promoter Scores are sky high. We broke a bunch of records with our Net Promoter Scores from our customers. So yes, I think it\u2019s been \u2013 we don\u2019t know what will happen in the future. This has been a terrible tragedy for so many people and so many companies and we don\u2019t know what will happen to the economy or to our demand curve in the future, so I can\u2019t [indiscernible] with that. But things did get better in June and July of course.\nBrian Peterson: Good to hear. Thanks, Brian.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Samad Samana from Jefferies.\nSamad Samana: Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. I\u2019ll echo the congrats on the strong performance. Brian, I wanted to ask this because I think historically hubs has done really well in B2B focused SMBs and I\u2019m curious if maybe in this kind of renewed pivot from offline to online if there\u2019s been any differences in the type of SMB that you\u2019re getting, whether there\u2019s more B2C in there or just whether there\u2019s smaller or larger as you think about that offline to online cohort in particular? And then I have one follow up.\nBrian Halligan: Not really. We\u2019ve got, Samad, a \u2013 there\u2019s a ginormous number of companies between 5 employees and 2,000, let\u2019s say. There\u2019s just a huge margin there. We have a very, very small percentage of that market on HubSpot. And so we\u2019re a little bit focused and we\u2019re sticking to our knitting to build out a killer solution for that target market before kind of getting distracted with totally new value props. So we\u2019ve got our heads down. We think there\u2019s a huge market. We think our value prop is really strong. We\u2019re really differentiated relative with competition. So we\u2019ve got our heads down cracking away [ph], Samad.\nSamad Samana: Got you. And then I know the kind of trends question has been asked, but maybe in a slightly different way. If you think about countries that are maybe further along the reopening path, as you\u2019ve seen those countries reopen, have you see a change in whether there were downgrades there to upgrading again or in terms of new deal activity, we\u2019re just trying to see if that\u2019s a leading indicator for what we might see in some countries like the U.S. that are earlier in the reopening cycle?\nBrian Halligan: It\u2019s a good question. Like Australia opened up a little earlier and that started getting a little better a little faster. But really across the developed markets, they all kind of moved in tandem quite honestly. Where they slowed a bit were in more of the emerging markets like EMEA, Latin America, places like that. And those markets are ones that \u2013 we don\u2019t have a huge presence in \u2013 anyway, we\u2019re pretty focused on the bigger markets and we haven\u2019t rushed into those emerging markets. So we haven\u2019t been super impacted. The thing we don\u2019t know is what will happen in the United States, what will happen in Europe and what the path of this thing is going to do? So it\u2019s hard to predict the future. But I would say, feeling cautiously optimistic relative to the last call we had with you folks last quarter.\nSamad Samana: Well, that\u2019s great to hear and we\u2019re certainly happy to see that as well. So thanks again and I\u2019ll hop out of the queue.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Alex Zukin from RBC.\nDylan Reider: Hi, guys. This is Dylan Reider on for Alex. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on a great quarter. Brian, I guess just to start, clearly this is a very disruptive time for some of your customers and that\u2019s causing headwinds in some cases and tailwinds in other cases. And you\u2019ve clearly been proactive in working with them to ensure they\u2019re getting value from HubSpot, and been effective in reducing churn and offering promotions on the Starter Suite. I guess just throughout all these conversations that you\u2019re having with customers and steps that you\u2019ve taken to work with them, could you just speak with maybe of the learnings and takeaways that you\u2019ve had as you think about your strategy coming out of COVID, anything new or different that you might take from an operational perspective from these conversations that you\u2019ve had with customers? Thanks.\nBrian Halligan: I think it\u2019s really just moving the future forward. It\u2019s some of the stuff we\u2019ve been espousing from stages in inbound, in books, in blog articles for 14 years that it\u2019s just a better way to go-to market. It manages the way people actually want to shop and buy and engage and we\u2019ve built a platform for that and I think it sort of matches the time. But no, no huge thing. I think that we ran a number of plays that seemed to land when this all stuff started and they\u2019ve been executed pretty well and I think we\u2019re pretty good. But no, we haven\u2019t done a big pivot. So we talked about it about two or three weeks into this like, well, this is going to be pretty bad. What do we need to change in our product roadmap to match this? And we were like, you know what, we actually built a product that\u2019s more suited for this stuff. So let\u2019s keep our head down and be cracking.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Walter Pritchard from Citi.\nWalter Pritchard: Hi. Thanks. A question on the customer adds and how you\u2019re thinking about those upselling as time goes on, especially relative to the customers you\u2019ve added in the past given the dynamics of the lower end product? And then had another question on expanding the product line.\nBrian Halligan: Yes. So we have a lot more of these Starter Suite customers coming in, Walter, a lot more. That\u2019s done really well. And we\u2019re watching the size of those cohorts. We\u2019re watching the upgrades and we\u2019re watching the cancellations. And so we\u2019re watching all very carefully and watching by cohort. The size is about the same as previous cohorts on that product line, which feels good to us that we didn\u2019t attract a bunch of kind of mom and pop in. The cancellations look real good. The upgrades aren\u2019t quite as good as previous cohorts but they\u2019re still pretty solid from that Starter to grow. So early signs are really good that we made a change there to our \u2013 the demand curve looked a little bit differently than we thought. We made a change to it and at least for now we\u2019re going to stick with it.\nWalter Pritchard: And then any change as to how you\u2019re thinking about the additions to product lines via M&A, any more confidence you have in your ability to do that to accelerate the roadmap or do you feel like you have enough on your plate at this point that that doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense?\nBrian Halligan: We look at deals and we\u2019re just picky and we\u2019re picky for a few reasons. One, part of the reason we went into marketplace is built this thing with love in-house. It is gorgeous frontend, consumer-like frontend and [indiscernible] single deal in the customer on the backend on a bunch of different funky systems kind of integrated together. Our Net Promoter Score word of mouth is going way up. Our product organization really took a couple of steps back. It was really [indiscernible] right now. So we feel like we have the ability at scale to build great new products that customers love. And so our confidence is high there -- higher now than it\u2019s even been. We\u2019ll be sensitive on evaluations to a certain extent. We\u2019ll be super sensitive on anything that messes with that core competitive advantage of our frontend. So we\u2019re just going to be very careful about M&A. And when we do them, they\u2019re going to be good deals and they\u2019re going to be thoughtfully done and they\u2019re going to be thoughtfully integrated. But we\u2019re unlikely to break our core value prop for some very short-term growth.\nWalter Pritchard: Great. Thanks, Brian.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Terry Tillman from SunTrust Securities [ph].\nTerry Tillman: Thanks for taking my question and congrats from me as well. Brian, one thing I\u2019ve always liked about HubSpot is just the testing and learning. You guys test a lot of things out, you learn and you iterate and you talk a lot about like running plays. What I\u2019m curious with CMS Hub is, what is some of the early feedback and learnings you\u2019re getting? Because where I\u2019m going with this, it seems like the Web\u2019s getting rebuilt. Clunky Web sites is not going to work anymore. And so do you see opportunity to CMS Hub to actually be kind of the tip of the spear, the wedge to go after new business as a way for folks to engage with HubSpot or am I thinking about this the wrong way and it\u2019s really more about going into the sticky install base? That\u2019s the first question.\nBrian Halligan: I think our sales organization will gravitate towards the lowest hanging fruit and that\u2019s likely within our install base and same with the part organization. But I think over the fullness of time, that will be a front door we bring lots and lots of customers in and that \u2013 by the way, I think you\u2019re right. I think the idea of a Web site \u2013 you don\u2019t want a Web site. You want to build the customer experience and that customer experience should be light and it should be modern and it should be the light bulb and you need a new type of CMS to pull that off, so you need to treat it like a first-class citizen, and that CMS has to be married to your CRM in [indiscernible]. So I feel really good about the CMS product. The product organization delivered and I think it could be a big business for us.\nTerry Tillman: Got it. And just to follow up related to \u2013 looking at kind of the durability of your Marketing Hub business, what I\u2019m curious about with the Marketing Hub Enterprise product, you got the A/B testing, you\u2019ve got the revenue attribution in ABM. I guess any of those features really resonating more than others in terms of either helping with new business or replacing legacy marketing automation platforms? Thank you.\nBrian Halligan: All of them are attribution reporting, it\u2019s been huge for us. A/B testing has been very solid and account-based marketing has been huge for us. And there were very thoughtfully done. They weren\u2019t bolted on to an acquisition. They were built with our primary colors. They\u2019re just beautifully executed inside the user base and that product\u2019s resonating really, really well. And we\u2019re getting lots of new customers but we\u2019re getting a little \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t say lot of rip and replace, a more legacy marketing automation vendors. The other thing I would say about HubSpot\u2019s Marketing Hub, it\u2019s not just marketing automation. I think a marketing automation is when people describe almost that old school middle of the funnel where you\u2019ve got the lead, you score the lead, you segment the lead, you do automation off that lead. HubSpot\u2019s Marketing Hub of course does all that stuff and really in a really elegant way. It does search engine optimization. You can do your advertising through it. You can do your social media through it. You can marry it with your Web site. You\u2019ve got [indiscernible] landing pages and your blog. It\u2019s much, much more than your garden variety marketing automation platform. So I\u2019m proud of the marketing team. They really innovated and banked on it. And the nice thing about that marketing industry is it\u2019s a big industry. There\u2019s a lot of money being spent in that industry. There\u2019s a lot of value being delivered. There\u2019s a lot more innovation coming ahead for us there.\nTerry Tillman: Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Ken Wong from Guggenheim Partners.\nKen Wong: Great. This first question\u2019s for Brian. 7,800 roughly net customer adds, significant uptake in the pace from you saw a year ago and even Q1. Can you help us kind of understand how much of that might have been just an initial surge to meet immediate demand or is there a new sustainable run rate that we should be thinking about from a customer adds perspective?\nBrian Halligan: I\u2019m going to let Kate take that one.\nKathryn Bueker: Yes. Thank you. So we were obviously very happy with 7,800 adds. I think we are also very happy that adds particularly in that Starter Growth Suite were pretty consistent month-over-month. We think it\u2019s sort of a bit of a new normal for us which we\u2019re excited about. The other thing that was a positive from our perspective is that it was not just in that sort of Starter Growth Suite where we saw some strength. The new customer adds were pretty strong across the board and we think that \u2013 as Brian highlighted says a lot about the value that our product is delivering. One thing that I would point out, we obviously saw the ASRPC drop quarter-over-quarter, not surprisingly. We talked about the fact that that was likely going to be the case on the last earnings call. And I think that you\u2019re seeing that for a couple of reasons. One is, that really significant traction that we\u2019re seeing at the low end of the portfolio is going to have sort of a natural mix impact there. And the other thing is that we have seen elevated downgrades throughout Q2 as a result of some of the plays that we\u2019re running around the COVID situation.\nKen Wong: Got it. And then maybe a quick follow up. As far as the net retention, you mentioned I think 90%. Last quarter you guys were talking about how things have potentially trend lower from the low 90s, but likely should be dropping in Q2. Should we view that 90% as the drop going forward?\nKathryn Bueker: Yes. I would say \u2013 what we sort of led you down sort of the path of trend here starting in January and February at that 100 plus which is a strong performance for us. And then in March that retention dropped to the low 90s. It did hang in there at 90% in Q2, which was a bit better than we had expected. As Brian said, who knows what the future brings but I am cautiously optimistic that we\u2019ve seen the bottom here. We did see retention strengthen month-in, month-out throughout Q2.\nKen Wong: Great. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Your next question comes from DJ Hynes from Canaccord.\nLuke Morison: Hi, guys. This is Luke on for DJ. So I wanted to dig a bit more on your CMS Hub and specifically whether or not the current environment has actually enhanced interest in that offering as traditionally brick and mortar businesses like to beef up their online presence. So any commentary there on the traction you\u2019re seeing specifically in that context of accelerating e-commerce adoption? Thanks.\nBrian Halligan: I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a huge factor quite honestly. Most of our customers are B2B. A lot of B2B companies [indiscernible] nice integration to Shopify and we have a bunch of customers using that. But I think the CMS Hub product is just better, a lot more people are buying it. And I think whether we were in COVID times and not COVID times, I think we\u2019d get a similar bump on that.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Peter Levine from Evercore.\nKirk Materne: Actually it\u2019s Kirk Materne. I hope you can hear me. I guess to start, Brian, could you just talk a little bit about the adoption of the starter pack? Is there any delineation between the Europe and U.S. just based on your customer growth in Europe, it seems that it\u2019s taken off perhaps faster in the U.S. But I was just kind of curious if there\u2019s any differential and how you\u2019re seeing that adoption from a geographic perspective?\nBrian Halligan: No. It\u2019s been pretty steady across Europe and the United States and the ratios are pretty similar. It seems like it landed in a similar way across all geographies, maybe a little softer in developing markets but really solid across the developed markets.\nKirk Materne: Okay. And then just, Kate, on the customer downgrade comments, it sounds like you feel like you\u2019re kind of getting through maybe the bulk of those conversations at this point and I don\u2019t want to put words in your mouth on that front. But does it feel like the amount of customers that are coming to you to talk about that is slowing and that obviously helps in terms of visibility and obviously NRR going forward? I just want to make sure I\u2019m clear on that point because that\u2019s what it sounds like. But again, I won\u2019t put words in your mouth.\nKathryn Bueker: Yes, I think you\u2019re right as it relates to that. We put in place a number of plays at the end of March designed to really help our customers weather a short-term impact here. And I think as Brian highlighted, they worked largely how we wanted them to. The volume of requests has continued to fall. And as I said in my prepared remarks, the first cohorts are starting to kind of come out the other side and frankly it\u2019s really early in that process. We have a long way to go, but the early signs are positive.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jennifer Lowe from UBS.\nJennifer Lowe: Great. Thank you. Actually just maybe just to finish up on that thought, Kay. When you talk about customers coming out the other side, does that mean that they\u2019re starting to move back up to where they were previously or are they\u2019re getting current on payment terms? What exactly does that look like when they come out the other side?\nKathryn Bueker: It\u2019s frankly all of the above, Jennifer. I think there\u2019s a variety of plays that we put in place, short-term discounts as one example. Many of the short-term discounts are 90 days in length, so customers would be starting to come out. And we have seen many of them progressing on a path toward more normal discount levels. Another play that we ran was around more flexible payment terms and that would mean that our customers are coming up and have a payment due, and we are all so pleased with the performance of those customers.\nJennifer Lowe: Great. And one more for me. If I look at the customer base and particularly at the enterprise or the more enterprise side of your base, I\u2019m just curious. As companies have to move faster, maybe they want a solution that\u2019s simpler given that things are changing so fast. I\u2019m just curious if that\u2019s created any differences in the conversations that you have or the win rates that you have when you\u2019re in a competitive situation where maybe buyer needs look a little different because the world looks a little different or what they\u2019re prioritizing is a little different, any color there would be interesting.\nBrian Halligan: Jennifer, if I think of the legacy SaaS providers, they\u2019re hard to set up, they\u2019re hard to use or hard to own. We\u2019re trying to gain where the rest of the market can\u2019t and we\u2019re trying to make it easy to buy, easy to set up, easy to use and easy to own. And I think it\u2019s just resonating well. I think our Marketing Hub Enterprise release we did in January worked and I think that CMS Hub Enterprise release we did in April is working. We\u2019ve always been really easy to use and we\u2019ve invested mass amounts in user research and design that\u2019s really paying off. And then we\u2019ve added a bunch of power and that\u2019s kind of the magic trick in itself. We just don\u2019t see that combination of the consumer frontend really easy to use with that power on the backend. And here we\u2019ve added a bunch and there\u2019s likely more to come.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Siti Panigrahi from Mizuho.\nSiti Panigrahi: Thanks for taking my question. Just want to double click on that comment on ASL, PC down 5%. You talked about big chunk [ph] of new customers taking [indiscernible] Starter Suite promotion. What percentage of existing Starter Suite customers also took advantage of that $50 promotion? And then I saw that your promotion was supposed to \u2013 price go up $75 in August but somehow extended to September. How should we think about the [indiscernible] for the rest of the year?\nKathryn Bueker: I\u2019ll start and then Brian if you want to add anything. The first thing that I would say is that the vast majority of customers that are adopting the Starter Growth Suite are new to HubSpot. So that\u2019s what\u2019s really driving the growth of that product. And as Brian said, we were a bit frankly surprised that this pricing change resonated as much as it did with the market and we\u2019ve seen really strong adoption here. We talked a lot about what to do about the pricing and we are obviously looking very closely at the performance of those cohorts, and for now we\u2019re going to keep it. And we will continue to look closely, but at least for the near term here it\u2019s going to remain at $50.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Michael Turrin from Wells Fargo.\nMichael Turrin: Thanks. Good afternoon. Maybe stepping outside the financials for a moment, HubSpot is known for its company culture. Your Glassdoor scores are consistently off the charts. I\u2019m just wondering how the pivot to remote work has been for the team given that close-knit community you\u2019ve built and maybe any observations you have around maintaining that culture with new hires likely coming on remotely as well, that would be insightful here as well?\nBrian Halligan: I can take that. That\u2019s a great question. So when COVID first hit, obviously we had to get all our employees out of all of our offices and in their homes and set up. That was challenging but I think it went pretty well. I give a lot of credit to our people ops team and to our facilities team. All our ops teams did a great job of that. I think part of the reason it went pretty well, we were leaning towards remote. Remote was our third biggest office when COVID hit and we were trying to make that a more attractive option for new employees and for existing employees, and we were on top of that. I do think our culture is very strong. I think it\u2019s a real advantage for us. One of the things that we also saw \u2013 it\u2019s been certainly an interesting and challenging six months between the health crisis going on, the economic crisis and it\u2019s sort of been a crisis of conscience as well with all the stuff going on with Black Lives Matter. We\u2019re leaning hard in there. We feel like our employees really care about diversity inclusion as I do too and we would like to make progress there. So we\u2019ve been rolling out initiatives internally to, not just talk about that in the short term but try to really move the needle on that stuff. So our culture\u2019s still very much at our forefront. We feel like we\u2019ve built two products. We built a product that attracts great customers and retain them and we built a product that attracts great employees and retains them. We just call that product culture.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Brent Bracelin from Piper Sandler.\nBrent Bracelin: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe I\u2019ll start with Kate and end with Brian. Kate, as you think about the due cohort of customers coming online here, what\u2019s the mix of billing terms between kind of monthly versus annual? Are you seeing that shift a little bit more towards monthly just given the current environment? Any color there would be helpful relative to the new cohort versus the traditional cohort you\u2019re seeing?\nKathryn Bueker: Sure. So the significant additions that we\u2019re seeing at the Starter tier will have monthly billings turns. And so that is probably the most notable shift. With respect to customers who are coming on to our professional and enterprise products, as I noted in my billing comments, we had thought that we would see a pretty significant reduction in the billing terms. That has sort of hung in there a little bit better than what we had thought.\nBrent Bracelin: Okay, that\u2019s helpful color. And then, Brian, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re able to answer this or not but I\u2019ll ask it anyway. I think a lot of the questions that have been asked and answered are really focusing around this idea of how much of momentum you\u2019re seeing in June to July is tied to the promotional activity versus this idea there is something more durable happening in the industry around the shift to kind of online, the shift to digital, even remote work where perhaps you need to have a modern kind of marketing sales approach in the midmarket? So as you think about those two drivers of what you\u2019re seeing in June, how much did we wait just around company-specific promotions driving the momentum here versus there could be a more durable trend?\nBrian Halligan: I think it\u2019s more durable. I don\u2019t think the promotions worked. And I think they were \u2013 they were well designed to work, but \u2013 we\u2019ve been talking about digital transformation for 14 years. We\u2019re talking about moving from offline marketing to online, from outbound marketing to inbound marketing, from outside sales to inbound sales, from phone to flywheels [ph]. We\u2019ve been screaming from the hills. And our vision of the future for our customers that we thought we\u2019d take five or six more years. Like there\u2019s a lot of urgency around it. And I think digital transformation is a massive wave that\u2019s been going on for a long, long time. It just picked up a little steam here. And our products are well suited, our vision\u2019s well suited, our services organization is serving them well. We got a good community around this. I think HubSpot well positioned for a nice run here, feed good.\nBrent Bracelin: Encouraging to hear. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Parker Lane from Stifel.\nParker Lane: Hi. It\u2019s Parker on for Tom Roderick. Thanks for taking my question. Just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the PieSync acquisition from late last year and how that business is tracking from an integration standpoint, go-to-market standpoint and just any other details you have there.\nBrian Halligan: I think it\u2019s going great. That team is doing terrific. They\u2019re working on some awesome stuff. And the business itself \u2013 it\u2019s a smaller business relative to HubSpot but it\u2019s grown faster than we thought and it\u2019s going really well. I think what\u2019s interesting about PieSync is they\u2019re capability and what they\u2019re like super focused on and they\u2019re really like fantastic at, if somebody\u2019s got one application and they want to sync their data, keep it synched together with another application, they eat, sleep, drink, live that problem. It is a sticky hard problem. It actually was not a problem we were particularly good at. It wasn\u2019t one of our primary colors. And so it\u2019s the perfect type of acquisition for us. We\u2019ve kind of added that primary color to us. So stay tuned for that. That capability is going to show up in other places and going to power some new capabilities down the road, and I\u2019m really feeling good about that piece.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Koji Ikeda from Oppenheimer.\nKoji Ikeda: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Great quarter. Congratulations. I just wanted to ask another question on net revenue retention trends and just thinking about the future a little bit fast forwarding into the future thinking about how the discounts today as those kind of normalize out and the annual discounts that you have, has those come up to renewal is the right way to think about net revenue retention? Will those \u2013 anniversarying of the discounts and normalization of the discounts act as a tailwind for net revenue retention trends to maybe boost us back up to over 100% in the future?\nKathryn Bueker: Yes. If I turn back the clock and talk about retention in a way that we were doing before the onset of COVID, I think what you would remember is that we would say that we believe we can have net revenue retention at 100 plus over the long term and I think we still fundamentally believe that is true. You are highlighting a trend that is real. We obviously saw some sharp headwinds due to the downgrade activity in Q2. And as the customers come off of short-term discounts and move towards more normal discounts, that is a tailwind to retention that will show up over the next few quarters. So from a near-term perspective, that should help.\nOperator: And that was our last question at this time. I will turn the call back over to Brian Halligan, CEO, for closing remarks.\nBrian Halligan: Thanks everybody for joining today. Hope you stay well and we\u2019ll see you at INBOUND.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Brian Halligan",
            "content": "Thanks, Chuck. Good afternoon, folks. Thank you for joining us today. The world's been through a lot in the last few months. Collectively, we're still weathering the storm and I'm happy to share progress HubSpot's made over the last quarter. Constant currency revenue growth was 26% in Q2 and non-GAAP operating margin was 9%. Total customers grew 34% year-over-year surpassing 86,000 while multi-product adoption continuing to grow nicely, representing over 38,000 customers. We were fortunate back in Q1 to have some wind in our backs after a strong start to the year. Nevertheless, the onslaught of the global pandemic was felt throughout our company and our customer base and much of our spring was focused on helping our customers and partners respond to the economic downturn. Today, I'm thankful to say that the disruptive headwinds we faced early in Q2 has eased and might have even begun to shift a bit in our favor, helped along by some nice execution in some important plays we ran. We've had a strong product year so far that's raised the power of our enterprise tier while also adding new products to the mix. This began in Q1 with the introduction of an entirely updated version of Marketing Hub Enterprise. With this relaunch came a ton of advanced features, including revenue attribution reporting, AI-powered A/B testing and account-based marketing. Marketers can now start with us at an early stage and grow with us into a large scale now that we've released this product. Marketing Hub Enterprise is really resonating nicely for us in the market. In Q2, we introduced a new product line, CMS Hub. This is the completely re-imagined version of our previous CMS Add-on with advanced features making up of Pro and Enterprise tier. We have found strong product market fit in the midmarket between simple but limited Web site products in overly complex content management systems. CMS Hub gives companies the benefit of advanced features like dynamic content, adaptive testing and 24/7 security monitoring, with not all that heavy maintenance and design needs that comes with legacy content management system solutions. Companies and organizations like ClassPass, World Wildlife Fund and Randstad have not built sites on the new CMS Hub. The formulization of our CMS Hub through the addition of these tiers led to a really nice reacceleration in growth in our product line. You see, the traditional enterprise SaaS playbook is to cobble together a product through acquisitions. This approach has led to a pretty rough enterprise frontend for a lot of products married to a pretty solid enterprise backend. HubSpot has skewed that traditional approach. We've chosen instead to handcraft our product in-house. You see, underneath HubSpot, there's only one view of that customer and a consistent user experience across that frontend. We've married a consumer-like frontend with new enterprise power and this is giving us a real advantage in the marketplace. I think our patient approach and our slight obsession with Apple is starting to really pay off. Now, we haven't just been working on that Enterprise tier. To help more businesses make the transition from offline to online after the crisis hit, we reduced the first year price of our Starter Growth Suite by more 50% and increased email send in call limit. Additionally, we released greater editing controls of our ad campaigns across Google, Facebook and LinkedIn marketing starter. All of this resulted in a 400% plus increase in our starter and install base growth as free users upgraded and many new businesses moved fully online for the first time. We coupled this on ramp to HubSpot with a surge in educational content and we've seen record engagement in HubSpot Academy as a result. In fact, in Q2 we saw nearly 150% increase year-over-year in Academy sign ups and similarly strong growth on the number of people getting certified on HubSpot, really great stuff. I'm incredibly proud of the way the entire HubSpot team continued to deliver on our product roadmap embedded to help our customers amid rapidly changing times. Companies in nearly every industry have had to move their teams, their go-to market strategies and the entire customer experience online. What might have been a gradual digital transformation for some businesses has now been dramatically accelerated by the impact of the pandemic and we've become the platform to support that transformation in the midmarket. I'm encouraged by the transaction we saw in the second quarter and we see evidence of a continuation of that performance in the early part of Q3. But this short-term demand environment is still quite fluid, so we're watching things very closely. Now, I'll hand things over to Kate to take you through our Q2 financial and operating results in more detail. The story of 2020 has thus far been one of adversity. As a society, we faced the public health crisis and economic crisis and a crisis of conscience. When the dust settles, the world will be changed. We're trying to lean into the future ourselves and help pull our customers and partners with us. On the conscience side of that equation, at HubSpot we've been working to advance diversity inclusion and belonging in our culture representation. We have a long way to go, so it's become one of our top strategic priorities. It's also become important for me personally to learn, evolve and speak out against racial injustice in the ways that I can. My hope is that what started as a story of adversity this year will become one of resilience and resilience relies on diversity. Thank you for your time. I look forward to seeing many of you again at our first-ever virtual Analyst Day as part of INBOUND 20 on September 22. We re-imagined the Analyst Day this year in more ways than one, so I'll see you all there. Okay, operator, let's open it up to some questions. Hi, Stan. Thanks for the question and hope you're well. That's something we're actually watching relatively closely. Kate and I were just talking about that. We've been, I would say, presently surprised with that Starter Suite adoption. Just to refresh everyone on the call's memory [ph], we lowered the price in starter suite to get the marketing, sales and service product altogether by 66%, so it's $50 a month now in the first 12 months. And we did that right when COVID started and it worked. There's been really nice adoption of it and you can see that with lots of new starter suite customers in that 1,700 net new customers' number. So we're really happy with it and we're watching those cohorts super carefully. We're looking at the quality of those cohorts, like what is the size and makeup of the company who's buying it? What is the retention rate calculation on those cohorts and what's the upgrade rate? And so far so good. They look pretty good. They are similar sized companies that were buying Starter Suite before. The retention rates look pretty good. So we're going to keep that first year of $50 for now and see if we can use that as a gross lever going forward. We're pretty happy with it. Okay. I guess at a high level, the international business is going really well and I think that's because we've made some big investments over the last five years and we're starting to get a return on those investments, like big investment in offices. In Europe, we have a large office in Dublin now. We have Paris, we have Berlin. We've got offices in Japan, in Singapore, in Sydney and even one in Latin America now. So those are big investments we've invested heavily in translating not just our products into different languages but the whole customer experience in different languages. We're getting nice return on that. I think another reason international is doing so well is just unit economics are really good. We're growing fast and cost to acquire customer relative to total lifetime value [indiscernible], so we're hiring a little faster there. I guess in terms of North America, I've continued to be bullish about it. It's a huge market. We've got great product market that tons and tons of happy customers, a good word of mouth. The sales organization in North America is mature. I think we're set up well for steady strong growth in North America for several years to come here and I feel good about it. Thank you for the question. I guess it's a little of both. I'm very excited about that new hub. It's a funny industry. The industry \u2013 down on the bottom of the industry, you've got like really strong SaaS players like Wix and there's a company called Squarespace that's private that's doing really well down there in their SaaS product. But most of the market is buying kind of open source, client server technology. And it's funny that way. And so we feel like there's a big opportunity to build a true SaaS product and all those benefits of the SaaS product. We think we have a great advantage in this market because we've built that CMS from scratch and we've built our CRM from scratch and it's 1 plus 1 equals 10 when you combine those two products together with the same user interface and you're just able to create a great experience for your customers to use them together. So I feel really good about it. We're getting lots of new accounts through it and we're getting some upsell through it. We couldn't have launched it in a worse time. We launched it in April. But despite having terrible timing on launching it, it's done really, really well and I think that's going to be a big help for us, kind of like -- Sure. Just to refresh everyone's memory on the call. When things first started hitting in kind of mid-March, one of several things we ran was to advance six months of commissions to our partners and I think that went over really well. I think that worked for us and worked for them. They were able to kind of stabilize their business. I think it prevented layoffs in a lot of cases, so I'm feeling very good about that call. And I think our partners are generally weathering the storm quite well. If I look at the numbers through Q2 and even through July, they looked pretty solid and stable. I don't see any big red flags. They seem to be weathering. I think some are doing a lot better than others, some are feeling more headwinds and some tailwinds but generally feeling pretty good about that market channel right now. Not really. The thing about that's kind of interesting is there's some industries that have just been decimated and it's brutal on a couple of industries. We just didn't have a lot of concentration in some of those industries, like restaurants and hospitality and travel. Those are pretty small for us. We've got a heavy concentration in B2B. The other side of that is people call us SMB software. We're more M than S, like more than two-thirds of our revenue comes from companies that are over 25 employees. So we're a little bit like NetSuite is for the back office and HubSpot is to the front office. So we were definitely impacted. We felt a strong headwind as demand was soft like a marshmallow in Q2, but feel a lot better about things in June and July. Well, we're certainly not done with hubs, I can tell you that. I guess if I just sort of take a step back and think about HubSpot and kind of what's going on inside of HubSpot is a year ago when we were on this call, we talked a bunch about taking a step or two back so that we could go three or four steps fast here. We were super patient about that. And that's paying off for us now. And you could kind of see it with us in January and February, we get off to just a killer start to the year. We've announced that Marketing Hub Enterprise product did really well and we're starting to get a real return on it. The other thing around patience for us, we get a different approach to building our company and our product. If you look across enterprise software in the CRM industry, there's lots of companies in enterprise CRM. They're more like private equity companies with giant sales forces attached to them than they are like true software companies. They cobble their solutions together with M&A. We kind of handcrafted from scratch in-house. And I think over the very long haul that will set us up quite well to compete in the midmarket and I think there will be a lot of value to that. And I think it's the new way of building one of these CRM companies in that all-in-one approach is really going to pay off. The way we describe it internally these days has changed the way we describe them. We call it our primary colors. So underneath HubSpot, you've got data, you've got automation, you've got reporting, you've got messaging, you've got these different kind of shared services underneath it. And then the hubs themselves \u2013 our product managers and our developers and our designers, they're sort of creating these beautiful applications that are really easy to use in the frontend. And increasingly this year with Marketing Hub Enterprise, CMS Hub Enterprise, they deliver a real powerful punch on top of it. So feeling really good about that product. There will be more hubs to come down the road. We don't feel like we've reached the edges of our vision for products we can build that help companies build great experiences in the front office here. Yes. It's sort of a tale of three cities. January and February, wow, incredible. March through May, marshmallow soft. And then June and July, it felt like we got back on track a little bit. And the question I've been asking myself is what's going on? How much of this is HubSpot and how much of this is COVID? And I kind of give credit to three things for the bounce back. One is, like for a long time we've been espousing the vision of we need to move from offline marketing to online marketing, outside sales to inside sales to build a flywheel, to build great digitalized \u2013 use digital transformation to rethink your front office approach. And the stuff we thought was going to happen in the market for over the last six years really happened over the last \u2013 over six months now. It's really sped up. So our vision sort of matches the time. The plays we ran worked. We talked about the starter play. That worked really well, but there was a whole series of plays that we ran to help our customers and partners to weather the storm, and I think the team executed them really well. They were well conceived and well executed. And then the product I just talked about, we took two steps back last year so we could take four steps forward this year and I think we're getting return on that. We had two new product offerings this year in Marketing Hub Enterprise and the CMS Hub launch and our Net Promoter Scores are sky high. We broke a bunch of records with our Net Promoter Scores from our customers. So yes, I think it's been \u2013 we don't know what will happen in the future. This has been a terrible tragedy for so many people and so many companies and we don't know what will happen to the economy or to our demand curve in the future, so I can't [indiscernible] with that. But things did get better in June and July of course. Not really. We've got, Samad, a \u2013 there's a ginormous number of companies between 5 employees and 2,000, let's say. There's just a huge margin there. We have a very, very small percentage of that market on HubSpot. And so we're a little bit focused and we're sticking to our knitting to build out a killer solution for that target market before kind of getting distracted with totally new value props. So we've got our heads down. We think there's a huge market. We think our value prop is really strong. We're really differentiated relative with competition. So we've got our heads down cracking away [ph], Samad. It's a good question. Like Australia opened up a little earlier and that started getting a little better a little faster. But really across the developed markets, they all kind of moved in tandem quite honestly. Where they slowed a bit were in more of the emerging markets like EMEA, Latin America, places like that. And those markets are ones that \u2013 we don't have a huge presence in \u2013 anyway, we're pretty focused on the bigger markets and we haven't rushed into those emerging markets. So we haven't been super impacted. The thing we don't know is what will happen in the United States, what will happen in Europe and what the path of this thing is going to do? So it's hard to predict the future. But I would say, feeling cautiously optimistic relative to the last call we had with you folks last quarter. I think it's really just moving the future forward. It's some of the stuff we've been espousing from stages in inbound, in books, in blog articles for 14 years that it's just a better way to go-to market. It manages the way people actually want to shop and buy and engage and we've built a platform for that and I think it sort of matches the time. But no, no huge thing. I think that we ran a number of plays that seemed to land when this all stuff started and they've been executed pretty well and I think we're pretty good. But no, we haven't done a big pivot. So we talked about it about two or three weeks into this like, well, this is going to be pretty bad. What do we need to change in our product roadmap to match this? And we were like, you know what, we actually built a product that's more suited for this stuff. So let's keep our head down and be cracking. Yes. So we have a lot more of these Starter Suite customers coming in, Walter, a lot more. That's done really well. And we're watching the size of those cohorts. We're watching the upgrades and we're watching the cancellations. And so we're watching all very carefully and watching by cohort. The size is about the same as previous cohorts on that product line, which feels good to us that we didn't attract a bunch of kind of mom and pop in. The cancellations look real good. The upgrades aren't quite as good as previous cohorts but they're still pretty solid from that Starter to grow. So early signs are really good that we made a change there to our \u2013 the demand curve looked a little bit differently than we thought. We made a change to it and at least for now we're going to stick with it. We look at deals and we're just picky and we're picky for a few reasons. One, part of the reason we went into marketplace is built this thing with love in-house. It is gorgeous frontend, consumer-like frontend and [indiscernible] single deal in the customer on the backend on a bunch of different funky systems kind of integrated together. Our Net Promoter Score word of mouth is going way up. Our product organization really took a couple of steps back. It was really [indiscernible] right now. So we feel like we have the ability at scale to build great new products that customers love. And so our confidence is high there -- higher now than it's even been. We'll be sensitive on evaluations to a certain extent. We'll be super sensitive on anything that messes with that core competitive advantage of our frontend. So we're just going to be very careful about M&A. And when we do them, they're going to be good deals and they're going to be thoughtfully done and they're going to be thoughtfully integrated. But we're unlikely to break our core value prop for some very short-term growth. I think our sales organization will gravitate towards the lowest hanging fruit and that's likely within our install base and same with the part organization. But I think over the fullness of time, that will be a front door we bring lots and lots of customers in and that \u2013 by the way, I think you're right. I think the idea of a Web site \u2013 you don't want a Web site. You want to build the customer experience and that customer experience should be light and it should be modern and it should be the light bulb and you need a new type of CMS to pull that off, so you need to treat it like a first-class citizen, and that CMS has to be married to your CRM in [indiscernible]. So I feel really good about the CMS product. The product organization delivered and I think it could be a big business for us. All of them are attribution reporting, it's been huge for us. A/B testing has been very solid and account-based marketing has been huge for us. And there were very thoughtfully done. They weren't bolted on to an acquisition. They were built with our primary colors. They're just beautifully executed inside the user base and that product's resonating really, really well. And we're getting lots of new customers but we're getting a little \u2013 I wouldn't say lot of rip and replace, a more legacy marketing automation vendors. The other thing I would say about HubSpot's Marketing Hub, it's not just marketing automation. I think a marketing automation is when people describe almost that old school middle of the funnel where you've got the lead, you score the lead, you segment the lead, you do automation off that lead. HubSpot's Marketing Hub of course does all that stuff and really in a really elegant way. It does search engine optimization. You can do your advertising through it. You can do your social media through it. You can marry it with your Web site. You've got [indiscernible] landing pages and your blog. It's much, much more than your garden variety marketing automation platform. So I'm proud of the marketing team. They really innovated and banked on it. And the nice thing about that marketing industry is it's a big industry. There's a lot of money being spent in that industry. There's a lot of value being delivered. There's a lot more innovation coming ahead for us there. I'm going to let Kate take that one. I don't think that's a huge factor quite honestly. Most of our customers are B2B. A lot of B2B companies [indiscernible] nice integration to Shopify and we have a bunch of customers using that. But I think the CMS Hub product is just better, a lot more people are buying it. And I think whether we were in COVID times and not COVID times, I think we'd get a similar bump on that. No. It's been pretty steady across Europe and the United States and the ratios are pretty similar. It seems like it landed in a similar way across all geographies, maybe a little softer in developing markets but really solid across the developed markets. Jennifer, if I think of the legacy SaaS providers, they're hard to set up, they're hard to use or hard to own. We're trying to gain where the rest of the market can't and we're trying to make it easy to buy, easy to set up, easy to use and easy to own. And I think it's just resonating well. I think our Marketing Hub Enterprise release we did in January worked and I think that CMS Hub Enterprise release we did in April is working. We've always been really easy to use and we've invested mass amounts in user research and design that's really paying off. And then we've added a bunch of power and that's kind of the magic trick in itself. We just don't see that combination of the consumer frontend really easy to use with that power on the backend. And here we've added a bunch and there's likely more to come. I can take that. That's a great question. So when COVID first hit, obviously we had to get all our employees out of all of our offices and in their homes and set up. That was challenging but I think it went pretty well. I give a lot of credit to our people ops team and to our facilities team. All our ops teams did a great job of that. I think part of the reason it went pretty well, we were leaning towards remote. Remote was our third biggest office when COVID hit and we were trying to make that a more attractive option for new employees and for existing employees, and we were on top of that. I do think our culture is very strong. I think it's a real advantage for us. One of the things that we also saw \u2013 it's been certainly an interesting and challenging six months between the health crisis going on, the economic crisis and it's sort of been a crisis of conscience as well with all the stuff going on with Black Lives Matter. We're leaning hard in there. We feel like our employees really care about diversity inclusion as I do too and we would like to make progress there. So we've been rolling out initiatives internally to, not just talk about that in the short term but try to really move the needle on that stuff. So our culture's still very much at our forefront. We feel like we've built two products. We built a product that attracts great customers and retain them and we built a product that attracts great employees and retains them. We just call that product culture. I think it's more durable. I don't think the promotions worked. And I think they were \u2013 they were well designed to work, but \u2013 we've been talking about digital transformation for 14 years. We're talking about moving from offline marketing to online, from outbound marketing to inbound marketing, from outside sales to inbound sales, from phone to flywheels [ph]. We've been screaming from the hills. And our vision of the future for our customers that we thought we'd take five or six more years. Like there's a lot of urgency around it. And I think digital transformation is a massive wave that's been going on for a long, long time. It just picked up a little steam here. And our products are well suited, our vision's well suited, our services organization is serving them well. We got a good community around this. I think HubSpot well positioned for a nice run here, feed good. I think it's going great. That team is doing terrific. They're working on some awesome stuff. And the business itself \u2013 it's a smaller business relative to HubSpot but it's grown faster than we thought and it's going really well. I think what's interesting about PieSync is they're capability and what they're like super focused on and they're really like fantastic at, if somebody's got one application and they want to sync their data, keep it synched together with another application, they eat, sleep, drink, live that problem. It is a sticky hard problem. It actually was not a problem we were particularly good at. It wasn't one of our primary colors. And so it's the perfect type of acquisition for us. We've kind of added that primary color to us. So stay tuned for that. That capability is going to show up in other places and going to power some new capabilities down the road, and I'm really feeling good about that piece. Thanks everybody for joining today. Hope you stay well and we'll see you at INBOUND."

            "content": "Thanks, Brian. Let's turn to our second quarter financial results and our guidance for the third quarter and full year 2020. Second quarter revenue grew 26% year-over-year in constant currency and 25% as reported. Q2 subscription revenue grew 26% year-over-year while services revenue declined 3% year-over-year on an as reported basis. Domestic revenue grew 20% in Q2 while international revenue growth was 36% year-over-year in constant currency and 32% as reported. International revenue represented 42% of total revenue in Q2, up 2 points year-over-year. Deferred revenue as of the end of June was $241 million, a 22% increase year-over-year. Calculated billings was $202 million, up 21% year-over-year both on an as reported basis and in constant currency. HubSpot ended the second quarter with over 86,000 total customers, which was up 34% year-over-year. Net customer additions exceeded 7,800 and set a company record, driven by strong demand across our entire product portfolio but particularly in our Starter Growth Suite. Average subscription revenue per customer of nearly $9,500 was down both sequentially and year-over-year as a result of the strength we've seen at the low end of the portfolio combined with elevated levels of customer downgrades. As we highlighted last quarter, we took some proactive measures in late March to help alleviate the impact of COVID-19 for our customers and partners. These included offering flexible payment terms and customer friendly downgrade alternatives to our most impacted customers and prepaying some partner commissions. As a result, we expected retention rates to trend lower in Q2 due to the weaker economic environment as well as the impact from our customer friendly programs. While we did in fact see pressure on our retention rates in Q2, we maintained a net revenue retention rate of 90% with the majority of the decline continuing to come from customer downgrades. It's still quite early, but we have seen encouraging performance from the first cohorts of customers coming off these short-term discounts and moving back to more normal pricing. I want to stress that the near-term economic environment is still uncertain, but we're cautiously optimistic that the plays we've put in place helped our customers and partners adapt in these difficult times. The remainder of my comments will refer to non-GAAP measures. Second quarter gross margin was 82%, flat year-over-year. Subscription gross margin was 86% while services gross margin was negative 8%. Second quarter operating margin was 9%, up slightly compared to the same period last year. Operating margins in the quarter exceeded our expectations as a result of strong revenue performance as well as reduced travel and other discretionary expenses related to our shift to work from home. While we plan to maintain a disciplined approach to investment through the remainder of 2020, we expect our planned return to work initiative and continued investment in R&D to largely offset these expense savings. At the end of the second quarter, we had 3,769 employees, up 29% year-over-year. We expect total headcount growth to moderate in the second half of the year as we start to compare against our strong hiring quarters from 2019. Net income in the second quarter was $17 million or $0.34 per diluted share. CapEx, including capitalized software development costs, was $14 million or 7% of revenue in the quarter. We continue to expect CapEx as a percentage of revenue to be about 7% in 2020. Free cash flow in the second quarter was $800,000 driven by strong business performance and better than expected customer cash inflows. As a result, we are increasing our expectations for full year 2020 free cash flow to approximately $40 million. HubSpot ended the quarter with $1.2 billion of cash and marketable securities. At the beginning of June, we successfully executed a $460 million convertible bond issuance with the concurrent repurchase of roughly 70% of our existing convertible bond due in 2022. As we look to the future, we remain confident that our strong balance sheet will provide us with the financial flexibility to invest for the long term. And with that, let's dive into guidance for the third quarter and full year of 2020. For the third quarter, total revenue is expected to be in the range of $210 million to $211 million, up 21% year-over-year at the midpoint. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be between $7.5 million and $8.5 million. This range includes a 1 point headwind to operating margins from our INBOUND event in September.  Non-GAAP diluted net income per share is expected to be between $0.11 and $0.13. This assumes 48.8 million fully diluted shares outstanding. And for the full year of 2020, total revenue is now expected to be in a range of $828 million to $832 million, up 23% year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating income is now expected to be in the range of $52 million to $54 million. Non-GAAP diluted net income per share is now expected to be between $0.92 and $0.96. This assumes 48.5 million fully diluted shares outstanding. Our guidance reflects a view of the business that we are comfortable with today given the current economic environment, and also factors in heightened future uncertainty caused by the pandemic. As you adjust your models, keep in mind the following. As a result of the recent weakening of the U.S. dollar, we have seen a meaningful reduction in the headwinds related to foreign currency for the remainder of the year. At current spot rates, we now expect a 1 point FX tailwind to Q3 reported revenue and a neutral FX impact to reported revenue for the full year 2020. In Q2, we elected to begin tax affecting our non-GAAP net income which we believe better aligns with SEC guidance. Our updated non-GAAP EPS guidance for Q3 and the full year of 2020 includes the impact of this change. Importantly, this change does not impact our historical reported GAAP financials. Please refer to the table included in our press release for the historical impact to prior period non-GAAP earnings. In Q2, we excluded the accounting impact of our convertible debt repurchase from our non-GAAP net income and free cash flow. Please refer to the non-GAAP net income and free cash flow reconciliation tables included in our press release for more information. And with that, I'll hand the call over to Brian for his closing remarks. Stan, I would just add to Brian's comments. If you look \u2013 the overall revenue growth decelerated from Q1 to Q2. And if you look at U.S. and international, what you saw in sort of the more mature, more developed markets is a very similar level of deceleration across those markets. Where we saw a bit of an outsized impact was really on some of the more emerging markets. Yes, sure thing. So Q2 billings came in probably a little bit better than what we had thought or hoped for. Most of that frankly is just driven by solid performance on the new business side. But one of the things that we talked about last quarter was that we also expected that we would see a decrease in billing term during the sort of period of economic turbulence. And we saw a little bit better performance on that regard in Q2. We continue to expect to see in our customer base some duration compression over time and that will cause billings growth to be a little bit shy of revenue growth at constant currency. Yes. I guess I would just start by saying that we approached guidance with the same sort of foundational framework that we've always approached guidance. Our model is quite predictable, particularly as it relates to sort of short term. Much like we did last quarter, we sort of recognized that there is more forward-looking uncertainty and we ran a bit of a broader set of scenarios to look at the second half of the year and to try to understand sort of upside and downside outcomes. And frankly we feel really confident about the numbers we're putting forward. Yes, sure. Multi-product customers do tend to retain better than single-product customers and we continue to see that in the quarter. That has not changed. Yes. Thank you. So we were obviously very happy with 7,800 adds. I think we are also very happy that adds particularly in that Starter Growth Suite were pretty consistent month-over-month. We think it's sort of a bit of a new normal for us which we're excited about. The other thing that was a positive from our perspective is that it was not just in that sort of Starter Growth Suite where we saw some strength. The new customer adds were pretty strong across the board and we think that \u2013 as Brian highlighted says a lot about the value that our product is delivering. One thing that I would point out, we obviously saw the ASRPC drop quarter-over-quarter, not surprisingly. We talked about the fact that that was likely going to be the case on the last earnings call. And I think that you're seeing that for a couple of reasons. One is, that really significant traction that we're seeing at the low end of the portfolio is going to have sort of a natural mix impact there. And the other thing is that we have seen elevated downgrades throughout Q2 as a result of some of the plays that we're running around the COVID situation. Yes. I would say \u2013 what we sort of led you down sort of the path of trend here starting in January and February at that 100 plus which is a strong performance for us. And then in March that retention dropped to the low 90s. It did hang in there at 90% in Q2, which was a bit better than we had expected. As Brian said, who knows what the future brings but I am cautiously optimistic that we've seen the bottom here. We did see retention strengthen month-in, month-out throughout Q2. Yes, I think you're right as it relates to that. We put in place a number of plays at the end of March designed to really help our customers weather a short-term impact here. And I think as Brian highlighted, they worked largely how we wanted them to. The volume of requests has continued to fall. And as I said in my prepared remarks, the first cohorts are starting to kind of come out the other side and frankly it's really early in that process. We have a long way to go, but the early signs are positive. It's frankly all of the above, Jennifer. I think there's a variety of plays that we put in place, short-term discounts as one example. Many of the short-term discounts are 90 days in length, so customers would be starting to come out. And we have seen many of them progressing on a path toward more normal discount levels. Another play that we ran was around more flexible payment terms and that would mean that our customers are coming up and have a payment due, and we are all so pleased with the performance of those customers. I'll start and then Brian if you want to add anything. The first thing that I would say is that the vast majority of customers that are adopting the Starter Growth Suite are new to HubSpot. So that's what's really driving the growth of that product. And as Brian said, we were a bit frankly surprised that this pricing change resonated as much as it did with the market and we've seen really strong adoption here. We talked a lot about what to do about the pricing and we are obviously looking very closely at the performance of those cohorts, and for now we're going to keep it. And we will continue to look closely, but at least for the near term here it's going to remain at $50. Sure. So the significant additions that we're seeing at the Starter tier will have monthly billings turns. And so that is probably the most notable shift. With respect to customers who are coming on to our professional and enterprise products, as I noted in my billing comments, we had thought that we would see a pretty significant reduction in the billing terms. That has sort of hung in there a little bit better than what we had thought. Yes. If I turn back the clock and talk about retention in a way that we were doing before the onset of COVID, I think what you would remember is that we would say that we believe we can have net revenue retention at 100 plus over the long term and I think we still fundamentally believe that is true. You are highlighting a trend that is real. We obviously saw some sharp headwinds due to the downgrade activity in Q2. And as the customers come off of short-term discounts and move towards more normal discounts, that is a tailwind to retention that will show up over the next few quarters. So from a near-term perspective, that should help."

Now my pleasure to turn over the call to HubSpot's CEO and Chairman, Brian Halligan.\nBrian Halligan: Thanks, Chuck. Good afternoon, folks. Thank you for joining us today. We're on this call to talk about HubSpot's business, but I want to take a moment to recognize the toll this pandemic has taken on so many people around the globe and closer to home right here in the HubSpot community. These are tough times. I hope all of you on the call are staying healthy and managing through this as well as you can. Now let's talk about HubSpot's first quarter earnings results. We came into this year with strong tailwinds. Constant currency revenue growth was 33% in Q1, and non-GAAP operating margins were just over 7%. Total customers grew 30% year-over-year, surpassing 78,000, while multiproduct adoption continued to grow nicely, representing nearly 32,000 customers. On the product front, we kicked off the year with an exciting relaunch of the enterprise tier for Marketing Hub. Marketing Hub Enterprise has always been easy to use, but the relaunch made it more powerful than ever before, with better attribution reporting, account-based marketing, advanced chat targeting and much more. We have an excellent offering that delivers great value to our enterprise segment now, and that's borne out by customer use. This product is 1 in 6 separate enterprise categories from G2, the main peer-based software review set. Now those tailwinds, they continued through much of the first quarter. However, in the middle of March, they were met by strong headwinds as the world felt the impact of the pandemic. Now rather than fight against that wind, we're trying to move with it through a series of plays designed to help our customers and partners reach the gap to better times. When the health crisis hit, our immediate focus turned to helping our customers and partners navigate this sudden economic downturn. With that in mind, we expedited Q1 commissions to all solutions partners, and we offered a 6-month commission prepayment to platinum, diamond and elite partners. To help customers and prospects, meaning to rapidly move their go-to-market strategies online, we took several steps. We lifted e-mail and calling limits and added a collection of features, including meetings, bots and 1:1 video into our free CRM. We also reduced the price of our starter growth suite by over 50% late in the quarter. We did this to alleviate the financial strain for our customers on the starter products and to enable more companies under financial strain to get started with HubSpot. This resulted in a fivefold increase in the run rate of that offering at the end of the quarter. Finally, we gave our team a lot of leeway to offer discounts and flexible payment terms to certain customers under more severe short-term financial strain. The way I like to think about the pandemic for HubSpot is that it's like a big storm that blew into our business in the middle of March. The first few weeks, it's largely just a big 200-mile an hour headwind that hit the new business and retention side of our business at the same time. But over the last few weeks of April, the winds have shifted. I'd say we have 150-mile an hour headwind now, but that's coupled with 100-mile an hour tailwind as business has been picking up. And when I take a step back, that tailwind makes sense. The world is seeing a surge of companies with historically offline, old school go-to-market models leaning into a new school online go-to-market models for the first time. The very platform we sell and methodology we teach was designed to help companies make this shift. These trends represent a long-term tailwind for HubSpot, and I think it's one that will outlast the near-term volatility that we're all experiencing in the current downturn. We have not stopped building for the future. In April, we introduced a new product line, CMS Hub. Similar to Marketing Hub Enterprise, we wanted to combine the ease of use growing companies want with the power they need. The result was the content management system designed to help growing businesses overcome the notoriously painful experience of managing websites at scale. Many companies think they only have 2 options for managing their websites at basic CMS with very limited functionality or a technically complicated one with tons of administrative pains. CMS Hub is a better fit for growing companies that need features like dynamic content, adaptive testing and 24/7 security monitoring. And even some tooling, it starts to blur the gap between websites and web apps all without the heavy maintenance. We've been really pleased to see the positive reception that CMS has had with our customers and our partners despite the macro environment. In fact, given this rare moment in the history when humans are shifted into creating digital experiences that rival in-person ones, CMS Hub might have come along at just the right time. As I said before, these are indeed tough times. Having said that, HubSpot is in a good position to help our customers in the market with large weathered but tough times and come out stronger on the other side. To that end, we're continuing to invest and innovate, and we expect to be in an even stronger position when we come out the other side. Now before I hand it over, I want to share some news that our longtime President and Chief Operating Officer, JD Sherman, has decided to leave HubSpot. JD has been instrumental in driving HubSpot's global growth over the last 8 years and has left an indelible imprint on our customers, partners and employees. JD will stay on until July 1 and will continue as an adviser until the end of the year. He will leave behind a well-oiled operating system and a world-class team that will serve us exceptionally well in the years to come. While I'm sad to see him go, I'm proud of the work we've done and eager to see him become a great CEO wherever he lands. So on behalf of HubSpot, the Board of Directors and our employees around the world, I want to say thank you, JD. We've all grown better because of you. Okay. With that, I'll turn it over to Kate now to take us through the financials and our guidance.\nKate Bueker: Thanks, Brian. Let's turn to our first quarter financial results and our guidance for the second quarter and full year 2020. The first quarter revenue grew 33% year-over-year in constant currency and 31% as reported. Q1 subscription revenue grew 33% year-over-year, while services revenue grew 2% year-over-year, both on an as-reported basis. Domestic revenue grew 25% in Q1, while international revenue growth was 45% year-over-year in constant currency and 41% as reported. International revenue represented 42% of total revenue in Q1, up 3 points year-over-year. Deferred revenue as of the end of March was $242 million, a 25% increase year-over-year. Calculated billings was $207 million, up 30% year-over-year on an as-reported basis and 32% in constant currency. HubSpot ended the first quarter with 78,776 total customers, which was up 30% year-over-year. Customer net additions exceeded 5,000 for the first time, driven by a strength at the low end of our product portfolio, particularly in our starter suite. Average subscription revenue per customer in Q1 was $10,018, and up slightly, both sequentially and year-over-year. In addition to the proactive product changes Brian highlighted, we have also taken some important steps to help alleviate the near-term impact of COVID-19 for our customers and our partners. These include extending flexible payment terms, offering customer-friendly downgrade alternatives and prepaying some partner commissions. As a result of these actions and the challenged economic environment, we saw a headwind to revenue retention beginning in mid-March. To give you some additional color, we saw our net revenue retention rate fall from over 100% through the first 2 months of the year to the low 90s in March, with the majority of the decline coming from customer downgrades versus cancellations. As you would expect, we saw a larger uptick in churn from customers in our 1- to 25-employee segment relative to our mid-market customers. Given the uncertain economic environment, and the continued impact of our customer-friendly programs, we anticipate our retention rates will trend lower in Q2. The remainder of my comments will refer to non-GAAP measures. First quarter gross margin was 82%, flat year-over-year. Subscription gross margin was 85%, while services gross margin was minus 3%. For the first quarter, operating margin was 7.3%, down slightly compared to the same period last year. Operating margins in the quarter exceeded our expectations as a result of strong revenue performance, higher software capitalization and some expense savings related to COVID-19. At the end of the first quarter, we had 3,578 employees, up 30% year-over-year. Like many businesses, in mid-March, we moved quickly to shift our entire workforce to a remote working environment to protect our employees and our communities. Prior to the pandemic, remote was already our third largest office, and I believe our systems and employees have adapted well. As a reminder, we plan for higher headcount growth in the first half of 2020 as a result of our strong hiring last fall. We continue to expect our headcount growth to begin to slow in the second half of the year. We plan to maintain high levels of investment in R&D in order to deliver on a robust product road map while slowing hiring in G&A and targeted sales and marketing functions to ensure continued financial flexibility. Net income in the first quarter was $16.7 million or $0.35 per diluted share. CapEx, including capitalized software development costs, was $16 million or 8% of revenue in the quarter, driven by the completion of our Dublin facility build out and higher capitalized software development costs related to product innovation. We continue to expect CapEx as a percentage of revenue to be about 7% in 2020. Free cash flow in the first quarter was $7 million or 4% of revenue. Free cash flow was negatively impacted by our $11 million partner commissions prepayment and the extended payment terms we offered to impacted customers. Given these factors, we now expect free cash flow of approximately $30 million for 2020. HubSpot ended the quarter with over $1 billion of cash and marketable securities, and is well positioned to weather this economic downturn. As we look to the future, we remain committed to our disciplined approach to managing expenses while continuing to invest for the long term. With that, let's dive into guidance for the second quarter and full year of 2020. For the second quarter, total revenue is expected to be in the range of $195 million to $196 million, up 20% year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be between $10.5 million and $11.5 million. Non-GAAP diluted net income per share is expected to be between $0.23 and $0.25. This assumes approximately 47.2 million fully diluted shares outstanding. And for the full year of 2020, total revenue is now expected to be in the range of $800 million to $810 million, up 19% year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating income is now expected to be between $40 million and $42 million. Non-GAAP diluted net income per share is now expected to be between $0.88 and $0.92. This assumes approximately 47.4 million fully diluted shares outstanding. Our guidance reflects a view of the business that we are comfortable with, given current economic conditions. Our outlook assumes a challenging economic environment through the second quarter and incorporate a wider range of outcomes to the second half of the year. As you adjust your models, keep in mind the following: we expect an increased foreign exchange headwind to as-reported revenue; at current spot rates, we're now expecting a headwind of 2 points in both Q2 and the full year 2020. With that, I'll hand the call back over to Brian for his closing remarks.\nBrian Halligan : Thanks, Kate. Like many of you, I've spent a lot of time over the past couple of months thinking about resilience. And I'm privileged beyond bounds to be part of the business that can still operate, be able to keep our team employed and our customers moving. Thankful for that every day. That feeling of gratitude also comes with a sense of drive and purpose. The only thing we can count on is that the world will look different on the other side of this. And when it does, I want our company to have been part of helping as many businesses as possible bend not break. Why we made the decisions we made over the last couple of months, and it's why we continue to invest and it's why I wake up every day with conviction. To our customers, our partners, our investors and all the HubSpotters around the globe who are in this fight with us, thank you. Operator, can we please open up the call for a few questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Stan Zlotsky from Morgan Stanley.\nStan Zlotsky: I'm glad to see everybody is staying safe and healthy. And JD, you will certainly be missed. So maybe just diving into the results, I think the biggest surprise that we're hearing thus far from investors is that you guys provided guidance for the full year. I don't think people are really expecting that. What gives you the confidence to provide that guidance considering that so many other companies will have pulled full year guidance? And then I have a quick follow-up.\nBrian Halligan: Kate, you want to take that one?\nKate Bueker: Sure. So yes, obviously, the current environment is a significant headwind for us. It's a significant headwind for everyone. It's frankly a bit unprecedented, and that was not lost on us as we were thinking through how to approach guidance and what scenarios we were running. For Q2, we are assuming that the economic environment remains weak throughout the quarter. We took a bunch of actions early on to help our customers and our partners. And those will have impacts on our Q2 results specifically. And while Brian alluded to the fact that new business has stabilized towards the end of April, we still expect continued pressure on the net new bookings from customer downgrades and to a lesser extent, some cancellations. As for the full year, we always consider a range of outcomes for our full year guidance. In this environment, that range of outcomes is obviously wider than it has been in the past. And I am not an economist. No one frankly knows when the recovery will happen and what it will look like. But our guidance reflects a view of the business that we're comfortable with today even if it takes a while for the recovery to start to materialize.\nStan Zlotsky: Okay. Perfect. And then a follow-up for Brian. Equally surprising was the commentary that you're seeing actually a tailwind from COVID impact because it's really forcing some customers to abandon their old traditional ways of marketing and really move to digital marketing with everything that's happening in the physical world. Where are you seeing that coming from? And really what's pushing customers to make that commitment now versus, hey, let's wait it out, let's wait 6 months until if things stabilize and then try to reassess?\nBrian Halligan: Thanks for the question, Stan. And to sort of take a step way back, it's sort of the tale of 3 cities here. First, 2.5 months at HubSpot, we were just cranking, really cranking, about as cranking as I can recall HubSpot. Starting in mid-March for about 3 weeks there, the real -- a mighty headwind in there, 200-mile in our headwind on the new business side and a big headwind on retention downgrade side. Around the second week of April, the last 3, 4 weeks, kind of the third phase of the year, where the headwind slowed a bit. The cancellations and the downgrades, kind of get back into the new normal. And then a tailwind kind of kicked off. And the tailwind, Stan, is -- there's sort of 2 pieces to that tailwind. One of it is what I talked about on the call, sort of business is moving from offline marketing to online marketing. It's a terrible time to be doing offline marketing right now. Moving from outbound to inbound, moving from outside sales to inside sales. Our value prop and our product pretty matches really well on the way people are going to want to go-to-market these days. The second tailwind, certain industries have benefited from COVID-19 like e-learning and medicine, things like that. And I remember, it's like the second to the last day in April, and I have a habit going through the list of orders we get every day, and there was one day, in particular, we had 2 big orders from Europe. One was from a company that's a remote MBA, you can get your MBA remotely, which as you can imagine, is serving here in pandemic environment. And the other one is the company that makes temperature scanners. Again, a company that's really surging and they made sizable orders on the same day. It kind of caught my eye that certainly, some industries are falling up, and some industries are picking up. So I would describe HubSpot as, in mid-March, just a giant headwind, 200-mile of headwind, no tailwind. Last 3 weeks though, the headwind has slowed down and the tailwind has picked up. So I'm feeling cautiously optimistic.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Alex Zukin from RBC Capital Markets.\nDylan Reider: It's Dylan Reider on for Alex. Could you speak a little bit to some of the customers where you are seeing heavier impact? The percent -- any quantification that you can give around a percent of your customers that are in those industries? And then just maybe some of the trends and dig into some of the details that you've seen with regards to alleviating customers and providing them with some flexibility as well as some of the trends around getting new -- converting new prospects as well.\nBrian Halligan: Great. I guess what I want you all to think about HubSpot, we have 3 segments. We have 2 to 20 employees, 20 to 200 employees, 200 to 2,000 employees. So people bucket it as same as SMB. I kind of think of it as more M than S. Our biggest segment is that 20 to 200 segment. That's kind of one thing to keep in mind as you think about small businesses and the impact. In terms of the industries, given what's going on, I've taken a new interest in what industries we're in and started to peel into it. We have very little exposure to some of the hardest hit industries like restaurants and stores, like the very -- kind of a very small percentage of our business are in kind of very small restaurants and stores. Airlines and cruises on the larger end, very little exposure to that. So one of the things that's always been good about HubSpot is people always ask me, what are your big verticals, what vertical are you in? And I always kind of chuckle and say, if you had a pie chart, the -- looked at verticals for but the other section of the pie chart would be the biggest. And it's actually serving us pretty well in these tough times.\nDylan Reider: Got it. That's helpful. And then earlier in the call, you guys spoke to the [Indiscernible] multiproduct customers. Could you maybe speak to some of the differences that you're seeing among your multiproduct customers and within your single product customers as well?\nBrian Halligan: Kate, do you want to take that?\nKate Bueker : Sure. So our multiproduct customer total ticked up again this quarter. We're close to 32,000 multiproduct customers. I think we've talked about in the past the core retention statistics for multiproduct customers tend to be a little bit better than for our single product customers. We have seen that as it relates to the churn characteristics continuing in the last couple of months.\nOperator: The next question comes from Arjun Bhatia from William Blair.\nArjun Bhatia: A quick one for me. It sounded like, Brian, you alluded to the first 2.5 months of the year going extremely well. Can you maybe just flesh out a little bit what was driving the acceleration in those first 2.5 months? And then the second part of the question is, as you look at April, is there any way to break down the trends between what's happening in Marketing Hub, which is not seat-based necessarily versus Sales Hub and Service Hub, which are priced more on a per seat basis.\nBrian Halligan: Maybe I take the first one, you take the second one, Kate?\nKate Bueker : Sure.\nBrian Halligan: Okay. I mean a lot of you have been with us for a long period of time. And last year, I think the wrap on last year was sort of a last year on the product side because there are no new hubs and not a lot of fancy new features. It's actually the exact opposite. It was probably our best product year we've ever had. We implemented this main sale methodology that really has worked, and it was a little bit of -- let's take a step back, so we could go faster 2 steps. And the product -- the infrastructure is much better, the security is much better, the speed is much better, the usability is much better. And we're just starting to see that at the beginning of this year. We're getting the 2 steps forward, where we relaunched that Marketing Hub Enterprise product, which went very well, a nice uptick on that, the reception was really good. You probably just saw that we announced CMS Hub a couple of weeks ago. And then while we're announcing new hubs and releasing lots of new kind of optimum functionality, actually, our Net Promoter Score was very high as ever. We're starting to like get into Apple-like range in some of our Net Promoter Scores. We're breaking records every month on that. So product team was really cranking. I think another thing that helped us was the go-to-market organization, had a good planning session last year and had caught up on hiring and was in much better shape coming into this year than last year. So I would say this is obviously disappointing, but I feel like we were really, really good shape coming into this crisis. And I think we're going to come out of this crisis in really good shape. A lot of the plays we've run kind of set us up so that when this thing is over, we're in really good stead to grow very fast.\nKate Bueker : And then if we look at retention characteristics across the hubs, what you're seeing is that the trends are relatively consistent across the hubs in our portfolio. If you -- again, sort of take a step back and look at retention in that first period of time that Brian talked about late March, what we saw really was an increase in both cancellations and downgrades over that period. It was maybe a little bit more downgrade specific, but both components were pretty significant. What we've seen going into April is that the trend is a little bit different. Retention statistics have fallen a little bit further than they were in March. But the composition of that is different. There is many more downgrades relative to cancellation. The seat rightsizing is one of those things that we are seeing among others. Many of them are -- of the downgrades are a result of the customer-friendly plays that we kicked off as we saw this unfold. So in Q2, we will see heavier downgrades versus cancellations. Hopefully, over time, a good portion of those customers will be able to grow back with us again.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Samad Samana from Jefferies.\nSamad Samana: My first question, just on the new bookings side. I'm curious how new bookings, how that shape has been from late March now into early May. And for the customers that are still booking HubSpot, is there any characteristics that are shared? Are they larger -- on the larger side, the smaller side? Any thoughts on new bookings would be helpful.\nBrian Halligan: Kate, do you want to take that?\nKate Bueker : Sure. I think that Brian kind of alluded to this in March, like sort of shut down. And the first of the segments of the business that picked up was that sort of smaller customer base. So that kind of sub 2 to 20 segment of our business. And I think it was just -- they were sort of faster to action, whereas that mid-market segment of our population really was much more at a holding pattern. And it wasn't until, call it the back half of April, where we started to see some movement in that part of our customer base. I think the one thing that I would note, and you'll see it as we potentially get into other areas is a lot of the customers that we're adding are smaller in terms of just sheer volume of new customer adds, we're seeing really healthy adds at that starter component. And we are adding customers with some much more flexible payment terms than we are used to seeing.\nSamad Samana: Great. And then, Kate, maybe a follow-up. If -- I guess if it's tough to tease out if you guys hadn't proactively provided the flexible payment terms and the flexible ability to downgrade. But I guess, how should we think about the -- with the inbound interest from customers wanting to downgrade versus what HubSpot proactively offered?\nKate Bueker : So I think if we look -- we've obviously been looking hard at this. And if we look at the volume of downgrades that we see relative to, call it, the normal course run rate, and we look at the -- one layer down underneath the kinds of downgrades, I would say probably a little more than half of the increased downgrades are associated with really the -- directly associated with the proactive plays that we are running and others are motions that would be more customer-driven.\nBrian Halligan: Let me add a little to that, Kate. One of our strategies here, Samad, was we wanted to -- we would far prefer someone downgrade than cancel, obviously, because we keep them in our system for longer. As this thing passes, they can upgrade down the road. So we kind of -- we made a decision to make it easier to downgrade, and we did that by, one, making our free CRM product richer. We added a whole bunch of cool new functionality in there like 1:1 meetings in video and box, so really help people get started for free. If you bought the starter suite product, we made that far less expensive, easier to downgrade to. And then we gave a lot of room to our front-line managers and contributors on the sales and service side that offer temporary discounts and downgrades to customers. We want to keep them in our system. We had an initial wave of that. That was a pretty good-sized headwind there for 3 weeks. People are -- the downgrades are still higher than they would be normally. But it's quieted down a little bit relative to that last few weeks. It's a little bit of our strategy of we want to be like a coiled spring. So we come into this thing, we don't waste the crisis. We try to provide a bunch of mechanisms to help our partners and customers weather it, and at the same time, when we come out of this, hopefully, they've weathered it nicely and they grow with us. But we've also got a lot of other new customers in the system, new free CRM users, new starter customers. And hopefully, it'll position us really well when this thing is over.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Chris Merwin from Goldman Sachs.\nChristopher Merwin: I just wanted to ask you about the new CMS Hub. I was just looking at the site and I didn't see a starter price there, but obviously, you've got pro and enterprise. So just thinking about who this is maybe geared toward and who some of those early adopters might be? Are the users slightly larger customers? Just curious. Anything you can say about the initial traction there?\nBrian Halligan: Sure. Let's talk a little bit about the CMS for a sec. We've had a content management system since very early days of HubSpot. It's always been an add on product. It's always done okay. It's had investment. About a year ago, we said, let's turn this add-on into a full baked awesome hubs. So we really ramped up our investment over the last year. And so what we did was turn this add-on and sort of lightly funded into a full hub. The existing add-on now is CMS Hub Pro, really much better than that add-on was, and then we added a CMS Hub Enterprise product that's really good, we're very excited about this. Now when I think about the CMS industry, it's actually a funny industry. You've got a choice. You can either buy a very light, very to easy to use, SaaS content management systems. There's a few of those on the market, 1 or 2 of them are public, so you probably know about them. Or you can buy a very heavy, pretty hard to use, oftentimes open source content management system where you're managing a lot of plug-ins, you've got a lot of security wares, you need a lot of developers. And it's been like the tiering of 4. You can have 1 or the other historically. And we just don't like that trade-off. We felt like it's a false trade-off. So what we've created is a content management system that has the ease of use with the rest of HubSpot's products but layers in that real power and capabilities of some of the heavier products. And so far it's so good. We're getting really good reception on the product. Our partners and customers are buying it. And I think it's going to be a big, big business for us down the road.\nChristopher Merwin: Great. And maybe just one follow-up for Kate. Just as it relates to that second half implied guidance. Anything you can say about some of the more specific assumptions you're making, I guess, maybe in particular, as it relates to gross revenue retention? I think you called out what that might be in or what it was in 1Q, but just thinking through what that might look like in the context of your guidance for the second half of the year.\nKate Bueker : Sure. So we obviously talked about March as being in the low 90s. We talked about Q2 as going down from there. I think we would assume that our retention statistics remain under pressure for a good part of the year, probably with Q2 being the low point and some modest improvement from there.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Siti Panigrahi from Mizuho.\nMichael Berg: You got Michael Berg here on for Siti. Just a quick question also on the growth starter suite. You noted that was 5x what it was previously. What can we think of as a general rule of thumb for how much of the general starter population is on the full suite now?\nBrian Halligan: Kate?\nKate Bueker : Yes. It's a good question. Historically, what we have seen is that the strength of starter ads has really been in that marketing starter product. And I think what you saw with the new price for the growth suite that we introduced in mid-month is like a material shift toward the new customer adoption of the growth suite. And I'm sure I'm going to hit the numbers exactly wrong, but it edge sort of closer over the last months to being more of a 50-50 ad across the suite and the marketing starter.\nMichael Berg: So customers -- so just for clarification, customers don't typically adjust the starter of sales or service, they do either marketing or the full suite of this juncture?\nKate Bueker : The marketing starter product has been a particularly popular product with a lot of real strong value, and that's where we've seen the -- like highest volume of ads over the recent history.\nMichael Berg: Okay. And then a quick follow-up on a similar note. When you're talking about the downgrades, obviously, there's a significant price reduction right now for the growth suite. Do you see people who are downgrading I mean, I guess, for any hub flow through the full suite? Or do they typically downgrade to the singular product?\nKate Bueker : So the downgrade can take a bunch of forms. I think the one that you're thinking about is, right, where you can have somebody who is on enterprise or professional addition, downgrade their addition to -- from enterprise to professional or professional to starter, you can also have people reduce the sort of volume of seats or contacts. There are other ways of downgrading as well like we've been helping with some customers with sort of near-term price point release. So there is a variety of things that end up hitting that downgrade number.\nMichael Berg: Okay. And then one last one on the same note. I think you've put some time frame on the reduced price for the gross suite. Are you thinking about that as for the next 12 months or so or until that retention rate? Or how should we think about how long the reduced price will be and then for both modeling purposes and for general, just a sense of how you will be pricing?\nBrian Halligan: I can take that. We're talking about that now. It's gone really well. We're kind of finding a new piece of the supply and demand curve. We haven't made decisions on it. So we'll keep you posted.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Mark Murphy from JPMorgan.\nMark Murphy: JD, I just want to say thanks for everything, all the best, and I hope you get in some great bonus fishing here over the summer. Brian, I wanted to ask you the comment about the headwind turning into a combo of a headwind and a tailwind in recent weeks. Are you kind of interpreting that as the worst is behind us? And also, if you could just clarify, are you conveying that bookings are getting all the way back to the original plan? Or does it kind of feel like more of a partial step on the way to recovery?\nBrian Halligan: Yes. More like a partial step, Mark. I kind of break it out in my head into new business coming in and then what's going on with the installed base. Tailwinds -- there's definitely a tailwind on the new business coming in now. We were super worried there for a few weeks, but it's coming back. The thing that's interesting about it is our marketing departments on fire, like our content marketing and inbound marketing strategy and the premium strategy are really paying off, where the lead flow has been great. And the leads we get out of the free CRM have been great and the academy has been on fire. So it's been good, and new deal creation has been good. It's been good. It's -- that's kind of bounced back pretty well. The -- on the other side, on the customer side, the numbers are going to be a little funny to look at because as we made it pretty attractive, the downgrades here. But the amount of downgrades and the attractiveness of those downgrades and the pace of it was really high there for 3 weeks. It's still higher than in a steady state pre-COVID, but it's come down off the highs. So I guess that's how I describe it.\nMark Murphy: Okay. And then as a follow-up for Kate, I'm just curious when do you see the trough in revenue growth? For instance, is it -- should we be looking at this kind of mid-teens growth in Q3, Q4 as a decent guess as of now?\nKate Bueker : Look, I think the true trough will reveal itself as the economy turns around. But I would say you should estimate that you would see declines over the next couple of quarters.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Ken Wong from Guggenheim Securities.\nKen Wong : Brian, can you maybe talk about the appetite of your customers to attach new hubs in this particular environment? Is that something that you guys are still able to move forward? Or is that something we have to wait maybe until we kind of clear this COVID fog?\nBrian Halligan: I haven't noticed anything particularly strange there. I would say that based on what I'm seeing, the CMS Hub attach has been pretty good. That new CMS Hub Enterprise products people are buying it. And so there's a desire to do it. I think companies are -- there's several things going on. One, they're coming to the conclusion that they knew they needed to do inbound marketing, they knew they needed to do inside sales, they knew they needed to do online marketing, and they knew that they needed to get great at it. And they are planning on doing it sometime in the next x years, they're having to do it now. So there's just some urgency around that. Combined with -- a couple of these industries are really growing and their budgets are increasing and they're moving a little more reducing. So that's kind of how what we're seeing out in the market, Ken.\nKen Wong : Got it. And Kate, maybe quickly, I know you guys look at subscription as a better reflection of your business, but any thoughts on how the billings growth rate might look like in this type of an environment?\nKate Bueker : Yes. A couple of thoughts there. So we've always talked about billings -- growth of -- billings growth and revenue growth in constant currency should kind of track each other. And you saw that happen in Q1. I think one of the things that drives the wedge between the growth in billings and the growth in revenue in constant currency is either expansion or contraction of billing terms, of payment terms. And we are definitely seeing a reduction in billing term. And so I would expect that in the next couple of quarters, you would see billings growth lag revenue growth in constant currency.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Terry Tillman from SunTrust.\nNick Negulic: This is actually Nick on for Terry. I was just hoping you guys could dig a little deeper on the net customer add in the quarter. I know you said it was primarily driven by the starter suite. But just any other color you provide there would be helpful.\nBrian Halligan: Kate, you want to take that?\nKate Bueker : Yes. Sure. So Q1 was a record quarter for us for new customer additions. It was almost 5,300. It's a high watermark for us. And it was really driven by that starter products. So we saw very strong additions in the marketing starter. We saw strong additions in the starter suite. We're continuing to see that happen through April. And so we're anticipating that we'll see another strong quarter of customer new adds in Q2. I think with that, I'd just caution us to look at the ASRPC and think about what's going to happen there. Given the strong growth at that low end, we would expect to see that be under pressure in the next quarter.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Tom Roderick from Stifel.\nTom Roderick : So Kate, can we just talk for a second about contract duration? And maybe what the mix of your customers look like? I noticed on your website, you've put a formal offer out there for, I think, what was a 20% discount for paying annually upfront. Could you give us a sense as to how many of your customers pay quarterly versus annually versus monthly? And then as we break that apart, for those customers that are downticking, I guess the thought behind the question is how soon do you sales reps get a chance to kind of get back in front of them and try to uptick them again once things get better?\nKate Bueker : So why don't I take the first part and then Brian can handle the sort of sales aspect of it. The -- you're asking a contract duration question. The reality is that most of our contracts are annual contracts outside of that starter tier. The difference is the billing terms. So we have customers that pay us for the full annual contract upfront. We have some that pay us quarterly. We have some that pay us monthly, those are, typically, those starter customers. And what we saw was that marketing billing has been this annual upfront payment. As we have gotten into the sales and service hub, those were typically more quarterly payment term products. And as our mix has shifted from marketing into sales and service, we've seen that payment duration come down. That's why you've seen the billings growth in constant currency kind of lags our revenue growth in constant currency over the last, I don't know, year to 18 months. We are seeing -- we are proactively being more flexible with payment terms during this period of economic pressure. And so you're going to see that on not just the Sales and Service Hub, but also in the Marketing Hub in the near term.\nBrian Halligan: Yes. And I would just add that it's the same theory on payment terms as we're doing on discounting, where if a customer comes to us who's impacted by COVID and saying, \"Gosh, we're just going to have a heck of a time with cash flows in the next 3 months.\" We will give them a discount. We want to keep them in our system, and we want to help them through it. And I suspect that will be going on for the next 3 to 6 months that, that we'll try to be generous there. And then down the road, we'll revisit it as their business improves and as the economy improves.\nTom Roderick : Yes. And Brian, just on the thought of sort of not knowing if this is going to be a 3, 6, 9-month type of deal in terms of how everybody is impacted. There is a real opportunity here for obviously, for HubSpot to put a good level of distance between some smaller competitors and really kind of step on the pedal. You grew headcount, I think, 30% this quarter. How are you thinking about your goals to continue to really invest aggressively? I don't know if you want to sort of lay out headcount goals for the year? Or anything you're thinking about with kind of a pause on headcount in the near term. But just take us through your thinking on when to put your foot back on the pedal for investments in the business, particularly sort of sales and marketing and go-to-market headcount?\nBrian Halligan: Sure. It's like Kate is saying earlier, no one knows what's going to happen with the economy. We're planning for U-shape recovery. And as part of that, we're continuing to hire. We want to hire. So really good shape on the other side of this thing. Most of our decisions have been made with that in mind. Maybe, if our foot is all the way down on the gas pedal, on the sales and marketing and G&A side, we got a little bit, think about the gas, a little on hiring. But the foot is all the way down on the gas pedal on the R&D side. That R&D organization made great progress last year and coming into this year, in really good shape. We feel like our vision of the value we can deliver for our customers is still early in the flight cycle. There's a lot more wood to chop there. So we're going to continue to invest. And hopefully, we're in great shape when we're on the other side of this thing.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Ryan MacDonald from Needham.\nRyan MacDonald : I don't want to get too far ahead of myself here. But in terms of the downgrades and sort of the favorable terms to help customers proactively downgrade and help them out, is there anything built into that -- into those terms that offers more favorable terms for them to -- when they're ready to upgrade again?\nBrian Halligan: Not really. The way we're structuring those is if you come to us and say, \"Hey, we're having a hard time.\" We'd say, \"Okay, let's structure a deal for you where we can discount you down x percent.\" And most them are structured that, that lasts for 90 days, and some are structured that it's more like 180 days. And then at the end of that, you come back to your price. If it's 90 days and someone comes back to it, so we get into 90 days and they say, \"Hey, we're really still struggling. Give us another 90 days, and we'll be in good shape.\" I'm quite sure we'll be flexible on that type of environment.\nRyan MacDonald : Excellent. And then just a follow-up. In terms of as you're looking -- look through April and starting to see, I don't know, the impact, whether it's worsening or improving. Are there any pockets or surprising pockets of strength or weakness that has sort of either improved quicker than expected or have remained worse than expected for longer?\nBrian Halligan: Yes. The way I would -- like if I think of the different segments of that 2 to 20 versus the 20 to 200, 200 to 2,000. The 2 to 20, I find it was very fast to react to all this stuff in mid-March. And they really froze their spending and a lot of them wanted to downgrade and cancel. The mid-market in corporate, just kind of -- they kind of froze. They didn't buy a lot more and they didn't downgrade or cancel at much rate. And the way I would describe it over the last 3 weeks, the small segment, the 2 to 20, they're starting to buy again and move faster and trying to react, they're still canceling at a higher rate than they were prior to COVID, but that has certainly slowed down. And that mid-market and corporate for us, that 20 to 200 or 200 to 2,000, they kind of be thought or unthought a little bit and they're starting to move and starting to buy. There's some downgrading, some cancellation going on there, but it's not as heavy as it was in the small business side. And I would just remind everyone that like if I look at those 3 segments, 2 to 20, 20 to 200, 200 to 2,000, the 20 to 200 is the heaviest segment for us. That's kind of our sweet spot and the largest chunk of our ARR.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Brian Peterson from Raymond James.\nKevin Ruth: Kevin here on for Brian. I'm curious what the uptake has been for some of the free tools you made available to customers over the past several weeks. And should we view that more as a bridge here in the near-term to help customers? Or do you think that could also serve as a potential expansion opportunity to you on the other side?\nBrian Halligan: That's a really good question. We were just talking about that the other day. It's been well received. People are using some of those new features, the box, the videos, collaboration features. So stay tuned. We'll make some decisions over the coming weeks as to whether we leave those down there or we put them back into the starter. It's a good question.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Brent Bracelin from Piper Sandler.\nParker Snook: This is Parker on for Brent. We've now seen several companies discuss material changes to marketing budgets as a result of COVID. Relative to the Marketing Hub, are there any features that you guys are kind of paving to? Can you help -- that can help offset some of the weaker marketing spends. And any color on how customers needs are kind of changing and impacts the land expand model for the small business customers?\nBrian Halligan: Yes. People are definitely buying our Marketing Hub now. They definitely slowed down for a few weeks, but they started buying again. Our marketing product really fits the times where we netted this idea of doing inbound marketing versus outbound marketing. Inbound marketing, we upgraded content, getting found in Google and social media and pulling people in, in a very low cost way. And so they're spending tons of money on advertising on TV or billboards or wherever you're advertising. Your success in inbound is much more about the width of your brain than the width of your wallet. So our value prop, I think, is very strongly based and fits the times. I mean, is it the same as it was before? Probably not. But I think people are going to be buying our marketing product as a cure for what's going on, not the other way around.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Kirk Materne from Evercore ISI.\nKirk Materne : Brian, I guess, are you seeing any differences with your customer base in terms of how they've reacted internationally versus the U.S.? Or even when you're looking at it on sort of a size range, it's pretty similar across different geographies. And maybe just how are you thinking about that going forward, if at all, if it's at all different.\nBrian Halligan: Yes, I think I'd kind of address the size. On international, it kind of hit the U.S. -- it kind of hit everywhere. Asia maybe a little bit before, but it hit everywhere. And it's sort of -- it all kind of wash through like 2 waves like I've been talking about. The one place where it hit particularly hard, and I think it will take longer to recover is in emerging markets, Lat Am and some of the smaller emerging markets. Those are markets we don't have a whole lot of exposure to. And so it's particularly painful for us, but it does look like those were hit harder and aren't rebounding as quickly as some of the other bigger markets.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Jennifer Lowe from UBS.\nJennifer Lowe: Great. First, I wanted to ask, so you mentioned that you were working to expediate commissions in the quarter to partners and giving them a 6 months advance if they ask for it. And just the natural question on that, can you just comment on sort of the health of your partner channel? I know HubSpot is a relatively small mix of their revenue overall. So is this something they're asking for? Are they concerned about their businesses? Or is this just a gesture of goodwill? Can you just talk a little bit about that?\nBrian Halligan: Yes. I think it was more -- it's a very good question, Jennifer. Proactive on our part in mid-March. We thought partners in small businesses. Most of our partners are relatively small firms. We've got some bigger ones, but the vast majority are relatively small. And we just wanted to make sure they have the cash flow, so they felt confident and could plow through what's going on here. We want them to continue to hire at least not lay off and continue to invest in their business. And we felt like that was very good for them. And over the long haul, I think that will be good for us. It's -- you lose us to have a healthy, cooperative, growing partner channel. So Kate, do you have anything to add to that?\nKate Bueker: Yes. No, I think it was highly -- it was very well received by our partners. We offered the commission's prepayment to our platinum and above, and the vast majority took us up on it.\nJennifer Lowe: I can imagine they did. And maybe just one more for me. It sounds -- I mean we talked about sort of the downdraft and how it affected all the hubs similarly or at least that was my interpretation of what you said earlier. But as you look at -- there's been a discussion around the interest in marketing, and it makes a lot of sense. Everyone's got to market digitally in the new world. But can you comment on Sales and Service Hubs and whether that has potentially seen a similar kind of uptick in interest? Or if there's differences in how those products are being received in the current environment?\nBrian Halligan: Yes. Initially, when I looked at this, I thought we'd see a big surge in marketing and the others would stay flat. But it's kind of been across the board where they all kind of went down at the same time, and they're all kind of coming up at the same time. The one that's coming up nicely that you would hope would come up nicely, is the CMS up the new hub getting nice reception. But it's been get [Indiscernible] consistent across all of them, there was an outlier in one direction or the other.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Koji Ikeda from Oppenheimer.\nKoji Ikeda: Just one quick one here on the guidance. I was wondering if you could dig into a little bit more on the full year on what you commented on the wider range of outcomes. I guess, how should we be thinking about the outcomes on the book ends of that guidance range? I mean, more specifically on the low end. Does the low end assume the macro bottoms in the second quarter and begins to recover from there? Or is the low end of the full year guide more like the macro bottom somewhere beyond the second quarter?\nKate Bueker: Yes. I think Brian talked a bit about the scenarios that we are running internally, bridging from this V-shape scenario that had a really sharp recovery. The U-shape scenario, which is our current operating assumption that says it takes just a bit longer to have the economy to get on back on track. And also this sort of L-shape, which envisions a longer period of economic recession. And we looked at all of those when we were thinking through and setting our guidance to make sure that we felt comfortable across sort of a variety of outcomes.\nOperator: And I will now turn the call back over to Brian Halligan for closing remarks.\nBrian Halligan: I hope all of you stay safe and stay healthy, and thanks for joining us on the call, and we'll talk to you next quarter.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Kate Bueker",
            "content": "Thanks, Brian. Let's turn to our first quarter financial results and our guidance for the second quarter and full year 2020. The first quarter revenue grew 33% year-over-year in constant currency and 31% as reported. Q1 subscription revenue grew 33% year-over-year, while services revenue grew 2% year-over-year, both on an as-reported basis. Domestic revenue grew 25% in Q1, while international revenue growth was 45% year-over-year in constant currency and 41% as reported. International revenue represented 42% of total revenue in Q1, up 3 points year-over-year. Deferred revenue as of the end of March was $242 million, a 25% increase year-over-year. Calculated billings was $207 million, up 30% year-over-year on an as-reported basis and 32% in constant currency. HubSpot ended the first quarter with 78,776 total customers, which was up 30% year-over-year. Customer net additions exceeded 5,000 for the first time, driven by a strength at the low end of our product portfolio, particularly in our starter suite. Average subscription revenue per customer in Q1 was $10,018, and up slightly, both sequentially and year-over-year. In addition to the proactive product changes Brian highlighted, we have also taken some important steps to help alleviate the near-term impact of COVID-19 for our customers and our partners. These include extending flexible payment terms, offering customer-friendly downgrade alternatives and prepaying some partner commissions. As a result of these actions and the challenged economic environment, we saw a headwind to revenue retention beginning in mid-March. To give you some additional color, we saw our net revenue retention rate fall from over 100% through the first 2 months of the year to the low 90s in March, with the majority of the decline coming from customer downgrades versus cancellations. As you would expect, we saw a larger uptick in churn from customers in our 1- to 25-employee segment relative to our mid-market customers. Given the uncertain economic environment, and the continued impact of our customer-friendly programs, we anticipate our retention rates will trend lower in Q2. The remainder of my comments will refer to non-GAAP measures. First quarter gross margin was 82%, flat year-over-year. Subscription gross margin was 85%, while services gross margin was minus 3%. For the first quarter, operating margin was 7.3%, down slightly compared to the same period last year. Operating margins in the quarter exceeded our expectations as a result of strong revenue performance, higher software capitalization and some expense savings related to COVID-19. At the end of the first quarter, we had 3,578 employees, up 30% year-over-year. Like many businesses, in mid-March, we moved quickly to shift our entire workforce to a remote working environment to protect our employees and our communities. Prior to the pandemic, remote was already our third largest office, and I believe our systems and employees have adapted well. As a reminder, we plan for higher headcount growth in the first half of 2020 as a result of our strong hiring last fall. We continue to expect our headcount growth to begin to slow in the second half of the year. We plan to maintain high levels of investment in R&D in order to deliver on a robust product road map while slowing hiring in G&A and targeted sales and marketing functions to ensure continued financial flexibility. Net income in the first quarter was $16.7 million or $0.35 per diluted share. CapEx, including capitalized software development costs, was $16 million or 8% of revenue in the quarter, driven by the completion of our Dublin facility build out and higher capitalized software development costs related to product innovation. We continue to expect CapEx as a percentage of revenue to be about 7% in 2020. Free cash flow in the first quarter was $7 million or 4% of revenue. Free cash flow was negatively impacted by our $11 million partner commissions prepayment and the extended payment terms we offered to impacted customers. Given these factors, we now expect free cash flow of approximately $30 million for 2020. HubSpot ended the quarter with over $1 billion of cash and marketable securities, and is well positioned to weather this economic downturn. As we look to the future, we remain committed to our disciplined approach to managing expenses while continuing to invest for the long term. With that, let's dive into guidance for the second quarter and full year of 2020. For the second quarter, total revenue is expected to be in the range of $195 million to $196 million, up 20% year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be between $10.5 million and $11.5 million. Non-GAAP diluted net income per share is expected to be between $0.23 and $0.25. This assumes approximately 47.2 million fully diluted shares outstanding. And for the full year of 2020, total revenue is now expected to be in the range of $800 million to $810 million, up 19% year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating income is now expected to be between $40 million and $42 million. Non-GAAP diluted net income per share is now expected to be between $0.88 and $0.92. This assumes approximately 47.4 million fully diluted shares outstanding. Our guidance reflects a view of the business that we are comfortable with, given current economic conditions. Our outlook assumes a challenging economic environment through the second quarter and incorporate a wider range of outcomes to the second half of the year. As you adjust your models, keep in mind the following: we expect an increased foreign exchange headwind to as-reported revenue; at current spot rates, we're now expecting a headwind of 2 points in both Q2 and the full year 2020. With that, I'll hand the call back over to Brian for his closing remarks. Sure. So yes, obviously, the current environment is a significant headwind for us. It's a significant headwind for everyone. It's frankly a bit unprecedented, and that was not lost on us as we were thinking through how to approach guidance and what scenarios we were running. For Q2, we are assuming that the economic environment remains weak throughout the quarter. We took a bunch of actions early on to help our customers and our partners. And those will have impacts on our Q2 results specifically. And while Brian alluded to the fact that new business has stabilized towards the end of April, we still expect continued pressure on the net new bookings from customer downgrades and to a lesser extent, some cancellations. As for the full year, we always consider a range of outcomes for our full year guidance. In this environment, that range of outcomes is obviously wider than it has been in the past. And I am not an economist. No one frankly knows when the recovery will happen and what it will look like. But our guidance reflects a view of the business that we're comfortable with today even if it takes a while for the recovery to start to materialize. Sure. So our multiproduct customer total ticked up again this quarter. We're close to 32,000 multiproduct customers. I think we've talked about in the past the core retention statistics for multiproduct customers tend to be a little bit better than for our single product customers. We have seen that as it relates to the churn characteristics continuing in the last couple of months. Sure. And then if we look at retention characteristics across the hubs, what you're seeing is that the trends are relatively consistent across the hubs in our portfolio. If you -- again, sort of take a step back and look at retention in that first period of time that Brian talked about late March, what we saw really was an increase in both cancellations and downgrades over that period. It was maybe a little bit more downgrade specific, but both components were pretty significant. What we've seen going into April is that the trend is a little bit different. Retention statistics have fallen a little bit further than they were in March. But the composition of that is different. There is many more downgrades relative to cancellation. The seat rightsizing is one of those things that we are seeing among others. Many of them are -- of the downgrades are a result of the customer-friendly plays that we kicked off as we saw this unfold. So in Q2, we will see heavier downgrades versus cancellations. Hopefully, over time, a good portion of those customers will be able to grow back with us again. Sure. I think that Brian kind of alluded to this in March, like sort of shut down. And the first of the segments of the business that picked up was that sort of smaller customer base. So that kind of sub 2 to 20 segment of our business. And I think it was just -- they were sort of faster to action, whereas that mid-market segment of our population really was much more at a holding pattern. And it wasn't until, call it the back half of April, where we started to see some movement in that part of our customer base. I think the one thing that I would note, and you'll see it as we potentially get into other areas is a lot of the customers that we're adding are smaller in terms of just sheer volume of new customer adds, we're seeing really healthy adds at that starter component. And we are adding customers with some much more flexible payment terms than we are used to seeing. So I think if we look -- we've obviously been looking hard at this. And if we look at the volume of downgrades that we see relative to, call it, the normal course run rate, and we look at the -- one layer down underneath the kinds of downgrades, I would say probably a little more than half of the increased downgrades are associated with really the -- directly associated with the proactive plays that we are running and others are motions that would be more customer-driven. Sure. So we obviously talked about March as being in the low 90s. We talked about Q2 as going down from there. I think we would assume that our retention statistics remain under pressure for a good part of the year, probably with Q2 being the low point and some modest improvement from there. Yes. It's a good question. Historically, what we have seen is that the strength of starter ads has really been in that marketing starter product. And I think what you saw with the new price for the growth suite that we introduced in mid-month is like a material shift toward the new customer adoption of the growth suite. And I'm sure I'm going to hit the numbers exactly wrong, but it edge sort of closer over the last months to being more of a 50-50 ad across the suite and the marketing starter. The marketing starter product has been a particularly popular product with a lot of real strong value, and that's where we've seen the -- like highest volume of ads over the recent history. So the downgrade can take a bunch of forms. I think the one that you're thinking about is, right, where you can have somebody who is on enterprise or professional addition, downgrade their addition to -- from enterprise to professional or professional to starter, you can also have people reduce the sort of volume of seats or contacts. There are other ways of downgrading as well like we've been helping with some customers with sort of near-term price point release. So there is a variety of things that end up hitting that downgrade number. Look, I think the true trough will reveal itself as the economy turns around. But I would say you should estimate that you would see declines over the next couple of quarters. Yes. A couple of thoughts there. So we've always talked about billings -- growth of -- billings growth and revenue growth in constant currency should kind of track each other. And you saw that happen in Q1. I think one of the things that drives the wedge between the growth in billings and the growth in revenue in constant currency is either expansion or contraction of billing terms, of payment terms. And we are definitely seeing a reduction in billing term. And so I would expect that in the next couple of quarters, you would see billings growth lag revenue growth in constant currency. Yes. Sure. So Q1 was a record quarter for us for new customer additions. It was almost 5,300. It's a high watermark for us. And it was really driven by that starter products. So we saw very strong additions in the marketing starter. We saw strong additions in the starter suite. We're continuing to see that happen through April. And so we're anticipating that we'll see another strong quarter of customer new adds in Q2. I think with that, I'd just caution us to look at the ASRPC and think about what's going to happen there. Given the strong growth at that low end, we would expect to see that be under pressure in the next quarter. So why don't I take the first part and then Brian can handle the sort of sales aspect of it. The -- you're asking a contract duration question. The reality is that most of our contracts are annual contracts outside of that starter tier. The difference is the billing terms. So we have customers that pay us for the full annual contract upfront. We have some that pay us quarterly. We have some that pay us monthly, those are, typically, those starter customers. And what we saw was that marketing billing has been this annual upfront payment. As we have gotten into the sales and service hub, those were typically more quarterly payment term products. And as our mix has shifted from marketing into sales and service, we've seen that payment duration come down. That's why you've seen the billings growth in constant currency kind of lags our revenue growth in constant currency over the last, I don't know, year to 18 months. We are seeing -- we are proactively being more flexible with payment terms during this period of economic pressure. And so you're going to see that on not just the Sales and Service Hub, but also in the Marketing Hub in the near term. Yes. No, I think it was highly -- it was very well received by our partners. We offered the commission's prepayment to our platinum and above, and the vast majority took us up on it. Yes. I think Brian talked a bit about the scenarios that we are running internally, bridging from this V-shape scenario that had a really sharp recovery. The U-shape scenario, which is our current operating assumption that says it takes just a bit longer to have the economy to get on back on track. And also this sort of L-shape, which envisions a longer period of economic recession. And we looked at all of those when we were thinking through and setting our guidance to make sure that we felt comfortable across sort of a variety of outcomes."

            "name": "Brian Halligan",
            "content": "Thanks, Chuck. Good afternoon, folks. Thank you for joining us today. We're on this call to talk about HubSpot's business, but I want to take a moment to recognize the toll this pandemic has taken on so many people around the globe and closer to home right here in the HubSpot community. These are tough times. I hope all of you on the call are staying healthy and managing through this as well as you can. Now let's talk about HubSpot's first quarter earnings results. We came into this year with strong tailwinds. Constant currency revenue growth was 33% in Q1, and non-GAAP operating margins were just over 7%. Total customers grew 30% year-over-year, surpassing 78,000, while multiproduct adoption continued to grow nicely, representing nearly 32,000 customers. On the product front, we kicked off the year with an exciting relaunch of the enterprise tier for Marketing Hub. Marketing Hub Enterprise has always been easy to use, but the relaunch made it more powerful than ever before, with better attribution reporting, account-based marketing, advanced chat targeting and much more. We have an excellent offering that delivers great value to our enterprise segment now, and that's borne out by customer use. This product is 1 in 6 separate enterprise categories from G2, the main peer-based software review set. Now those tailwinds, they continued through much of the first quarter. However, in the middle of March, they were met by strong headwinds as the world felt the impact of the pandemic. Now rather than fight against that wind, we're trying to move with it through a series of plays designed to help our customers and partners reach the gap to better times. When the health crisis hit, our immediate focus turned to helping our customers and partners navigate this sudden economic downturn. With that in mind, we expedited Q1 commissions to all solutions partners, and we offered a 6-month commission prepayment to platinum, diamond and elite partners. To help customers and prospects, meaning to rapidly move their go-to-market strategies online, we took several steps. We lifted e-mail and calling limits and added a collection of features, including meetings, bots and 1:1 video into our free CRM. We also reduced the price of our starter growth suite by over 50% late in the quarter. We did this to alleviate the financial strain for our customers on the starter products and to enable more companies under financial strain to get started with HubSpot. This resulted in a fivefold increase in the run rate of that offering at the end of the quarter. Finally, we gave our team a lot of leeway to offer discounts and flexible payment terms to certain customers under more severe short-term financial strain. The way I like to think about the pandemic for HubSpot is that it's like a big storm that blew into our business in the middle of March. The first few weeks, it's largely just a big 200-mile an hour headwind that hit the new business and retention side of our business at the same time. But over the last few weeks of April, the winds have shifted. I'd say we have 150-mile an hour headwind now, but that's coupled with 100-mile an hour tailwind as business has been picking up. And when I take a step back, that tailwind makes sense. The world is seeing a surge of companies with historically offline, old school go-to-market models leaning into a new school online go-to-market models for the first time. The very platform we sell and methodology we teach was designed to help companies make this shift. These trends represent a long-term tailwind for HubSpot, and I think it's one that will outlast the near-term volatility that we're all experiencing in the current downturn. We have not stopped building for the future. In April, we introduced a new product line, CMS Hub. Similar to Marketing Hub Enterprise, we wanted to combine the ease of use growing companies want with the power they need. The result was the content management system designed to help growing businesses overcome the notoriously painful experience of managing websites at scale. Many companies think they only have 2 options for managing their websites at basic CMS with very limited functionality or a technically complicated one with tons of administrative pains. CMS Hub is a better fit for growing companies that need features like dynamic content, adaptive testing and 24/7 security monitoring. And even some tooling, it starts to blur the gap between websites and web apps all without the heavy maintenance. We've been really pleased to see the positive reception that CMS has had with our customers and our partners despite the macro environment. In fact, given this rare moment in the history when humans are shifted into creating digital experiences that rival in-person ones, CMS Hub might have come along at just the right time. As I said before, these are indeed tough times. Having said that, HubSpot is in a good position to help our customers in the market with large weathered but tough times and come out stronger on the other side. To that end, we're continuing to invest and innovate, and we expect to be in an even stronger position when we come out the other side. Now before I hand it over, I want to share some news that our longtime President and Chief Operating Officer, JD Sherman, has decided to leave HubSpot. JD has been instrumental in driving HubSpot's global growth over the last 8 years and has left an indelible imprint on our customers, partners and employees. JD will stay on until July 1 and will continue as an adviser until the end of the year. He will leave behind a well-oiled operating system and a world-class team that will serve us exceptionally well in the years to come. While I'm sad to see him go, I'm proud of the work we've done and eager to see him become a great CEO wherever he lands. So on behalf of HubSpot, the Board of Directors and our employees around the world, I want to say thank you, JD. We've all grown better because of you. Okay. With that, I'll turn it over to Kate now to take us through the financials and our guidance. Thanks, Kate. Like many of you, I've spent a lot of time over the past couple of months thinking about resilience. And I'm privileged beyond bounds to be part of the business that can still operate, be able to keep our team employed and our customers moving. Thankful for that every day. That feeling of gratitude also comes with a sense of drive and purpose. The only thing we can count on is that the world will look different on the other side of this. And when it does, I want our company to have been part of helping as many businesses as possible bend not break. Why we made the decisions we made over the last couple of months, and it's why we continue to invest and it's why I wake up every day with conviction. To our customers, our partners, our investors and all the HubSpotters around the globe who are in this fight with us, thank you. Operator, can we please open up the call for a few questions. Kate, you want to take that one? Thanks for the question, Stan. And to sort of take a step way back, it's sort of the tale of 3 cities here. First, 2.5 months at HubSpot, we were just cranking, really cranking, about as cranking as I can recall HubSpot. Starting in mid-March for about 3 weeks there, the real -- a mighty headwind in there, 200-mile in our headwind on the new business side and a big headwind on retention downgrade side. Around the second week of April, the last 3, 4 weeks, kind of the third phase of the year, where the headwind slowed a bit. The cancellations and the downgrades, kind of get back into the new normal. And then a tailwind kind of kicked off. And the tailwind, Stan, is -- there's sort of 2 pieces to that tailwind. One of it is what I talked about on the call, sort of business is moving from offline marketing to online marketing. It's a terrible time to be doing offline marketing right now. Moving from outbound to inbound, moving from outside sales to inside sales. Our value prop and our product pretty matches really well on the way people are going to want to go-to-market these days. The second tailwind, certain industries have benefited from COVID-19 like e-learning and medicine, things like that. And I remember, it's like the second to the last day in April, and I have a habit going through the list of orders we get every day, and there was one day, in particular, we had 2 big orders from Europe. One was from a company that's a remote MBA, you can get your MBA remotely, which as you can imagine, is serving here in pandemic environment. And the other one is the company that makes temperature scanners. Again, a company that's really surging and they made sizable orders on the same day. It kind of caught my eye that certainly, some industries are falling up, and some industries are picking up. So I would describe HubSpot as, in mid-March, just a giant headwind, 200-mile of headwind, no tailwind. Last 3 weeks though, the headwind has slowed down and the tailwind has picked up. So I'm feeling cautiously optimistic. Great. I guess what I want you all to think about HubSpot, we have 3 segments. We have 2 to 20 employees, 20 to 200 employees, 200 to 2,000 employees. So people bucket it as same as SMB. I kind of think of it as more M than S. Our biggest segment is that 20 to 200 segment. That's kind of one thing to keep in mind as you think about small businesses and the impact. In terms of the industries, given what's going on, I've taken a new interest in what industries we're in and started to peel into it. We have very little exposure to some of the hardest hit industries like restaurants and stores, like the very -- kind of a very small percentage of our business are in kind of very small restaurants and stores. Airlines and cruises on the larger end, very little exposure to that. So one of the things that's always been good about HubSpot is people always ask me, what are your big verticals, what vertical are you in? And I always kind of chuckle and say, if you had a pie chart, the -- looked at verticals for but the other section of the pie chart would be the biggest. And it's actually serving us pretty well in these tough times. Kate, do you want to take that? Maybe I take the first one, you take the second one, Kate? Okay. I mean a lot of you have been with us for a long period of time. And last year, I think the wrap on last year was sort of a last year on the product side because there are no new hubs and not a lot of fancy new features. It's actually the exact opposite. It was probably our best product year we've ever had. We implemented this main sale methodology that really has worked, and it was a little bit of -- let's take a step back, so we could go faster 2 steps. And the product -- the infrastructure is much better, the security is much better, the speed is much better, the usability is much better. And we're just starting to see that at the beginning of this year. We're getting the 2 steps forward, where we relaunched that Marketing Hub Enterprise product, which went very well, a nice uptick on that, the reception was really good. You probably just saw that we announced CMS Hub a couple of weeks ago. And then while we're announcing new hubs and releasing lots of new kind of optimum functionality, actually, our Net Promoter Score was very high as ever. We're starting to like get into Apple-like range in some of our Net Promoter Scores. We're breaking records every month on that. So product team was really cranking. I think another thing that helped us was the go-to-market organization, had a good planning session last year and had caught up on hiring and was in much better shape coming into this year than last year. So I would say this is obviously disappointing, but I feel like we were really, really good shape coming into this crisis. And I think we're going to come out of this crisis in really good shape. A lot of the plays we've run kind of set us up so that when this thing is over, we're in really good stead to grow very fast. Kate, do you want to take that? Let me add a little to that, Kate. One of our strategies here, Samad, was we wanted to -- we would far prefer someone downgrade than cancel, obviously, because we keep them in our system for longer. As this thing passes, they can upgrade down the road. So we kind of -- we made a decision to make it easier to downgrade, and we did that by, one, making our free CRM product richer. We added a whole bunch of cool new functionality in there like 1:1 meetings in video and box, so really help people get started for free. If you bought the starter suite product, we made that far less expensive, easier to downgrade to. And then we gave a lot of room to our front-line managers and contributors on the sales and service side that offer temporary discounts and downgrades to customers. We want to keep them in our system. We had an initial wave of that. That was a pretty good-sized headwind there for 3 weeks. People are -- the downgrades are still higher than they would be normally. But it's quieted down a little bit relative to that last few weeks. It's a little bit of our strategy of we want to be like a coiled spring. So we come into this thing, we don't waste the crisis. We try to provide a bunch of mechanisms to help our partners and customers weather it, and at the same time, when we come out of this, hopefully, they've weathered it nicely and they grow with us. But we've also got a lot of other new customers in the system, new free CRM users, new starter customers. And hopefully, it'll position us really well when this thing is over. Sure. Let's talk a little bit about the CMS for a sec. We've had a content management system since very early days of HubSpot. It's always been an add on product. It's always done okay. It's had investment. About a year ago, we said, let's turn this add-on into a full baked awesome hubs. So we really ramped up our investment over the last year. And so what we did was turn this add-on and sort of lightly funded into a full hub. The existing add-on now is CMS Hub Pro, really much better than that add-on was, and then we added a CMS Hub Enterprise product that's really good, we're very excited about this. Now when I think about the CMS industry, it's actually a funny industry. You've got a choice. You can either buy a very light, very to easy to use, SaaS content management systems. There's a few of those on the market, 1 or 2 of them are public, so you probably know about them. Or you can buy a very heavy, pretty hard to use, oftentimes open source content management system where you're managing a lot of plug-ins, you've got a lot of security wares, you need a lot of developers. And it's been like the tiering of 4. You can have 1 or the other historically. And we just don't like that trade-off. We felt like it's a false trade-off. So what we've created is a content management system that has the ease of use with the rest of HubSpot's products but layers in that real power and capabilities of some of the heavier products. And so far it's so good. We're getting really good reception on the product. Our partners and customers are buying it. And I think it's going to be a big, big business for us down the road. Kate? I can take that. We're talking about that now. It's gone really well. We're kind of finding a new piece of the supply and demand curve. We haven't made decisions on it. So we'll keep you posted. Yes. More like a partial step, Mark. I kind of break it out in my head into new business coming in and then what's going on with the installed base. Tailwinds -- there's definitely a tailwind on the new business coming in now. We were super worried there for a few weeks, but it's coming back. The thing that's interesting about it is our marketing departments on fire, like our content marketing and inbound marketing strategy and the premium strategy are really paying off, where the lead flow has been great. And the leads we get out of the free CRM have been great and the academy has been on fire. So it's been good, and new deal creation has been good. It's been good. It's -- that's kind of bounced back pretty well. The -- on the other side, on the customer side, the numbers are going to be a little funny to look at because as we made it pretty attractive, the downgrades here. But the amount of downgrades and the attractiveness of those downgrades and the pace of it was really high there for 3 weeks. It's still higher than in a steady state pre-COVID, but it's come down off the highs. So I guess that's how I describe it. I haven't noticed anything particularly strange there. I would say that based on what I'm seeing, the CMS Hub attach has been pretty good. That new CMS Hub Enterprise products people are buying it. And so there's a desire to do it. I think companies are -- there's several things going on. One, they're coming to the conclusion that they knew they needed to do inbound marketing, they knew they needed to do inside sales, they knew they needed to do online marketing, and they knew that they needed to get great at it. And they are planning on doing it sometime in the next x years, they're having to do it now. So there's just some urgency around that. Combined with -- a couple of these industries are really growing and their budgets are increasing and they're moving a little more reducing. So that's kind of how what we're seeing out in the market, Ken. Kate, you want to take that? Yes. And I would just add that it's the same theory on payment terms as we're doing on discounting, where if a customer comes to us who's impacted by COVID and saying, \"Gosh, we're just going to have a heck of a time with cash flows in the next 3 months.\" We will give them a discount. We want to keep them in our system, and we want to help them through it. And I suspect that will be going on for the next 3 to 6 months that, that we'll try to be generous there. And then down the road, we'll revisit it as their business improves and as the economy improves. Sure. It's like Kate is saying earlier, no one knows what's going to happen with the economy. We're planning for U-shape recovery. And as part of that, we're continuing to hire. We want to hire. So really good shape on the other side of this thing. Most of our decisions have been made with that in mind. Maybe, if our foot is all the way down on the gas pedal, on the sales and marketing and G&A side, we got a little bit, think about the gas, a little on hiring. But the foot is all the way down on the gas pedal on the R&D side. That R&D organization made great progress last year and coming into this year, in really good shape. We feel like our vision of the value we can deliver for our customers is still early in the flight cycle. There's a lot more wood to chop there. So we're going to continue to invest. And hopefully, we're in great shape when we're on the other side of this thing. Not really. The way we're structuring those is if you come to us and say, \"Hey, we're having a hard time.\" We'd say, \"Okay, let's structure a deal for you where we can discount you down x percent.\" And most them are structured that, that lasts for 90 days, and some are structured that it's more like 180 days. And then at the end of that, you come back to your price. If it's 90 days and someone comes back to it, so we get into 90 days and they say, \"Hey, we're really still struggling. Give us another 90 days, and we'll be in good shape.\" I'm quite sure we'll be flexible on that type of environment. Yes. The way I would -- like if I think of the different segments of that 2 to 20 versus the 20 to 200, 200 to 2,000. The 2 to 20, I find it was very fast to react to all this stuff in mid-March. And they really froze their spending and a lot of them wanted to downgrade and cancel. The mid-market in corporate, just kind of -- they kind of froze. They didn't buy a lot more and they didn't downgrade or cancel at much rate. And the way I would describe it over the last 3 weeks, the small segment, the 2 to 20, they're starting to buy again and move faster and trying to react, they're still canceling at a higher rate than they were prior to COVID, but that has certainly slowed down. And that mid-market and corporate for us, that 20 to 200 or 200 to 2,000, they kind of be thought or unthought a little bit and they're starting to move and starting to buy. There's some downgrading, some cancellation going on there, but it's not as heavy as it was in the small business side. And I would just remind everyone that like if I look at those 3 segments, 2 to 20, 20 to 200, 200 to 2,000, the 20 to 200 is the heaviest segment for us. That's kind of our sweet spot and the largest chunk of our ARR. That's a really good question. We were just talking about that the other day. It's been well received. People are using some of those new features, the box, the videos, collaboration features. So stay tuned. We'll make some decisions over the coming weeks as to whether we leave those down there or we put them back into the starter. It's a good question. Yes. People are definitely buying our Marketing Hub now. They definitely slowed down for a few weeks, but they started buying again. Our marketing product really fits the times where we netted this idea of doing inbound marketing versus outbound marketing. Inbound marketing, we upgraded content, getting found in Google and social media and pulling people in, in a very low cost way. And so they're spending tons of money on advertising on TV or billboards or wherever you're advertising. Your success in inbound is much more about the width of your brain than the width of your wallet. So our value prop, I think, is very strongly based and fits the times. I mean, is it the same as it was before? Probably not. But I think people are going to be buying our marketing product as a cure for what's going on, not the other way around. Yes, I think I'd kind of address the size. On international, it kind of hit the U.S. -- it kind of hit everywhere. Asia maybe a little bit before, but it hit everywhere. And it's sort of -- it all kind of wash through like 2 waves like I've been talking about. The one place where it hit particularly hard, and I think it will take longer to recover is in emerging markets, Lat Am and some of the smaller emerging markets. Those are markets we don't have a whole lot of exposure to. And so it's particularly painful for us, but it does look like those were hit harder and aren't rebounding as quickly as some of the other bigger markets. Yes. I think it was more -- it's a very good question, Jennifer. Proactive on our part in mid-March. We thought partners in small businesses. Most of our partners are relatively small firms. We've got some bigger ones, but the vast majority are relatively small. And we just wanted to make sure they have the cash flow, so they felt confident and could plow through what's going on here. We want them to continue to hire at least not lay off and continue to invest in their business. And we felt like that was very good for them. And over the long haul, I think that will be good for us. It's -- you lose us to have a healthy, cooperative, growing partner channel. So Kate, do you have anything to add to that? Yes. Initially, when I looked at this, I thought we'd see a big surge in marketing and the others would stay flat. But it's kind of been across the board where they all kind of went down at the same time, and they're all kind of coming up at the same time. The one that's coming up nicely that you would hope would come up nicely, is the CMS up the new hub getting nice reception. But it's been get [Indiscernible] consistent across all of them, there was an outlier in one direction or the other. I hope all of you stay safe and stay healthy, and thanks for joining us on the call, and we'll talk to you next quarter."

Now it's my pleasure to turn over the call to HubSpot's Chief Executive Officer, Yamini Rangan. Yamini?\nYamini Rangan: Thank you so much, Chuck, and welcome, everyone. Thank you for joining us as we review HubSpot's fourth quarter and full year 2021 results. Last year was one of immense change, and I'm incredibly proud of how the HubSpot team was able to adapt and execute to meet the needs of our customers. Going into 2021, our goal was to be the number 1 CRM platform for scaling companies. We made significant progress towards that goal, and you can see that in our results. We have continued to see broad-based strength across the business with revenue growing 47% year-over-year in constant currency in the fourth quarter. We closed out 2021 with more than 135,000 customers globally, nearly $1.5 billion in ARR, and we generated more than $200 million of free cash flow. We also recently hit the exciting milestone of having more than 1,000 apps available in our marketplace. We know the customers who use integrations are more successful, and so having a robust ecosystem is essential to delivering on our platform vision. Now I want to take a step back and look at the macro trends that drove our sustained growth in 2021. Since HubSpot's inception, we have evangelized the shift towards digital transformation. That shift accelerated as small and medium businesses around the world have had to quickly pivot to doing business online. In this world of rapid digital transformation, providing a remarkable customer experience has gone from being a competitive advantage to being a necessity. Now more than ever, businesses need a modern and powerful CRM that helps them create those experiences. And HubSpot is becoming a CRM provider of choice for these SMBs as they navigate this journey. We did 2 things exceptionally well in 2021: we drove product innovation, and we aligned our product and go-to-market functions for tight execution. First, let's talk about product innovation. We both innovated on our anchor hubs and expanded our CRM platform with new product offerings. Operations Hub, which we launched in April, is one of those new products. This new hub meets the needs of operations teams struggling to get clean data, automate that data, report on that data and drive insights to help their businesses grow. Through Operations Hub, revenue operations teams have access to more than 100 native integrations that bring even more data into HubSpot to make it very powerful. Operations Hub supercharges the HubSpot CRM and drives more value, and we are seeing that in the numbers. We surpassed more than 15,000 customers using Operations Hub in Q4 and are seeing strong demand among both existing customers and new customers adopting it as part of our CRM suite. We also introduced a new lever for growth with payments and commerce and believe that commerce-enabled CRM can drive growth for our customers. I'm really thrilled to share that HubSpot Payments is now available to all U.S. customers, with our target segment being companies with fewer than 100 employees. Customer feedback is validating our hypothesis that a commerce solution is much more powerful when it's natively built inside of a CRM. We know that native payments are widely important for SMBs to grow their businesses online, particularly when it comes to having commerce context embedded in CRM. This actually ensures that all front-office teams have visibility into their interactions with the customer. While it's very early days, we're encouraged by the momentum we're seeing with our payments offering. In addition to launching new products, we have continued to invest in our anchor hubs of Marketing, Sales and Service. We extended our lead in CRM and drove sustained growth with new enterprise-level features platform-wide. Getting insights across the entire front office is still a huge challenge for many scaling companies. They're forced to use siloed, disparate systems that don't give them the visibility they need to grow their business. The improvements we made in 2021 are helping to solve those challenges, particularly when customers adopt multiple hubs. Multi-hub adoption now accounts for 60% of our customer base compared to 34% in 2017, which is a powerful indicator that our customers are seeing value in adopting HubSpot across multiple parts of their business. Take a look at ResellerRatings, a user-generated content platform for retail brands. Like many scaling companies, they were bogged down with a disparate stack of multiple front-office tools that did not provide visibility across the business. So their marketing and sales teams consolidated all of their work on HubSpot and saw a 25% increase in traffic, 30% increase in contract value and a 75% decrease in customer churn rate. This is exactly what we expect to see when customers adopt our CRM suite. ResellerRatings is creating better experience for their customers and scaling with HubSpot. Now let's shift gears to talk about the alignment between product and go-to-market and how that drove great execution in 2021. Our sweet spot historically has been the 20- to 200-employee segment. Last year, we set out to optimize the customer experience across all 3 key segments in which we operate. At the lower end, we're providing a full suite that is easy to use and easy to buy, and we are driving better experience through touchless and chat-assisted sales. We're making it seamless for customers to adopt our product, and we see that within our suite momentum. At the higher end of the market, we've continued to invest significantly in internal enablement initiatives that are driving higher sales productivity. We're also working to strengthen the alignment between inside sales and our solutions partners, and we're seeing momentum there. The process rigor that we have is enabling our sales team to better communicate the value of HubSpot and win higher-value, higher-ASP, upmarket deals that contributed to the strong results we saw across the year. As I look back on our accomplishments in 2021, we made remarkable progress on our path to becoming the CRM platform of choice for scaling companies. Small and medium businesses need great front-office solutions that can provide insights to drive growth. That increase mean, coupled with our product innovation and go-to-market execution, gives us a solid foundation for strong growth in 2022. Looking to this year, we're going to stay focused on the 4 strategic priorities that I outlined at the Analyst Day. Our first priority is to deliver a world-class, front-office platform by continuing to invest in new and existing hubs as well as driving extensibility of that platform. Our second strategic priority is to strengthen our segmentation approach across product and go-to-market. We will continue to deliver consumer-grade experiences with powerful enterprise-grade features. That will translate into a focus on driving broad suite adoption at the starter tier while enabling customers to gain more value from professional and enterprise tiers. Our third strategic priority is to invest in payments and commerce. We will be laser-focused on driving full adoption through the entire customer journey from payment discovery to transaction. We will also look to increase the volume that merchants transact in the product. Finally, our priority is to build a sustainable company. We'll do that by hiring and developing diverse talent adopting and reporting on environmentally sustainable practices and investing in data privacy solutions that build customer trust. I am really excited about the opportunity ahead and the investments we're making in 2022 to execute towards that opportunity. With that, I'll hand it over to Kate to discuss our financial results. Kate?\nKate Bueker: Thanks, Yamini. Let's turn to our fourth quarter and full year 2021 financial results. Fourth quarter revenue grew 47% year-over-year both in constant currency and on an as-reported basis. Q4 subscription revenue grew 47% year-over-year, while services and other revenue increased 38%, both on an as-reported basis. Full year 2021 revenue grew 45% year-over-year in constant currency and 47% as reported. Full year subscription revenue grew 48% year-over-year, while services and other revenue increased 41%, again, both on an as-reported basis. The combination of our strong product innovation and internal alignment enabled us to deliver strong 2021 financial results. We were particularly pleased with the healthy CRM suite and installed base selling in Q4 that fueled a nice closeout to the year. We saw net revenue retention rates that trended nicely above 110% for both Q4 and the full year. Customer dollar retention continued to be an important foundation for our overall strong retention performance this quarter. Net revenue retention continued to benefit from multiple upgrade drivers, with particular strength in cross-sell activity in Q4. Domestic revenue grew 42% year-over-year in Q4, while international revenue growth was 54% in constant currency and 53% as reported. International revenue as a percentage of total revenue increased 2 points year-over-year to 46% in Q4. We added 7,300 net new customers in the quarter, bringing our total customer count to 135,000, up 30% year-over-year. Average subscription revenue per customer grew 11% year-over-year to $10,875 as we saw a continued positive mix shift towards our professional and enterprise tiers, along with strong installed base selling. Deferred revenue as of the end of December was $435 million, a 37% increase year-over-year. Calculated billings was $428 million in Q4, growing 43% year-on-year in constant currency and 38% as reported. Constant currency revenue growth in Q4 exceeded constant currency billings growth, primarily as a result of the strong installed base selling mix in the quarter and modestly lower overall billing duration. The remainder of my comments will refer to non-GAAP measures. Fourth quarter gross margin was 81%, down slightly year-over-year. Subscription gross margin was 84% in Q4, while services and other gross margin was negative 15%. Full year gross margin was 81%, down 1 point year-over-year. Subscription gross margin was 84%, while services and other gross margin was negative 5%. Fourth quarter operating margin was 10%, and full year operating margin was 9%, both up slightly compared to 2020. At the end of the fourth quarter, we had nearly 5,900 employees, up 40% year-over-year. Throughout 2021, we invested in the strategic priorities that Yamini outlined and are well positioned to continue to meet the strong customer demand for our products and drive innovation to fuel growth in 2022 and beyond. Net income in the fourth quarter was $30 million or $0.58 per fully diluted share. Net income for the full year was $92 million or $1.82 per fully diluted share. CapEx, including capitalized software development costs, was $19 million or 5% of revenue in Q4 and $62 million or 5% of revenue for the full year. Free cash flow in the quarter was $78 million or 21% of revenue and $203 million or 16% of revenue for the full year. Finally, our cash and marketable securities totaled $1.4 billion at the end of December. And with that, let's dive into guidance for the first quarter and full year of 2022. For the first quarter, total as-reported revenue is expected to be in the range of $381 million to $383 million, up 36% year-over-year at the midpoint. We expect FX to be approximately a 4-point headwind to as-reported revenue growth in the first quarter. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be between $30 million and $31 million. Non-GAAP diluted net income per share is expected to be between $0.46 and $0.48. This assumes 51.3 million fully diluted shares outstanding. And for the full year of 2022, total as-reported revenue is expected to be in the range of $1.72 billion to $1.73 billion, up 33% year-over-year at the midpoint. We expect FX to be approximately a 3-point headwind to as-reported revenue growth for the full year 2022. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be between $153 million and $157 million. Non-GAAP diluted net income per share is expected to be between $2.34 and $2.42. This assumes 51.5 million fully diluted shares outstanding. As you adjust your models, keep in mind the following. Given we will have some unusual revenue growth comparisons again in 2022, I thought it would be helpful to provide some color on the cadence of growth throughout the year. We anticipate as-reported revenue growth of 34% year-over-year in the first half of 2022, followed by 32% in the second half of the year. At the beginning of 2022, we adopted the new convertible debt accounting standard. Under this new standard, our fully diluted share count assumes a full share settlement of our notes, which adds approximately 1 million shares to our Q1 fully diluted share count and 850,000 shares to our full year fully diluted share count. This change is embedded in our guidance. We expect CapEx as a percentage of revenue to be roughly 6% and free cash flow to be about $240 million for the full year of 2022, with seasonally stronger free cash flow in Q1 and Q4. And with that, I'll hand things back over to Yamini for her closing remarks.\nYamini Rangan: Thank you so much, Kate. I want to close out today by circling back on our commitments to building a diverse and inclusive workplace. Just last month, HubSpot was named the number 2 Best Place to Work on Glassdoor, and we have similarly been recognized for our inclusive culture in multiple categories on Comparably. Having a strong team is essential to growing the company and becoming the number 1 CRM platform for scaling companies. I'm so thankful to the entire HubSpot team for making this such an amazing place to work, and I'm excited about the investments we are continuing to make to ensure that all of our employees feel included and inspired. With that, operator, please open up the call for some questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And with that, we'll take our first question this afternoon from Stan Zlotsky at Morgan Stanley.\nStan Zlotsky: Congratulations on a very strong quarter and a very strong end to the year. Kate, maybe just one question for you. Could you just unpack the delta again between the Q4 reported billings and the Q4 constant currency billings for us, please?\nKate Bueker: Yes. Sure thing. Thanks for the question and thanks for the comments. So we reported constant currency billings of 43%. Our constant currency revenue growth was 47%, as you know. There are 2 things that contribute to the difference. The first is that we, again, this quarter had a very strong focus on installed base selling. And what tends to happen when we sell into our installed base is we co-term those deals with their existing contracts. So the months upfront associated with those deals are relatively shorter. And then the second thing is that there was a modest decrease overall in duration, and those 2 things together actually more than accounted for the difference between constant currency revenue and constant currency billing.\nOperator: We'll take our next question now from Samad Samana with Jefferies.\nSamad Samana: Just a great year to all the company's employees even with transitions and everything, you didn't miss a beat, Yamini, and congrats on that. So maybe if I think about the quarter and, Kate, I appreciate the growth cadence. I think one of the things I'd like to ask about is that the cross-sell upsell motion as the cohorts have settled into this kind of 7,000-plus net adds, how should we think about how much of it is cross-selling additional modules into the base versus upselling these cohorts into higher-tier SKUs? And what's driving that? Because even as those cohorts have stabilized, you've still seen really robust billings growth and revenue growth?\nKate Bueker: Yes. It's an interesting question. I think that, as we've talked about retention over the last couple of quarters, I think the good news is that it's coming -- the increase in retention is coming from a lot of different places. And we always start with the sort of foundation of customer dollar retention stepping up. But when we talk about the difference in customer dollar retention and net revenue retention, what I've said consistently is that, that upgrade motion is being driven by a variety of factors, right? And so the upgrade in addition has been a notable driver of that change. The increase in seats has been a notable driver. And then finally, and I think this was really the highlight for Q4 for me, the cross-sell activity, particularly around Operations Hub, was notable in Q4.\nOperator: We'll go next now to Mark Murphy with JPMorgan.\nMark Murphy: I'll add my congratulations. Yamini, some of your partners had mentioned a very strong pipeline, I think the largest pipeline in company history that they were seeing. And I noticed your preliminary 2022 guidance. It's actually -- I believe it's 6 points faster than the preliminary guidance that you gave last year. But there's kind of an investor narrative around pull-forward of IT spending kind of in the last couple of years. Could you just help us understand what are customers prioritizing incrementally here for 2022 in terms of maybe movement from marketing to sales or maybe going up the enterprise SKUs or custom objects or something else that's underpinning that?\nYamini Rangan: Yes. Thanks a lot, Mark, for the question, and I appreciate your feedback. And yes, we are entering this year with a very solid pipeline. And if I were to step back and think about the -- all of the combination of reasons why we have a solid pipeline getting into this year is, I think, 3 specific things. First off, stepping way back, at the beginning of the pandemic, customers were looking for digital solutions to help them get connected to their customers. That's the inbound marketing, the inside sales, the omnichannel support, and HubSpot was a very -- a perfect solution for that. I think now as we are slowly getting out of the pandemic, small/medium businesses are looking to grow, and they're looking to increase front-office productivity. And so when I talk to customers, they are continuing to lean in on technology investment. They are looking to get marketing, sales, service on the same platform so that there is keener visibility in terms of customer trends that can drive the growth. And I think the third factor is that we have a very unique value proposition at this time, and it resonates really well for the markets that we serve. Our platform is crafted, it's easy to buy, it's easy to use and is exactly what meets the needs of our customers. So I think the combination of these factors lead to solid demand environment, and that's what we're seeing in the pipeline.\nOperator: And next, we'll go to Brad Sills with Bank of America.\nBrad Sills: Congratulations from me as well on a real nice end of the year. Maybe one for you, Yamini. We see a pretty challenging hiring environment across software. You guys are guiding to 36% constant currency growth for the year. So obviously, a lot of growth there. How are you finding the hiring environment? Any commentary on that effort as you look to the year in hiring?\nYamini Rangan: Thanks a lot, Brad, and thank you for that question. Look, I think that talent overall in general and SaaS talent in particular have been in kind of demand for a little while. It's really hard to remember a time where that has not been the case. But having said that, I look at the foundational factors that HubSpot has for us to be able to hire and retain great talent. And it starts with our culture. We've talked a lot about how products and culture are equally important and how we continue to evolve both product and culture. That has continued to be the case for a very long time at HubSpot, and we've invested in that. Just like product, we use Net Promoter Score as a way to look at product quality. Same thing comes with culture. And the way we measure that is both ENPS, Employee Net Promoter Score, internally. And it is our rating on things like Glassdoor. We just got awarded number 2 Best Place to Work on Glassdoor, and that shows the strength in terms of the culture. The second part of the foundation is really providing for flexibility. We made a choice very early on during the pandemic on hybrid work, and that means we've provided a lot of flexibility, and we have made hybrid work for our team, and that flexibility rules. And so the combination of culture as well as the foundation or flexibility has really helped us hire and retain top talent even in this market. So I feel very good going into this year.\nOperator: Next we'll hear from Arjun Bhatia with William Blair.\nArjun Bhatia: Congrats on a great quarter. Yamini, I think you both mentioned Operations Hub as a major driver of the growth this quarter, especially the cross-sell activity. I'm just curious if you've seen any pent-up demand for that Enterprise edition that was -- that you released late in the year last year. And then I'd be curious to hear what you're seeing in terms of market and competitive dynamics there because there are some pure plays in the rev ops market. So is this more greenfield? Or do you see other vendors playing in these deals where you are seeing success in -- with your Ops Hub product?\nYamini Rangan: Great question, Arjun. Thank you so much for that. Well, we're very pleased with the momentum within Operations Hub. As you've heard me talk about, we now have 50,000 customers on Operations Hub, and that's growing from about 10,000 customers in October. And I was also very pleased to see that 40% of Operations Hub new bookings in Q4 came from that enterprise tier that we recently launched. So that's clearly resonating, and there is momentum and adoption of that enterprise tier. Now just a step back on Operations Hub. That's how it's slightly different from all other hubs. We think of like Marketing and Sales at the front store. Operations Hub is like the supercharger. You go to a nice restaurant, and you have a great meal. There's main course, but then there's a song that makes the whole meal just tastier. Operations Hubs like that for us. It just makes the whole CRM platform sing in terms of the value. And so it's really solid and it's resonating. We saw a lot of momentum in Q4. Now you asked about the Enterprise edition. We've launched it. And the Enterprise edition is all about reporting and driving insights so that our customers who are adopting the entire CRM suite can see a lot of those insights will continue to grow. Data sets is a very key feature there. We're definitely seeing data sets as well as the advanced reporting within the enterprise edition drive momentum. So overall, look, we're very pleased with how the launch overall went and the momentum that we're seeing within Operations Hub.\nOperator: We go next now to Michael Turits with KeyBanc.\nMichael Turits: Congrats on the quarter. Kate, on the net adds, it was 7,000, which is about where you and you want to expect them to be. Do you feel like that is stable or the trends are for? And from a -- you commented on gross dollar churn. But on a customer churn basis, are we through that churn of the 2020 starter customers? And is customers churn starting to stabilize?\nKate Bueker: Yes. Thanks for the question. So we have one more difficult quarter of comparison in the first quarter around that Starter Growth Suite. But I will say we've seen some consistency around that 7,000-plus in terms of new customer adds quarter in and quarter out. We feel good about that continuing into 2022. I think the balance there is obviously ASRPC. We've seen that trend up a bit over the course of 2021. It grew 11% in Q4. Going into 2022, we feel like -- we've been saying high single digits. We feel now comfortable that we think ASRPC can grow in that low double digits in 2022.\nOperator: And next, we'll go now to Ken Wong with Guggenheim Securities.\nKen Wong: I think this one probably for Dharmesh. Obviously, data restrictions have been impacting marketing ROI. We even heard Facebook management express a need to rebuild their ad infrastructure to improve targeting. Are you guys hearing that from your customer base? Anything that maybe is resonating across kind of that marketing world that we should be thinking about as far as data restrictions and potential tailwinds for your business?\nDharmesh Shah: Yes. A couple of things. Thanks for the question. So first on the kind of the privacy front, we've seen this movement towards increased focus on privacy for all of our 15 years now. And HubSpot's kind of grew up with this kind of inbound marketing philosophy, which is very kind of consumer-friendly and privacy-focused. So on that front, we've seen kind of neutral to positive as regulations have shifted as there's increased scrutiny around privacy. The other thing I'd kind of note is that the companies that are most impacted by these kind of shifts in regulation are the ones that are like -- have a large network with a large advertising base where you're a massive consumer mobile application with tens of millions of users. HubSpot doesn't fall into that camp, so we haven't really seen much impact on our business. And our customers are similar. They're in the kind of B2B-considered purchase side of things. So the regulation shifts haven't really impacted them measurably either. The other thing that's happening, as you noted, is this kind of focus on the EU to U.S. kind of data transfer regulations. We've been watching that closely. We haven't seen any impact on our business yet. Operationally, we did make a change last year where we launched a feature called Hubli, which allows us to take all of HubSpot and host it in different geographies. And we use that new feature to be able to offer our customers the option to host in the EU if they choose to do so. But overall, we're watching the headlines like everyone else, but no real meaningful impact from the business.\nOperator: And next, we'll be now to Gabriela Borges with Goldman Sachs.\nGabriela Borges: I want to follow up on the commentary on customer adds being stable. And as a little bit of a depth of TAM question, which is, Yamini, could you describe for us a little bit the customers that are joining the HubSpot platform today as new customers that were not compelled to upgrade or digitally transform in 2019, 2020, 2021, how would you describe those customers? And how do you get comfortable with the depth of the TAM that you're targeting as potential customer adds and the runway ahead of you?\nYamini Rangan: Thank you so much, Gabriela, for the question. It's -- what we see is customers on different parts of the journey. We certainly saw in 2020, 2021, a whole wave of customers that were thinking about digital first and thinking about being digital-ready, and they all needed to be able to connect with their customers, and we saw that wave. I think what we're seeing now is just this continued digitization of the front office. And specifically, customers still have very disparate systems. Their front-office tools and the tech stack is really fragmented. And it's like trying to stitch all of these pieces together to get the kind of visibility that they need. We're seeing customers that continue to have growth as a priority, and they don't have the visibility across the whole marketing, sales, service. And if you look at these customers, they look at the tech stack, they look at how they need to drive front-office productivity and they're like, okay, we need something that is just this beautiful, seamless customer experience that we can deliver to be able to drive growth. And so that's maybe a slight shift. But in both cases, I think we have invested from a product innovation perspective over the last 12 to 18 months. And our value proposition of quick time to value, easy to adopt and easy to drive the consolidation of the tax act, that just works. And that's what we're seeing overall.\nOperator: Next, we go now to Ryan MacDonald with Needham & Company.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Josh on for Ryan. Congrats on the strong quarter and year. I wanted to get some color on what payments use cases seem to be resonating more materially with customers? Would it be like the touchless B2B sales motion or the optimization around the quote-to-cash process? Or what -- maybe get some more details there.\nYamini Rangan: Josh, yes, thanks a lot for the question. First off, we were very excited about payments going GA, but it's very, very early days. And if we step back, we want to help our B2B customers deliver great consumer-grade buying experience, whether they want to sell online or they want to sell via rep. That's what we are focused on. And a bit early stage of a new product introduction and looking for a couple of things. I'm looking for product market fit and the validation of our early hypothesis. And that's exactly what we are hearing from early customer feedback. So we went in with a couple of big hypotheses. One is that embedding payments into CRM will spur B2B e-commerce, and it will [Indiscernible]. And we're seeing that. We're seeing that in the use cases. A number of examples of this news gave, but we have a management consulting customer that's connecting family offices to businesses. They had the entire outsourced finance team that was creating invoices, sending invoices, tracking those, tracking check. All of these are like manual. With HubSpot Payments, they are just selling online. And they are just seamlessly getting their customers without any touch into their service. And so that's the example of the use case. And so that selling online use case is definitely resonating. The second big hypothesis we have is commerce context in CRM is going to add a ton of value for our customers. And that's also resonating, and that's a set of use cases that we're seeing. And so early feedback has been really good. We'll continue to be very focused on the target market pitch as well as making sure that the customer experience, all the way from discovery of payment to starting an application, completing an application, finishing the transaction, that entire process is just beautiful and consumer like. So that's what we're going to be focused on. We're happy with the feedback that we're getting early on.\nOperator: We go next now to Rishi Jaluria with RBC Capital Markets.\nRishi Jaluria: Nice to see continued strength in the business. I just wanted to double-click on the operating margin guidance. You're guiding to effectively flat operating margins in 2022, which is great to see. But maybe just wanted to kind of get a sense for how you're thinking about where your investment priorities are. And maybe alongside that, as we in the back half of the year, hopefully, start to reopen up offices, start to get back to in-person conferences, maybe even get salespeople back on the road and in person doing meetings, how do you think about the return of some of those costs as you put out that guidance?\nKate Bueker: Yes. Sure. Why don't I take that one. I think you've heard from Yamini throughout this call that we feel really good about the long-term opportunity that's sitting in front of us. We're focused on making sure that we are investing to drive that long-term durable growth, right? And there are a few areas in 2022 that we're focused on making those investments. They're going to line up pretty closely with the strategic priorities that Yamini talked about in her prepared remarks. So the first one would be product and engineering. We're going to continue to invest in our R&D organization to drive innovation. We think it's important to both plant the seeds and continued innovation across our portfolio. We feel really good about the return we're getting there. We saw a lot of new products and features in 2021. On the go-to-market side, we are definitely leaning into our segmentation, and that is investing in automation at the low end. It's investing in that sort of value and all of this around some components were upmarket. And then finally, we're investing really across the business in systems and process to make sure we're laying the foundation to scale over time. I guess to answer your specific question around what happens as we sort of open back up, we are assuming that along with regulation -- local regulation that we will start to become a more sort of mobile, in office or at least highly flexible workforce. We are less T&E-dependent than many other enterprise-oriented companies. And so there is a bit of a headwind to our margin in 2022 as a result of that. But it's not the same that you would see at many other places.\nOperator: Next, we go to Parker Lane with Stifel.\nParker Lane: In the last few years, we've released a lot of new tools, whether it be content management, operations-focused, service-focused use cases. How has the type of partner that you're attracting to the ecosystem change with the release of these tools? And what's the company's strategy around acquiring new partners, getting them ramped up and making sure they're going to be successful given that these are a little bit different use cases than the marketing- and sales-focused partners you worked with in the past?\nYamini Rangan: Thanks a lot. I love a good partner question. A lot of partner ecosystem -- I'll tell you like the partner ecosystem is that -- really come along with us. And almost 18 months ago, we went to the partners and we said, \"We have a clear strategy for the partner ecosystem, which is we want to scale selling and servicing with partners.\" Why? Because the partners get involved, our customers get onboarded the right way. They get a lot more value, and therefore, they stay longer with us. It's good for our customers, and therefore, it's good for HubSpot. And so what we've done -- and if you step back, we had a lot of these marketing agencies that were working on a retainer basis. And over the last couple of years, we have invested in training, enablement, joint selling so that they not only do that but are able to meet the entire breadth of the product portfolio and the service needs there. And so now we have partners that do more complex CRM implementations, much more integrations, deal with complex use cases as we go upmarket. And there's just a nice development and momentum of partners who can provide the full set of services. In 2022, we are investing in that co-selling. We have a common interface so that we know exactly the conversations we are jointly having with customers. And we're continuing to invest in terms of partner enablement, but also getting our direct sales teams talking with the partners a lot more. I'm really happy with where the partner ecosystem is kind of going based on a lot of the investments we have made.\nOperator: Next, we go to Siti Panigrahi with Mizuho.\nMatt Diamond: This is Matt on for Siti. Yamini, I'm very curious about your payments business, the assumptions around that embedded into 2022 guidance. You've spoken very eloquently about digital transformation this year. It sounds like there's a lot of emphasis for customers to upgrade. I'd love to hear your thinking around how Payments could generate your -- could be a driver for your guidance in 2022.\nKate Bueker: Thanks for the question. It's Kate. I think I'll jump in on that one. I think we are very excited about the long-term future for payments. But I do want to make sure that you heard Yamini that we are early. It was -- the payments offering was a beta for Q4. It's gone GA, which is an incredible milestone in Q1. That said, we do not -- we did not embed any material revenue or COGS associated with Payments in our '22 guidance. So it's neither -- we didn't see meaningful results, and we don't expect it to be a meaningful revenue driver in 2022.\nOperator: And next, we'll go to Brent Bracelin with Piper Sandler.\nBrent Bracelin: I wanted to go back to average subscription revenue per customer. We haven't seen double-digit growth here for 5, 6 years and now you're suggesting that, that could be sustainable into next year. So a question here, why now? Is this just the multi-product strategy is maturing and it's now resonating? Just trying to understand the change there because it does sound like it's material. You're increasingly confident that in the cross-sell. Just would love a little more color on kind of the why now and what gives you confidence it's sustainable.\nKate Bueker: Yes. Thank you. Maybe I'll start and then if I miss anything, Yamini can add some perspective. I think that -- you have heard from us that we have been driving innovation at that upmarket tier. We've also been driving innovation at the low end, where that is a more product and automated set of innovation. Both of those things help drive the overall growth of HubSpot. They are going to ebb and flow from 1 quarter to the next quarter, and they will have a bunch of -- there will be some balance. You saw a real strength in that starter tier throughout 2020. What you've seen over 2021 and what we're expecting to continue into 2022 is a lot of the benefit of some of the innovation that we've been doing at that upmarket, right? And so it's a combination of the mix of customers over the last quarters being at that pro and enterprise level, along with the installed base selling motion that we're getting success with in cross-sell and seat expansion, et cetera.\nOperator: And next, we go to Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo.\nMichael Turrin: Obviously, great job with the 2021 results. One to start there, but was hoping to spend some time on just segmentation of the move upmarket. We've heard some encouraging signs from your partners echoing what Yamini is saying just around better alignment, but also larger customers than that historical sweet spot showing up asking for hubs and more formal processes. And I just want to explore what's happening behind the scenes there? How much of this, from your perspective, is tied to internal efforts, some of the partner efforts that you've embarked on? And obviously, having a more comprehensive products that helps, too. But just would love to just explore that in more context given there's just a lot of good things happening with the growth drivers here currently.\nYamini Rangan: Yes. Thanks a lot for the question, Michael. And you exactly made it right. So we definitely see from a product perspective, from a go-to-market perspective as well as partner alignment. And if you step back for the past year, we've been talking about our focus in terms of really all of our segments. And especially the 200 to 2,000 segment, which we call the upmarket segment, we're really focusing both from a product as well as the go-to-market perspective. On the product side, you saw a lot of the investments that we did last year. The best that we are making are paying off. On the Sales Hub side, a ton of innovation, all the way from Conversation Intelligence to more advanced forecasting, to CPQ, all of those add tremendous amount of power at that enterprise tier. You saw the same thing with Marketing Hub. And so almost every hub, we have really invested and the pace of acceleration -- the pace of innovation is actually showing up. On the go-to-market side, one of the things that we say internally at HubSpot is that you can have a great strategy, but just alignment across products and go-to-market is even more important than strategy. And over the last 18 months, we have again focused on that alignment. And when we say alignment with a good market, it's like when we pour innovation to the enterprise tier, then there is an aligned sales motion where our sales reps with the partner ecosystem are talking to our customers about the value that we are getting, which is very powerful, right? So I think it's that coordinated effort across products, go-to-market and partners that drive that upmarket momentum, and we're going to continue to invest on that.\nOperator: And next, we'll go to Brian Peterson at Raymond James.\nBrian Peterson: Congrats on a really strong quarter. Just one for me on the international strength. That's been above 50% growth in constant currency for three quarters in a row now. So just curious, anything that's driving that, that may be different than the domestic results? And how should we think about level of investment internationally?\nYamini Rangan: Thanks, Brian, for the question. Look, it's consistent both in terms of North America as well as international. And in fact, in Q4, they both accelerated in terms of constant currency growth. I'd say, if you step back, what is common across North America and international is just the need for just a beautiful front-office platform. That is the demand that we see, both in terms of North America as well as international segments. And we just meet the needs right now, and we talked a lot about the product innovation. We've talked a lot about the improvements that we have had both on the product side and the go-to-market side. And I think we're firing kind of on all cylinders across the pillars. In terms of international, I'd say a couple of things. First off, it is a little bit of an earlier stage in some of the countries that we operate in. Customers are a bit earlier in digital transformation. And therefore, our market penetration is low. And therefore, there's momentum there. And then the second thing I'd say is that we have continued to invest in terms of product localization, customer-facing resources. And there's really good LTV-to-CAC and return on that LTV-to-CAC that we see in international markets. And so overall, we continue to invest in both of the markets and we're -- we like the balance in terms of the performance both internationally as well as in North America.\nOperator: And next, we'll hear from Ryan Krieger with Wolfe Research.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Alan on for Alex. Kate, can you please unpack the subscription dollar retention rate in the quarter? How does that directly compare to previous Q3? And is that a number that settles here? Is there a pathway for it to grow? How should we think about that going forward?\nKate Bueker: Yes. We've talked about net revenue. We spent a bunch of time at the Analyst Day talking about what is going on with our retention, right? And we look at retention internally in 2 different ways. We look at our gross retention. We call it customer dollar retention. And that has, over the last 12 to 18 months, moved up pretty meaningfully. When you look at it relative to Q3, it's generally in the same ballpark, right? We saw a step-up, and that has stayed very healthy. And what is driving that is a couple of things. One is that our customers are just using our product more. Yamini talked about the sort of front-office answer that HubSpot provides. We are just seeing our customers use more and different parts of the product. The other thing that we are -- is benefiting our customers all our attention is that we're signing longer contracts with our customers. And that sort of just helps with the overall retention. In terms of -- then there's an upgrade between our gross retention and our net retention. That also has improved over the last 12 to 18 months. And what we've said is as a target in mind is 1 10-plus for net revenue retention. And the upgrade drivers are pretty diverse. I've talked a little bit about them already on this call. It's edition upgrades, it's expansions of seats, it's cross-selling and adopting multiple hubs. And we think that 1 10-plus is the right target for you to be thinking about for the foreseeable future.\nOperator: And next, we go to Adam Holt with BMO.\nKeith Bachman: It's Keith Bachman from BMO. If you can hear me, I'm just going to launch my question. The question is this\nYamini Rangan: Keith?\nKeith Bachman: Yes, sorry. You confused me with Adam at BMO. Kate, for you, you've talked about the customer adds being consistent, but just wondering if the context of that is a different mix. What I mean by that is within the customer adds that you're getting on a quarterly basis, is it a richer mix of customers? Or is it the same mix of customers? Because the data -- as you're attracting larger enterprise, it seemed to me that it's a richer mix of customers, but just like to hear a clarification of that as we're thinking about the customer adds during 2022. Along with that, if you could just comment on how we should be thinking about Operations Hub attach rates and growth rates in 2022. Again, with the backdrop, it seems to us that you're getting a larger share of larger customers. And so I just would like to hear your context of how Operations Hub may do within the color of 2022 guidance.\nKate Bueker: Yes. Why don't I start with the customer add question. And Yamini, I might hand it to you for the Operations Hub context. It's an interesting question. I think I would answer it by kind of turning back the clock to the beginning of the pandemic. And 2020 was a year where we launched our Starter Growth Suite at $50, and that was a big change for us. And what we saw was just a step function increase in the adds at that starter tier. Having now lapped that for a couple of quarters, what we're seeing is a bit more of a balance, right, in terms of the composition of the new customer adds across the starter tier and with the professional and enterprise. And that mix is actually one of the drivers of the increase in ASRPC that we're seeing. And so I do expect that composition in 2022 will look more like 2021 than it will the start of the pandemic, and that really concentrated starter adds that we saw in 2020.\nYamini Rangan: I would think that -- Operations Hub, I think it's -- I talked a little bit about the Operations Hub and the value of Operations Hub that's really supercharging the other hubs. I think the broader point in terms of the mix that we see is just more multi-hub. We talked about it in the prepared remarks that -- 60% of our customer base being multi-hub. Now having introduced products like Operations Hub and CMS and also adding more value to our anchor hubs like Marketing and Sales, we just see a lot more of 2 hubs or 3 hub pairs, and that goes to show the overall value that our customers are getting from HubSpot. And so that's how I would think about it for last year as well as going into 2022.\nOperator: And next, we'll go to Terry Tillman at Truist Securities.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Connor on for Terry. So you touched a little bit on this before, but just on a bigger-picture view, as your product portfolio ramps up and more products start to come online, how your conversations to customer shifting in terms of seeing the value of adopting multiple hubs? And what are some ways you've really seen customers leaning into the connectedness of the platform and the vision that you set forward?\nYamini Rangan: Yes. That's a great question. We've been talking about the overall pace of innovation and also the value that customers get. I would say like if I step back -- and I've been talking to a lot of customers in Q4 as well as January. There are a couple of really big challenges for small/medium businesses right now. There's just a huge challenge of trying to switch disparate systems that just don't work well. Small/medium businesses don't have the time. They don't have the budget. They don't have the technical teams that are sitting around unlike maybe some of the larger companies, and that's a huge challenge. The second part of the challenge is that they want to get payer visibility across the entire customer journey, but marketing and sales are still in silos, and they don't get that type of visibility to drive the growth that they need. And so HubSpot solves both of these challenges, and we become an easy and clear platform choice. And that's why our customers are adopting more hubs on average and getting more value per hub. And when I talk to customers, they're like, look, we don't even know when one of your hubs stops and the other one starts. It's seamless and it's just a beautiful customer experience. Plus we have added a lot to our overall ecosystem, which is the 1,000 integrations that we talked about. And it makes us an easier platform choice for small/medium businesses. And look, this is exactly what we want. We want to be the number 1 CRM platform for scaling businesses, and I think it really meets the need all customers within the segment. So we feel very good about it.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude our question-and-answer session for today. Ms. Rangan, I'd like to turn the conference back to you for any closing or additional comments.\nYamini Rangan: Thank you, everyone. Great talking to you, and look forward to connecting back in the quarter. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude today's HubSpot Q4 2021 earnings conference call. I'd like to thank you all for joining us and wish you all a great evening. Goodbye",

            "name": "Kate Bueker",
            "content": "Thanks, Yamini. Let's turn to our fourth quarter and full year 2021 financial results. Fourth quarter revenue grew 47% year-over-year both in constant currency and on an as-reported basis. Q4 subscription revenue grew 47% year-over-year, while services and other revenue increased 38%, both on an as-reported basis. Full year 2021 revenue grew 45% year-over-year in constant currency and 47% as reported. Full year subscription revenue grew 48% year-over-year, while services and other revenue increased 41%, again, both on an as-reported basis. The combination of our strong product innovation and internal alignment enabled us to deliver strong 2021 financial results. We were particularly pleased with the healthy CRM suite and installed base selling in Q4 that fueled a nice closeout to the year. We saw net revenue retention rates that trended nicely above 110% for both Q4 and the full year. Customer dollar retention continued to be an important foundation for our overall strong retention performance this quarter. Net revenue retention continued to benefit from multiple upgrade drivers, with particular strength in cross-sell activity in Q4. Domestic revenue grew 42% year-over-year in Q4, while international revenue growth was 54% in constant currency and 53% as reported. International revenue as a percentage of total revenue increased 2 points year-over-year to 46% in Q4. We added 7,300 net new customers in the quarter, bringing our total customer count to 135,000, up 30% year-over-year. Average subscription revenue per customer grew 11% year-over-year to $10,875 as we saw a continued positive mix shift towards our professional and enterprise tiers, along with strong installed base selling. Deferred revenue as of the end of December was $435 million, a 37% increase year-over-year. Calculated billings was $428 million in Q4, growing 43% year-on-year in constant currency and 38% as reported. Constant currency revenue growth in Q4 exceeded constant currency billings growth, primarily as a result of the strong installed base selling mix in the quarter and modestly lower overall billing duration. The remainder of my comments will refer to non-GAAP measures. Fourth quarter gross margin was 81%, down slightly year-over-year. Subscription gross margin was 84% in Q4, while services and other gross margin was negative 15%. Full year gross margin was 81%, down 1 point year-over-year. Subscription gross margin was 84%, while services and other gross margin was negative 5%. Fourth quarter operating margin was 10%, and full year operating margin was 9%, both up slightly compared to 2020. At the end of the fourth quarter, we had nearly 5,900 employees, up 40% year-over-year. Throughout 2021, we invested in the strategic priorities that Yamini outlined and are well positioned to continue to meet the strong customer demand for our products and drive innovation to fuel growth in 2022 and beyond. Net income in the fourth quarter was $30 million or $0.58 per fully diluted share. Net income for the full year was $92 million or $1.82 per fully diluted share. CapEx, including capitalized software development costs, was $19 million or 5% of revenue in Q4 and $62 million or 5% of revenue for the full year. Free cash flow in the quarter was $78 million or 21% of revenue and $203 million or 16% of revenue for the full year. Finally, our cash and marketable securities totaled $1.4 billion at the end of December. And with that, let's dive into guidance for the first quarter and full year of 2022. For the first quarter, total as-reported revenue is expected to be in the range of $381 million to $383 million, up 36% year-over-year at the midpoint. We expect FX to be approximately a 4-point headwind to as-reported revenue growth in the first quarter. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be between $30 million and $31 million. Non-GAAP diluted net income per share is expected to be between $0.46 and $0.48. This assumes 51.3 million fully diluted shares outstanding. And for the full year of 2022, total as-reported revenue is expected to be in the range of $1.72 billion to $1.73 billion, up 33% year-over-year at the midpoint. We expect FX to be approximately a 3-point headwind to as-reported revenue growth for the full year 2022. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be between $153 million and $157 million. Non-GAAP diluted net income per share is expected to be between $2.34 and $2.42. This assumes 51.5 million fully diluted shares outstanding. As you adjust your models, keep in mind the following. Given we will have some unusual revenue growth comparisons again in 2022, I thought it would be helpful to provide some color on the cadence of growth throughout the year. We anticipate as-reported revenue growth of 34% year-over-year in the first half of 2022, followed by 32% in the second half of the year. At the beginning of 2022, we adopted the new convertible debt accounting standard. Under this new standard, our fully diluted share count assumes a full share settlement of our notes, which adds approximately 1 million shares to our Q1 fully diluted share count and 850,000 shares to our full year fully diluted share count. This change is embedded in our guidance. We expect CapEx as a percentage of revenue to be roughly 6% and free cash flow to be about $240 million for the full year of 2022, with seasonally stronger free cash flow in Q1 and Q4. And with that, I'll hand things back over to Yamini for her closing remarks. Yes. Sure thing. Thanks for the question and thanks for the comments. So we reported constant currency billings of 43%. Our constant currency revenue growth was 47%, as you know. There are 2 things that contribute to the difference. The first is that we, again, this quarter had a very strong focus on installed base selling. And what tends to happen when we sell into our installed base is we co-term those deals with their existing contracts. So the months upfront associated with those deals are relatively shorter. And then the second thing is that there was a modest decrease overall in duration, and those 2 things together actually more than accounted for the difference between constant currency revenue and constant currency billing. Yes. It's an interesting question. I think that, as we've talked about retention over the last couple of quarters, I think the good news is that it's coming -- the increase in retention is coming from a lot of different places. And we always start with the sort of foundation of customer dollar retention stepping up. But when we talk about the difference in customer dollar retention and net revenue retention, what I've said consistently is that, that upgrade motion is being driven by a variety of factors, right? And so the upgrade in addition has been a notable driver of that change. The increase in seats has been a notable driver. And then finally, and I think this was really the highlight for Q4 for me, the cross-sell activity, particularly around Operations Hub, was notable in Q4. Yes. Thanks for the question. So we have one more difficult quarter of comparison in the first quarter around that Starter Growth Suite. But I will say we've seen some consistency around that 7,000-plus in terms of new customer adds quarter in and quarter out. We feel good about that continuing into 2022. I think the balance there is obviously ASRPC. We've seen that trend up a bit over the course of 2021. It grew 11% in Q4. Going into 2022, we feel like -- we've been saying high single digits. We feel now comfortable that we think ASRPC can grow in that low double digits in 2022. Yes. Sure. Why don't I take that one. I think you've heard from Yamini throughout this call that we feel really good about the long-term opportunity that's sitting in front of us. We're focused on making sure that we are investing to drive that long-term durable growth, right? And there are a few areas in 2022 that we're focused on making those investments. They're going to line up pretty closely with the strategic priorities that Yamini talked about in her prepared remarks. So the first one would be product and engineering. We're going to continue to invest in our R&D organization to drive innovation. We think it's important to both plant the seeds and continued innovation across our portfolio. We feel really good about the return we're getting there. We saw a lot of new products and features in 2021. On the go-to-market side, we are definitely leaning into our segmentation, and that is investing in automation at the low end. It's investing in that sort of value and all of this around some components were upmarket. And then finally, we're investing really across the business in systems and process to make sure we're laying the foundation to scale over time. I guess to answer your specific question around what happens as we sort of open back up, we are assuming that along with regulation -- local regulation that we will start to become a more sort of mobile, in office or at least highly flexible workforce. We are less T&E-dependent than many other enterprise-oriented companies. And so there is a bit of a headwind to our margin in 2022 as a result of that. But it's not the same that you would see at many other places. Thanks for the question. It's Kate. I think I'll jump in on that one. I think we are very excited about the long-term future for payments. But I do want to make sure that you heard Yamini that we are early. It was -- the payments offering was a beta for Q4. It's gone GA, which is an incredible milestone in Q1. That said, we do not -- we did not embed any material revenue or COGS associated with Payments in our '22 guidance. So it's neither -- we didn't see meaningful results, and we don't expect it to be a meaningful revenue driver in 2022. Yes. Thank you. Maybe I'll start and then if I miss anything, Yamini can add some perspective. I think that -- you have heard from us that we have been driving innovation at that upmarket tier. We've also been driving innovation at the low end, where that is a more product and automated set of innovation. Both of those things help drive the overall growth of HubSpot. They are going to ebb and flow from 1 quarter to the next quarter, and they will have a bunch of -- there will be some balance. You saw a real strength in that starter tier throughout 2020. What you've seen over 2021 and what we're expecting to continue into 2022 is a lot of the benefit of some of the innovation that we've been doing at that upmarket, right? And so it's a combination of the mix of customers over the last quarters being at that pro and enterprise level, along with the installed base selling motion that we're getting success with in cross-sell and seat expansion, et cetera. Yes. We've talked about net revenue. We spent a bunch of time at the Analyst Day talking about what is going on with our retention, right? And we look at retention internally in 2 different ways. We look at our gross retention. We call it customer dollar retention. And that has, over the last 12 to 18 months, moved up pretty meaningfully. When you look at it relative to Q3, it's generally in the same ballpark, right? We saw a step-up, and that has stayed very healthy. And what is driving that is a couple of things. One is that our customers are just using our product more. Yamini talked about the sort of front-office answer that HubSpot provides. We are just seeing our customers use more and different parts of the product. The other thing that we are -- is benefiting our customers all our attention is that we're signing longer contracts with our customers. And that sort of just helps with the overall retention. In terms of -- then there's an upgrade between our gross retention and our net retention. That also has improved over the last 12 to 18 months. And what we've said is as a target in mind is 1 10-plus for net revenue retention. And the upgrade drivers are pretty diverse. I've talked a little bit about them already on this call. It's edition upgrades, it's expansions of seats, it's cross-selling and adopting multiple hubs. And we think that 1 10-plus is the right target for you to be thinking about for the foreseeable future. Yes. Why don't I start with the customer add question. And Yamini, I might hand it to you for the Operations Hub context. It's an interesting question. I think I would answer it by kind of turning back the clock to the beginning of the pandemic. And 2020 was a year where we launched our Starter Growth Suite at $50, and that was a big change for us. And what we saw was just a step function increase in the adds at that starter tier. Having now lapped that for a couple of quarters, what we're seeing is a bit more of a balance, right, in terms of the composition of the new customer adds across the starter tier and with the professional and enterprise. And that mix is actually one of the drivers of the increase in ASRPC that we're seeing. And so I do expect that composition in 2022 will look more like 2021 than it will the start of the pandemic, and that really concentrated starter adds that we saw in 2020."

            "name": "Yamini Rangan",
            "content": "Thank you so much, Chuck, and welcome, everyone. Thank you for joining us as we review HubSpot's fourth quarter and full year 2021 results. Last year was one of immense change, and I'm incredibly proud of how the HubSpot team was able to adapt and execute to meet the needs of our customers. Going into 2021, our goal was to be the number 1 CRM platform for scaling companies. We made significant progress towards that goal, and you can see that in our results. We have continued to see broad-based strength across the business with revenue growing 47% year-over-year in constant currency in the fourth quarter. We closed out 2021 with more than 135,000 customers globally, nearly $1.5 billion in ARR, and we generated more than $200 million of free cash flow. We also recently hit the exciting milestone of having more than 1,000 apps available in our marketplace. We know the customers who use integrations are more successful, and so having a robust ecosystem is essential to delivering on our platform vision. Now I want to take a step back and look at the macro trends that drove our sustained growth in 2021. Since HubSpot's inception, we have evangelized the shift towards digital transformation. That shift accelerated as small and medium businesses around the world have had to quickly pivot to doing business online. In this world of rapid digital transformation, providing a remarkable customer experience has gone from being a competitive advantage to being a necessity. Now more than ever, businesses need a modern and powerful CRM that helps them create those experiences. And HubSpot is becoming a CRM provider of choice for these SMBs as they navigate this journey. We did 2 things exceptionally well in 2021: we drove product innovation, and we aligned our product and go-to-market functions for tight execution. First, let's talk about product innovation. We both innovated on our anchor hubs and expanded our CRM platform with new product offerings. Operations Hub, which we launched in April, is one of those new products. This new hub meets the needs of operations teams struggling to get clean data, automate that data, report on that data and drive insights to help their businesses grow. Through Operations Hub, revenue operations teams have access to more than 100 native integrations that bring even more data into HubSpot to make it very powerful. Operations Hub supercharges the HubSpot CRM and drives more value, and we are seeing that in the numbers. We surpassed more than 15,000 customers using Operations Hub in Q4 and are seeing strong demand among both existing customers and new customers adopting it as part of our CRM suite. We also introduced a new lever for growth with payments and commerce and believe that commerce-enabled CRM can drive growth for our customers. I'm really thrilled to share that HubSpot Payments is now available to all U.S. customers, with our target segment being companies with fewer than 100 employees. Customer feedback is validating our hypothesis that a commerce solution is much more powerful when it's natively built inside of a CRM. We know that native payments are widely important for SMBs to grow their businesses online, particularly when it comes to having commerce context embedded in CRM. This actually ensures that all front-office teams have visibility into their interactions with the customer. While it's very early days, we're encouraged by the momentum we're seeing with our payments offering. In addition to launching new products, we have continued to invest in our anchor hubs of Marketing, Sales and Service. We extended our lead in CRM and drove sustained growth with new enterprise-level features platform-wide. Getting insights across the entire front office is still a huge challenge for many scaling companies. They're forced to use siloed, disparate systems that don't give them the visibility they need to grow their business. The improvements we made in 2021 are helping to solve those challenges, particularly when customers adopt multiple hubs. Multi-hub adoption now accounts for 60% of our customer base compared to 34% in 2017, which is a powerful indicator that our customers are seeing value in adopting HubSpot across multiple parts of their business. Take a look at ResellerRatings, a user-generated content platform for retail brands. Like many scaling companies, they were bogged down with a disparate stack of multiple front-office tools that did not provide visibility across the business. So their marketing and sales teams consolidated all of their work on HubSpot and saw a 25% increase in traffic, 30% increase in contract value and a 75% decrease in customer churn rate. This is exactly what we expect to see when customers adopt our CRM suite. ResellerRatings is creating better experience for their customers and scaling with HubSpot. Now let's shift gears to talk about the alignment between product and go-to-market and how that drove great execution in 2021. Our sweet spot historically has been the 20- to 200-employee segment. Last year, we set out to optimize the customer experience across all 3 key segments in which we operate. At the lower end, we're providing a full suite that is easy to use and easy to buy, and we are driving better experience through touchless and chat-assisted sales. We're making it seamless for customers to adopt our product, and we see that within our suite momentum. At the higher end of the market, we've continued to invest significantly in internal enablement initiatives that are driving higher sales productivity. We're also working to strengthen the alignment between inside sales and our solutions partners, and we're seeing momentum there. The process rigor that we have is enabling our sales team to better communicate the value of HubSpot and win higher-value, higher-ASP, upmarket deals that contributed to the strong results we saw across the year. As I look back on our accomplishments in 2021, we made remarkable progress on our path to becoming the CRM platform of choice for scaling companies. Small and medium businesses need great front-office solutions that can provide insights to drive growth. That increase mean, coupled with our product innovation and go-to-market execution, gives us a solid foundation for strong growth in 2022. Looking to this year, we're going to stay focused on the 4 strategic priorities that I outlined at the Analyst Day. Our first priority is to deliver a world-class, front-office platform by continuing to invest in new and existing hubs as well as driving extensibility of that platform. Our second strategic priority is to strengthen our segmentation approach across product and go-to-market. We will continue to deliver consumer-grade experiences with powerful enterprise-grade features. That will translate into a focus on driving broad suite adoption at the starter tier while enabling customers to gain more value from professional and enterprise tiers. Our third strategic priority is to invest in payments and commerce. We will be laser-focused on driving full adoption through the entire customer journey from payment discovery to transaction. We will also look to increase the volume that merchants transact in the product. Finally, our priority is to build a sustainable company. We'll do that by hiring and developing diverse talent adopting and reporting on environmentally sustainable practices and investing in data privacy solutions that build customer trust. I am really excited about the opportunity ahead and the investments we're making in 2022 to execute towards that opportunity. With that, I'll hand it over to Kate to discuss our financial results. Kate? Thank you so much, Kate. I want to close out today by circling back on our commitments to building a diverse and inclusive workplace. Just last month, HubSpot was named the number 2 Best Place to Work on Glassdoor, and we have similarly been recognized for our inclusive culture in multiple categories on Comparably. Having a strong team is essential to growing the company and becoming the number 1 CRM platform for scaling companies. I'm so thankful to the entire HubSpot team for making this such an amazing place to work, and I'm excited about the investments we are continuing to make to ensure that all of our employees feel included and inspired. With that, operator, please open up the call for some questions. Yes. Thanks a lot, Mark, for the question, and I appreciate your feedback. And yes, we are entering this year with a very solid pipeline. And if I were to step back and think about the -- all of the combination of reasons why we have a solid pipeline getting into this year is, I think, 3 specific things. First off, stepping way back, at the beginning of the pandemic, customers were looking for digital solutions to help them get connected to their customers. That's the inbound marketing, the inside sales, the omnichannel support, and HubSpot was a very -- a perfect solution for that. I think now as we are slowly getting out of the pandemic, small/medium businesses are looking to grow, and they're looking to increase front-office productivity. And so when I talk to customers, they are continuing to lean in on technology investment. They are looking to get marketing, sales, service on the same platform so that there is keener visibility in terms of customer trends that can drive the growth. And I think the third factor is that we have a very unique value proposition at this time, and it resonates really well for the markets that we serve. Our platform is crafted, it's easy to buy, it's easy to use and is exactly what meets the needs of our customers. So I think the combination of these factors lead to solid demand environment, and that's what we're seeing in the pipeline. Thanks a lot, Brad, and thank you for that question. Look, I think that talent overall in general and SaaS talent in particular have been in kind of demand for a little while. It's really hard to remember a time where that has not been the case. But having said that, I look at the foundational factors that HubSpot has for us to be able to hire and retain great talent. And it starts with our culture. We've talked a lot about how products and culture are equally important and how we continue to evolve both product and culture. That has continued to be the case for a very long time at HubSpot, and we've invested in that. Just like product, we use Net Promoter Score as a way to look at product quality. Same thing comes with culture. And the way we measure that is both ENPS, Employee Net Promoter Score, internally. And it is our rating on things like Glassdoor. We just got awarded number 2 Best Place to Work on Glassdoor, and that shows the strength in terms of the culture. The second part of the foundation is really providing for flexibility. We made a choice very early on during the pandemic on hybrid work, and that means we've provided a lot of flexibility, and we have made hybrid work for our team, and that flexibility rules. And so the combination of culture as well as the foundation or flexibility has really helped us hire and retain top talent even in this market. So I feel very good going into this year. Great question, Arjun. Thank you so much for that. Well, we're very pleased with the momentum within Operations Hub. As you've heard me talk about, we now have 50,000 customers on Operations Hub, and that's growing from about 10,000 customers in October. And I was also very pleased to see that 40% of Operations Hub new bookings in Q4 came from that enterprise tier that we recently launched. So that's clearly resonating, and there is momentum and adoption of that enterprise tier. Now just a step back on Operations Hub. That's how it's slightly different from all other hubs. We think of like Marketing and Sales at the front store. Operations Hub is like the supercharger. You go to a nice restaurant, and you have a great meal. There's main course, but then there's a song that makes the whole meal just tastier. Operations Hubs like that for us. It just makes the whole CRM platform sing in terms of the value. And so it's really solid and it's resonating. We saw a lot of momentum in Q4. Now you asked about the Enterprise edition. We've launched it. And the Enterprise edition is all about reporting and driving insights so that our customers who are adopting the entire CRM suite can see a lot of those insights will continue to grow. Data sets is a very key feature there. We're definitely seeing data sets as well as the advanced reporting within the enterprise edition drive momentum. So overall, look, we're very pleased with how the launch overall went and the momentum that we're seeing within Operations Hub. Thank you so much, Gabriela, for the question. It's -- what we see is customers on different parts of the journey. We certainly saw in 2020, 2021, a whole wave of customers that were thinking about digital first and thinking about being digital-ready, and they all needed to be able to connect with their customers, and we saw that wave. I think what we're seeing now is just this continued digitization of the front office. And specifically, customers still have very disparate systems. Their front-office tools and the tech stack is really fragmented. And it's like trying to stitch all of these pieces together to get the kind of visibility that they need. We're seeing customers that continue to have growth as a priority, and they don't have the visibility across the whole marketing, sales, service. And if you look at these customers, they look at the tech stack, they look at how they need to drive front-office productivity and they're like, okay, we need something that is just this beautiful, seamless customer experience that we can deliver to be able to drive growth. And so that's maybe a slight shift. But in both cases, I think we have invested from a product innovation perspective over the last 12 to 18 months. And our value proposition of quick time to value, easy to adopt and easy to drive the consolidation of the tax act, that just works. And that's what we're seeing overall. Josh, yes, thanks a lot for the question. First off, we were very excited about payments going GA, but it's very, very early days. And if we step back, we want to help our B2B customers deliver great consumer-grade buying experience, whether they want to sell online or they want to sell via rep. That's what we are focused on. And a bit early stage of a new product introduction and looking for a couple of things. I'm looking for product market fit and the validation of our early hypothesis. And that's exactly what we are hearing from early customer feedback. So we went in with a couple of big hypotheses. One is that embedding payments into CRM will spur B2B e-commerce, and it will [Indiscernible]. And we're seeing that. We're seeing that in the use cases. A number of examples of this news gave, but we have a management consulting customer that's connecting family offices to businesses. They had the entire outsourced finance team that was creating invoices, sending invoices, tracking those, tracking check. All of these are like manual. With HubSpot Payments, they are just selling online. And they are just seamlessly getting their customers without any touch into their service. And so that's the example of the use case. And so that selling online use case is definitely resonating. The second big hypothesis we have is commerce context in CRM is going to add a ton of value for our customers. And that's also resonating, and that's a set of use cases that we're seeing. And so early feedback has been really good. We'll continue to be very focused on the target market pitch as well as making sure that the customer experience, all the way from discovery of payment to starting an application, completing an application, finishing the transaction, that entire process is just beautiful and consumer like. So that's what we're going to be focused on. We're happy with the feedback that we're getting early on. Thanks a lot. I love a good partner question. A lot of partner ecosystem -- I'll tell you like the partner ecosystem is that -- really come along with us. And almost 18 months ago, we went to the partners and we said, \"We have a clear strategy for the partner ecosystem, which is we want to scale selling and servicing with partners.\" Why? Because the partners get involved, our customers get onboarded the right way. They get a lot more value, and therefore, they stay longer with us. It's good for our customers, and therefore, it's good for HubSpot. And so what we've done -- and if you step back, we had a lot of these marketing agencies that were working on a retainer basis. And over the last couple of years, we have invested in training, enablement, joint selling so that they not only do that but are able to meet the entire breadth of the product portfolio and the service needs there. And so now we have partners that do more complex CRM implementations, much more integrations, deal with complex use cases as we go upmarket. And there's just a nice development and momentum of partners who can provide the full set of services. In 2022, we are investing in that co-selling. We have a common interface so that we know exactly the conversations we are jointly having with customers. And we're continuing to invest in terms of partner enablement, but also getting our direct sales teams talking with the partners a lot more. I'm really happy with where the partner ecosystem is kind of going based on a lot of the investments we have made. Yes. Thanks a lot for the question, Michael. And you exactly made it right. So we definitely see from a product perspective, from a go-to-market perspective as well as partner alignment. And if you step back for the past year, we've been talking about our focus in terms of really all of our segments. And especially the 200 to 2,000 segment, which we call the upmarket segment, we're really focusing both from a product as well as the go-to-market perspective. On the product side, you saw a lot of the investments that we did last year. The best that we are making are paying off. On the Sales Hub side, a ton of innovation, all the way from Conversation Intelligence to more advanced forecasting, to CPQ, all of those add tremendous amount of power at that enterprise tier. You saw the same thing with Marketing Hub. And so almost every hub, we have really invested and the pace of acceleration -- the pace of innovation is actually showing up. On the go-to-market side, one of the things that we say internally at HubSpot is that you can have a great strategy, but just alignment across products and go-to-market is even more important than strategy. And over the last 18 months, we have again focused on that alignment. And when we say alignment with a good market, it's like when we pour innovation to the enterprise tier, then there is an aligned sales motion where our sales reps with the partner ecosystem are talking to our customers about the value that we are getting, which is very powerful, right? So I think it's that coordinated effort across products, go-to-market and partners that drive that upmarket momentum, and we're going to continue to invest on that. Thanks, Brian, for the question. Look, it's consistent both in terms of North America as well as international. And in fact, in Q4, they both accelerated in terms of constant currency growth. I'd say, if you step back, what is common across North America and international is just the need for just a beautiful front-office platform. That is the demand that we see, both in terms of North America as well as international segments. And we just meet the needs right now, and we talked a lot about the product innovation. We've talked a lot about the improvements that we have had both on the product side and the go-to-market side. And I think we're firing kind of on all cylinders across the pillars. In terms of international, I'd say a couple of things. First off, it is a little bit of an earlier stage in some of the countries that we operate in. Customers are a bit earlier in digital transformation. And therefore, our market penetration is low. And therefore, there's momentum there. And then the second thing I'd say is that we have continued to invest in terms of product localization, customer-facing resources. And there's really good LTV-to-CAC and return on that LTV-to-CAC that we see in international markets. And so overall, we continue to invest in both of the markets and we're -- we like the balance in terms of the performance both internationally as well as in North America. Keith? I would think that -- Operations Hub, I think it's -- I talked a little bit about the Operations Hub and the value of Operations Hub that's really supercharging the other hubs. I think the broader point in terms of the mix that we see is just more multi-hub. We talked about it in the prepared remarks that -- 60% of our customer base being multi-hub. Now having introduced products like Operations Hub and CMS and also adding more value to our anchor hubs like Marketing and Sales, we just see a lot more of 2 hubs or 3 hub pairs, and that goes to show the overall value that our customers are getting from HubSpot. And so that's how I would think about it for last year as well as going into 2022. Yes. That's a great question. We've been talking about the overall pace of innovation and also the value that customers get. I would say like if I step back -- and I've been talking to a lot of customers in Q4 as well as January. There are a couple of really big challenges for small/medium businesses right now. There's just a huge challenge of trying to switch disparate systems that just don't work well. Small/medium businesses don't have the time. They don't have the budget. They don't have the technical teams that are sitting around unlike maybe some of the larger companies, and that's a huge challenge. The second part of the challenge is that they want to get payer visibility across the entire customer journey, but marketing and sales are still in silos, and they don't get that type of visibility to drive the growth that they need. And so HubSpot solves both of these challenges, and we become an easy and clear platform choice. And that's why our customers are adopting more hubs on average and getting more value per hub. And when I talk to customers, they're like, look, we don't even know when one of your hubs stops and the other one starts. It's seamless and it's just a beautiful customer experience. Plus we have added a lot to our overall ecosystem, which is the 1,000 integrations that we talked about. And it makes us an easier platform choice for small/medium businesses. And look, this is exactly what we want. We want to be the number 1 CRM platform for scaling businesses, and I think it really meets the need all customers within the segment. So we feel very good about it. Thank you, everyone. Great talking to you, and look forward to connecting back in the quarter. Thanks a lot."

Now it's my pleasure to turn over the call to HubSpot's Chief Executive Officer, Yamini Rangan, Yamini?\nYamini Rangan: Thanks, Chuck, and greetings, everyone. Thank you for joining us today as we review HubSpot's third quarter 2021 results. I hope you were all able to join us a few weeks ago for our Annual Analyst Day at INBOUND. We covered a lot of ground as part of those sessions.  So today, what I want to do is to focus on the great results in Q3 as well as the strategic pillars guiding us on our path to becoming the #1 CRM platform for scaling companies.  Let's kick things off with a look at our Q3 results. We're continuing to see strong performance across the business, with revenue growth of 47% in constant currency year-over-year, and total customers growing 34% year-over-year to more than 128,000. As we've seen over the past year, small and medium businesses continue to embrace our modern CRM to connect with their customers, drive insights from customer interactions and transform their businesses for the digital age.  Our strong results speak to the fact that HubSpot is providing the right foundation for these companies to scale. At our Analyst Day, I provided an overview of our long-term growth strategy and introduced the 4 strategic pillars guiding our investments.  So today, I'd like to share how our recent product announcements at INBOUND are helping us make meaningful progress towards our long-term goals. Our first strategic pillar is to deliver a world-class front-office platform by investing in new and existing hubs as well as driving the extensibility of our platform.  We're always looking for ways to address the evolving needs of our customers and expand our addressable market. We'll continue to explore the development of new hubs, invest in anchor hubs like marketing and sales and accelerate innovation around emerging hubs like Operations Hub.  Earlier this week, we officially launched Operations Hub Enterprise. This is a great example of how we are accelerating innovation in emerging hubs. As you all know, we first launched Operations Hub Starter and Professional earlier this year to help customers get all of their data into HubSpot and build more advanced automated workflows.  Now with Operations Hub Enterprise, our customers are able to report on that data in more connected and consistent ways to generate insights to drive growth. We also announced important improvements to Service Hub, including custom surveys and a new customer portal that's currently in public beta.  We'll continue to invest so that our individual hubs are powerful and easy to use. But we also know that much of HubSpot's magic comes from how our hubs seamlessly work together. And with more than half of our customers adopting multiple hubs, we know that more and more companies are realizing the unique advantage that comes from managing their entire front office in 1 platform.  A great example of this multi-hub approach in action is Triage, a staffing agency that arranges assignments for traveling nurses across the U.S. After connecting its back-office systems to our platform and implementing our marketing, sales, CMS and Operations Hub, Triage has seen increased efficiency and performance across the company. Their e-mail click-through rate doubled, their sales team's capacity grew by 60% and they are now able to quickly mobilize for flu or COVID vaccinations. There is still plenty of runway left when it comes to going broad and deep with our hubs and platforms. I'm really excited to see where the needs of our customers will take us next.  Our second strategic pillar is to strengthen our segmentation approach across product and go to market and this is driving product innovation at HubSpot in 2 key ways. First, we're bringing high-end features that have traditionally only been available to large enterprises down to our small and mid-market customers. And second, we're bringing a human-friendly product and purchasing experience traditionally seen in small and mid-market businesses up to large enterprises.  At INBOUND this year, we focused on the latter half of the strategy, announcing new, powerful and easy-to-use features that add tremendous value to our enterprise tier. In addition to new plant-wide governance features like permission sets and audit logging, we also launched SAM DOCSIS, a feature that enables customers to test changes to their portal without impacting their primary account.  In Marketing Hub Enterprise, we introduced Business Units, a new feature that enables customers to manage multiple brands to ensure a more consistent and targeted experience for their audiences. And new enterprise level forecasting tools in Sales Hub and Service Hub help managers keep track of their team's progress towards their goals. All of these enhancements help our larger customers customize their usage of HubSpot without adding complexity as they continue to grow.  We're seeing success in our segmentation approach. On the high end, we are consistently closing more large deals and have seen an 81% year-over-year increase in Q3 large deals.  Our Starter addition is also fueling customer acquisitions. That segment has grown from a small percentage of our customer base a few years ago to more than 50% of our total customers as of Q3.  Now let's turn to our third pillar, investing in commerce and payments. As I discussed during our Analyst Day, commerce has traditionally been thought of as an extension of the back office. It was sold to finance leaders, it was about collecting revenue and driving cost efficiencies. But commerce as a part of CRM is fundamentally different and it's about enabling growth, not saving money.  We're excited about the long-term opportunity for an integrated payment solution. That said, we're still in very early stages of this opportunity, and there are years of runway for growth. For now, we're focused on reaching U.S.-based B2B companies with fewer than 100 employees so that we can deliver a strong product to market fit before expanding internationally.  Having the product market fit in 1 geography ensures that we -- when we go international, we're able to capture a significant portion of GMV of any country we enter. And while it's only been available for about a month, we have seen nice momentum with our open beta as customers tap into the ability to quickly and easily start taking payments.  One early adopter is ZenPilot, an operations consulting business that needed to scale operations but was being held back by a labor-intensive payment system. ZenPilot's previous system could only process credit card transactions and required manual work to process payments via ACH.  With HubSpot Payments, ZenPilot is able to accept ACH payments with ease. The sales team is able to focus more on lead generation activities and therefore, have increased leads by 30%.  The early feedback from customers like ZenPilot is evidence that we are on the right path in enabling our B2B customers to deliver a consumer-grade buying experience. I'm very excited about what the future holds for HubSpot payments in the long term.  Our fourth and final pillar is to continue to scale HubSpot. As you've heard Brian and Dharmesh say before, we want to build a company that future generations can be proud of. As part of that vision, we're investing in hiring and growing diverse talent, working on our environmental initiatives, and doubling down on protecting our customers' data and scaling our systems to meet their needs.  By investing in these 4 pillars, we're building a strong foundation that will serve both HubSpot and our customers as we chart our next phase of growth. I'm incredibly excited about our long-term opportunity, and I'm very confident that we have the right strategy, the right investments and the right team in place to help us execute and win.  With that, I'll turn it over to Kate to give an overview of our fantastic financial results. Kate?\nKathryn Bueker: Thanks, Yamini. Let's turn to our third quarter financial results and our guidance for the fourth quarter and full year of 2021. Third quarter revenue grew 47% year-over-year in constant currency and 49% as reported. Q3 subscription revenue grew 49% year-over-year, while services and other revenue increased 39%, both on an as-reported basis.  The momentum we've seen over the last 1.5 years continued into the third quarter with broad strength across the business. We saw continued strength in revenue retention in Q3, trending nicely above our new target level of 110% with healthy customer dollar retention continuing to be a big driver of our overall strong retention performance.  Net revenue retention also continues to benefit from multiple upgrade drivers including strong cross-sell activity and seat expansions. Domestic revenue grew 41% year-over-year in Q3, while international revenue growth was 54% in constant currency and 58% as reported. While our international and domestic revenue growth rates in constant currency remained flat quarter-over-quarter, international revenue as a percentage of total revenue increased 3 points year-over-year to 46%.  We added 7,100 net customers in the quarter, growing our total customer count by 34% year-over-year to 128,000. Average subscription revenue per customer grew 9% year-over-year to $10,500 as we saw a continued positive mix shift towards our professional and enterprise tiers, along with strong installed base selling.  As we've discussed over the last couple of quarters, we expect these trends to continue into Q4 with net customer additions of about 7,000 and high single-digit year-over-year growth in ASRPC. Deferred revenue as of the end of September was $376 million, a 45% increase year-over-year.  Calculated billings was $353 million growing 45% year-over-year in constant currency and 43% as reported. Billings growth in Q3 was impacted by the strong installed base selling mix in the quarter, slightly lower billing duration and a more difficult comparison as a result of COVID-related customer plays in the year ago period.  The remainder of my comments will refer to non-GAAP measures. Third quarter gross margin was 80%, down 2 points year-over-year as a result of increased customer usage and the launch of our new EU data center. Subscription gross margin was 83%, while services gross margin was negative 9%.  Third quarter operating margin was 10%, up 2 points compared to the same period a year ago. At the end of the third quarter, we had nearly 5,500 employees, up 38% year-over-year. Net income in the third quarter was $26 million or $0.50 per fully diluted share.  CapEx, including capitalized software development costs, was $16 million or 5% of revenue in Q3. Free cash flow in the quarter was $38 million or 11% of revenue. We continue to expect CapEx as a percentage of revenue to be about 5% in 2021 and now expect free cash flow to be about $180 million for the full year. Finally, our cash and marketable securities totaled $1.3 billion at the end of September.  And with that, let's dive into guidance for the fourth quarter and full year of 2021. For the fourth quarter, total revenue is expected to be in the range of $356 million to $358 million, up 42% year-over-year at the midpoint. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be between $34 million and $36 million. Non-GAAP diluted net income per share is expected to be between $0.52 and $0.54. This assumes 50.9 million fully diluted shares outstanding.  And for the full year of 2021, total revenue is now expected to be in the range of $1.287 billion to $1.289 billion, up 46% year-over-year at the midpoint. Non-GAAP operating income is now expected to be between $113 million and $115 million. Non-GAAP diluted net income per share is now expected to be between $1.76 and $1.78. This assumes 50.7 million fully diluted shares outstanding.  As you adjust your models, keep in mind the following: At current spot rates, we expect FX to be a slight headwind to as reported revenue in Q4 and still expect a 3-point tailwind for the full year.  And with that, I'll hand things back over to Yamini for her closing remarks.\nRangan: Thanks a lot, Kate. Before we wrap up, I want to extend a huge thank you to our customers, partners and employees for your support over the last quarter. It was such a joy to connect with you all during INBOUND, and I have felt so welcomed and energized as I transitioned into the CEO role.  As you heard me talk about at INBOUND, we're now in the age of the customer. Customers want and expect a frictionless connected consumer-like buying experience at every step of their journey. Fortunately, we've been building for this new era at HubSpot and are uniquely suited to meet the moment as evidenced in this quarter's strong financial results.  Our most recent product announcements are designed to help companies create customer relationship magic and our 4 strategic pillars will enable us to continue to deliver on our mission of helping millions of companies grow better in the future.  And with that, operator, please open up the call for some questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research.\nAleksandr Zukin: Congratulations on a great quarter. Yamini, maybe the first one for you, particularly on the demand environment. Can you talk about what you saw in the quarter? Did you see any seasonality, summer holiday weakness internationally?  And then obviously in the news, we're hearing -- we see headlines of supply chain issues. You hear the reports of the advertising companies having a little bit of consternation. Are you seeing any impact from that at all? And any commentary on kind of the pipeline for either new customer growth or existing customer expansion into Q4?\nYamini Rangan: Alex, thanks a lot for the question. We are seeing the same headlines that you mentioned in terms of supply chain challenges, macro environment. But I'll say that there's not a set of factors that have outsized exposure to here at HubSpot. In terms of the demand environment and the demand patterns, it's really solid.  And if I step back and look at why we feel very good about the demand environment, it's 2 things. One, the world has changed. Since the start of the pandemic, customers have looked for digital solutions and the buyer expectations have changed pretty significantly where they need a consumer-like buying experiences. They want to be able to connect to their customers digitally and they want to be able to grow and accelerate growth in this environment.  And two, we have the perfect solution for that. HubSpot has a very unique value proposition. We have crafted the solution and we provide consumer-like user experience with enterprise-grade features, and that is resonating really well in terms of the market. So I feel very good about the demand environment and what we are seeing in the pipeline.  And this reflects both across our North America business as well as international business. So feeling pretty good.\nAleksandr Zukin: Got it. And then -- that's super helpful. And Kate, for you, I mean, I think look, one of the questions I know I'm going to get tomorrow is for the last, I don't know, call it, 6 quarters or so, billings has been ahead of revenue growth in the quarter, even on an adjusted basis, from a constant currency perspective. This quarter, you mentioned there were some headwinds on the billings that is important to take into account. So maybe can you just walk through them, particularly on the deferred side what you're seeing and why it's not necessarily indicative of -- I mean it's usually not indicative, but in this case specifically, why it wouldn't be indicative of kind of the way to think about future revenue growth? Because I think your guidance suggests again, also very strong growth for Q4 subscription revenue.\nKathryn Bueker: Yes. Sure thing. I would just start by saying that we actually feel really good about delivering constant currency billings growth in the mid-40s, especially when you look at the sort of tougher comparison that we have here in Q3 relative to Q2, it's basically 12-or-so points more difficult.  Also what I did mention a few things that were headwinds to constant currency billings in the quarter. There's a little bit of a headwind from duration. And you may recall in my prepared remarks that I noted that this was a very strong installed base selling quarter that also has a little bit of a headwind as it relates to billings particularly around deferred revenue. FX on deferred is very tricky and you may recall, in particular that the euro weakened against the dollar pretty dramatically over the course of Q3.  And so the impact on deferred revenue from FX was much more acute. There is about a 4-point headwind to deferred revenue on a constant currency basis versus an as-reported basis [Technical Difficulty].\nCharles MacGlashing: Mark, are you there?\nMark Murphy: Yes, I'm here. Sorry, I never heard my name called. So I don't know if I was disconnected for a moment. But that's the case.\nCharles MacGlashing: You can go ahead, Mr. Morgan.\nMark Murphy: Yes. I'm flattered to be called Mr. Morgan. So Yamini, at the Analyst Day, you had mentioned the touchless sale. And I think the fact that most B2B companies haven't started on it yet. I'm wondering how is that vision of the touchless sale resonating with your customers who are in this open beta of HubSpot payments? And what is their feedback to you so far?\nYamini Rangan: Yes. Great question, Mark. So at the Analyst Day, what I said was that in terms of, there are 2 ways that companies typically sell. One is the touchless sale and then the other is the rep-assisted sale. Now in terms of cashless sales, B2B companies haven't just gotten started in terms of online processing of services and software. And our hypothesis is that we can really help them and enable new revenue streams for a company.  Now in the prepared remarks, I mentioned an example of a company, ZenPilot. They are in the consulting business. They wanted to start processing and that's an example of a touchless sales -- In terms of the open beta, that's also where we are seeing interest, Mark. We're seeing companies that are in services that are thinking about new online revenue streams that haven't done it before, and this is an easy and seamless way for them to grow. It's pretty early days. It's -- we've been in open beta just for a few weeks here now, but we're definitely seeing interest in terms of opening new revenue streams. So we'll keep watching.\nMark Murphy: Okay. Understood. And as a quick follow-up, Kate, we're noticing the growth is superb Sequentially, revenue growth is actually stronger than pre-pandemic in Q3. So -- it's interesting to see the growth is stronger without reliance upon a blowout number of customer adds. So I'm just curious where are you seeing the ASP increase most noticeably, part of what I'm wondering is custom objects unlocking some of the larger accounts at the top of your target range with the Enterprise Hubs of sales and marketing? Or is it more across the board or even more kind of down-market?\nKathryn Bueker: Yes. Thanks for the question. I think the good news is that our KPIs of customer additions and ASRPC kind of came in exactly where we told you that they were going to. We did see that nice pickup in ASRPC, really in that high single-digit range.  And again, that positive momentum in ASRPC is a mix-driven calculation. The customer mix is moving towards that Pro and Enterprise. And we, again, I'll highlight the strong installed base selling commentary for Q3. And both of those things are, like, key drivers of ASRPC growth.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Samad Samana with Jefferies.\nSamad Samana: I'll echo the congrats on just a great quarter even as the comps get tougher. So maybe first, Yamini, for you, I have a follow-up on the payment side. Can you talk about the front office CRM approach HubSpot is taking to payments and the advantages that HubSpot has over other more entrenched back-office-centric competitors that are more closely tied to accounting systems?\nYamini Rangan: Thank you, Samad. That's really like my favorite question about payments because the way we think about payments, commerce is part of -- CRM is fundamentally different. It is about enabling revenue growth for our customers. And it's very, very different from commerce as part of back office, where traditionally, it is about talking to the finance leader and focusing on collecting revenues and cost efficiency.  And over the past few quarters, as we have gone back to our customers and asked them how we can enable growth, it became really clear that we needed to embed commerce and payments as part of CRM. And there are 3 ways in which we can drive that growth.  The first one is what I just talked about with Mark's question, which is enabling new revenue team. So if you think about touchless, this is not where B2B companies have traditionally focused, and so we want to enable new revenue streams and provide opportunities for growth there.  The second area for growth is really helping with the rep assisted last-mile sale. So what I mean by that is HubSpot historically, we have focused on rep-assisted sales. But the last mile, which is core to cash has been the hardest nut to crack. And we want to focus on that. We want to streamline, simplify it so that the reps can now focus on growth initiatives on demand-generation activities. And so we do that right, we're going to actually enable growth for our customers.  And then the third thing which I'm super excited about is commerce brings context to every customer interaction. If you can imagine, having a commerce object deeply embedded within CRM, you now have more information when you run marketing campaigns. You can run marketing campaigns on abandoned cart. You have much more information in terms of sales interactions because you know where the invoice stands. You have much better service interactions because it's prioritized by the purchase history. So commerce deeply embedded CRM is just really valuable in terms of enabling growth. And so I think we're taking a very different approach and enabling growth for our customers. So I'm excited about the longer-term opportunity here.\nSamad Samana: Very helpful. And then maybe a follow-up for Kate. The 47% growth on constant currency staying the same quarter-over-quarter despite a tougher comp was impressive. And I think one of the things related to that is the stat around an 81% increase in large deals in the third quarter.  I haven't really heard the company talk about large deals, more, just which SKU is being adopted. So I'm curious if you can maybe just help us understand how we should think about large deals and how you're defining it? And then maybe just how should we think about that going forward from a contribution standpoint?\nKathryn Bueker: Yes. I think I talked a little bit about the Analyst Day when we tried to highlight the strategic pillar around segmentation. Internally, we look at what we call large deals as anything that is greater than $3,000 MRR. And we've seen that the volume of those deals increased 81% year-over-year.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ken Wong with Guggenheim Securities.\nKen Wong: First question, I just wanted to get a sense for I think earlier it was mentioned some of the advertising peers out there are running into kind of the occasional issues with the IDFA. How do you see that potentially impacting HubSpot's business? Does that push customers more towards an INBOUND strategy? Would love to see if you guys are running in any tailwinds, headwinds on that front.\nDharmesh Shah: Thanks for the question, Ken. So just taking a step back, the -- the reason we get into trouble sometimes in our personal lives and get sent to the doghouse is when we forget things like an anniversary or birthday. The reason we get set into the doghouse in a privacy-centric world is when we remember and know too much.  And that's, I think, what's caused some of the recent developments here. Now having said that, HubSpot's genesis in the beginning, as you noted, has been around this idea of INBOUND marketing, which is a very kind of consumer-friendly privacy-forward approach. And we've kind of stuck to that for all 15 of our years.  So as developments have happened in the industry that are kind of moving privacy forward, they've been neutral to positive to HubSpot. And some of the recent developments, I don't think are any different, specifically on some of the app tracking stuff that's happened recently, the companies most impacted are the ones that if you're running a massive advertiser network where you're running a massive mobile applications for which tracking is super important, you're going to feel the direct impact of some of these recent changes, HubSpot doesn't fall into either of those categories. So we don't really expect any meaningful impact on our business at all as a result of some of the interesting developments that are happening.\nKen Wong: Got it. I really appreciate that Dharmesh. And then, Kate, just thinking about the shape of the quarter. I think in the past, you guys had mentioned that, I think, in July, HubSpotters were given a break also potentially saw higher than typical PTO. Any sense of kind of how the kind of the linearity played out from July through September and to the extent that you can comment on October, November kind of how that demand life cycle looks?\nKathryn Bueker: Yes. I mean I think I'll stick to Q3, but you're exactly right and have a great memory. We made a decision to give the organization a break at the very beginning of the quarter, and we had a global decompress for all of our employees. And that obviously creates a bit of a slow start to the quarter. We feel great about where we landed for the full quarter, but we definitely saw momentum in the second couple of months as a result of that, I would say, well-deserved break on behalf of our employees.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Stan Zlotsky with Morgan Stanley.\nStan Zlotsky: Perfect. I wanted to touch on the payments business a little bit. I'm sure you're getting a lot of questions from investors on that one. How are you thinking as far as, like, disclosing the traction that you're seeing in that business as it starts to ramp? What are the milestones that we should be looking for and you'll be looking for as far as really just broadening out the initial set of customers that are involved in the beta program?\nYamini Rangan: Stan, thanks for the question. I'm going to maybe address this from a broad strategic perspective and then I'll have Kate to address it in terms of how we'll be tracking it. As you heard us talk about at the Analyst Day, this is a long-term opportunity that we are very, very excited about.  And specifically, we have a targeted approach. The target market that we're going after U.S. companies with 100 employees or less that are B2B, mostly focused on services and software. The reason we are focused on that market is, first, it allows us to build a delightful product experience that customers can love.  And even within that market, we see it as a pretty large market, tens of billions in GMV within that segment. And we want to start with that market. And we're going to make sure that in terms of both the payment features as well as commerce features, we are focused delivering and driving market adoption and I think longer term, there is a significant opportunity for us to grow both upmarket domestically as well as international. And I'll pass it to Kate so she can address your question on how we will track and share our results.\nKathryn Bueker: Yes. Thanks, Yamini. So if I just take a step back and look at the specific customer segment that Yamini outlined in the U.S.-based customers with 100 or less employees in that sort of B2B software and services space, as Yamini said we think that's a tens-of-billions-of-dollars-of-GMV market for us. And that would translate into something that looks more like hundreds of millions of potential payment volume for us over the next couple of years.  And as I covered at the Analyst Day, HubSpot's going to earn a transaction fee on this payment volume. And the amount of that transaction fee is going to depend on the payment method. It's going to depend on the transaction size, and we will recognize that fee as revenue to HubSpot. There'll be an associated cost with that transaction, most notably for credit card transaction that's it, that interchange fee. And so the gross margin for the payments business is going to be a much different and lower gross margin than what were used on the software side.  That said, the sales expense in growing the business is also going to be very different than the core software business, and we feel really good about the overall margin for HubSpot over time with respect to payments.  We will likely, in the near term, record any revenue under that what we call services and other revenue stream. And as we ramp up over time, we will have to evaluate when it is the appropriate time to break that revenue out.\nStan Zlotsky: Got it. Got it. And then, Kate, just wanted to go back to billings for a quick second. I mean I think you did a great job of outlining the FX -- material FX headwind to billings at the end of the quarter versus the FX tailwind that we actually saw in revenue. But just on the duration component of billings, if you were to kind of just put together the overall kind of headwinds that you saw in the quarter to billings between FX and duration, which one was the more material one? And kind of maybe give us a little bit of a magnitude of what the billings duration headwind may have been as well?\nKathryn Bueker: Yes. So the FX headwind to billings overall was, net, was 2% headwind, right? And that's a combination, as you are indicating of a tailwind to revenue with a more extreme headwind to the deferred revenue component of billings. In terms of the relative impact of duration versus FX, I think it's a combination of duration and the fact that, that we have a higher mix of installed base selling that sort of make up the other part of the difference between constant currency revenue and constant currency billings.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brad Sills with Bank of America Securities.\nBradley Sills: Congratulations on a nice quarter. Maybe I'll ask another question on the ASP question in another way. With the kind of growth you're seeing there, net revenue retention has been accelerating now for several quarters. Are customers landing with multiple hubs more so than in the past? I think historically, we think of HubSpot where a customer will start with marketing or sales or CMS, those are great entry points and then you'll see the cross-sell a year or 2 later.  Now that you're kind of moving up market and there's more enterprise additions, are you seeing customers commit to multi-hubs kind of an initial land deal more so? And what does that mean for kind of future expansion opportunity potentially?\nYamini Rangan: Brad, thanks for the question. I'd say that we see 3 things that happen across our customer base. The first is, what you said, which is more multi-hub. And you can see that reflected in the numbers that Kate shared at the Analyst Day. And so we definitely see the multi-hub customers land.  We're seeing still really good front doors with marketing, sales hubs. Each of those hubs have gotten really good over the past 12 to 18 months. And so they are very good front doors. And so we see that land-and-expand motion.  And then as you know, we launched the CRM suite, both at the starter level as well as the go level and those are also really good front doors. And so across the board, we are seeing all 3 motions.  Now I will say in terms of multi-hub, when our customers adopt multi-hub, the value that they get because it's a seamless user interface because it's a single data model because there is a single view of the customer. It's just much higher.  We see when customers adopt Sales Hub plus Marketing Hubs, they get much more leased when they just had Marketing Hub or sales sub loans, the same powerful combination with Marketing Hub and CMS Hub or Sales Hub and Service Hub.  And so I think what you're seeing is that there are great front doors into adoption. There is also a growing trend towards multi-hub as well as suite adoption. The combination of all 3 are kind of what you see as results in terms of ASRPC growth.\nBradley Sills: Great to hear. And then one on the Service Hub, if I may. There's kind of a view that service -- customer service is more of an upmarket-type solution, small businesses don't necessarily run a separate support desk and a lot of it can be done within sales. As you guys -- well, one, do you agree with that view? And then two, as you guys are moving into this kind of upmarket business, more enterprise focused, could we expect perhaps an acceleration we've already seen good strong results out of Service Hub, but potentially even greater attach there?\nDharmesh Shah: Yes. So it's -- in terms of Service adoption or interest on the lower end. We don't think it's relegated just to larger enterprises. We think an increasing number of customers want to provide online support, even if it's not a call center, it might be over e-mail or over a chat. So that is definitely a need.  In terms of Service Hub, the product is doing really well. And the path that we're kind of progressing is similar to what you saw with sales up over the last several years, which there are some key features that -- what we're looking for in sales of -- and custom objects was one of them.  And once we start knocking those dominoes over, we see the adoption rate go up. And then we see that hub becoming an on-ramp and front door to the HubSpot platform. We think something similar will happen with Service Hub. We just recently launched at a recent INBOUND, the feature of a customer portal where customers can log in and see their tickets and interact with their data and with their accounts. That was one of those big dominoes in our minds that the customers have been kind of asking for repeatedly and it puts us further down the path where we need to be.  So we think 2022 is going to be an exciting year for Service Hub. The market opportunity is massive across our sector of 1,000 to 2,000 employee customers, and we're -- we sort of know what the customer needs are, and we're just looking to execute.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Peterson with Raymond James.\nBrian Peterson: I actually wanted to follow up Yamini, your answer to Brad's question. And I'd be curious to what extent customers are really kind of understanding of what this new frontier is going to look like for digital engagement models? And I say that because are they still at the point or I guess are they at the point now where they're willing to kind of buy, not even just 1 or 2, but 3 or 4 hubs at once, right?  Or are they seeing that digitally across all hubs or all channels -- or is it -- do they have the vision or are they still going to have to kind of pick 1 at a time just given maybe their limited ability to execute? I'm curious what you're hearing from customers in regards to this new frontier in terms of digital engagement.\nYamini Rangan: It's a good question, Brian. I think it's across the board, the levels of maturity within our customer base are quite different. So you have some customers that are pretty early, and this -- they've realized in the past couple of years that they need to be digital-first, digital-ready, and they are kind of putting their toe and starting with one hub and then expanding.  And then there are customers like the use case example that I gave in the prepared remarks of Triage where they realize that they need complete digital front office platform that is all in one in order for them to be able to accelerate their growth given all of what they're seeing.  And so it really depends on the maturity of the customers. And the one thing that I would say is that our approach has been resonating really well with customers. We've taken a very, very different approach to building and crafting our solutions, and it's unique. So customers don't have to cobble together a bunch of different applications within their tech stack. They can start with 1 or multi-hub or go all in, but the crafted way in which we approach building products and therefore, the value that our customers see in our full suite is really resonating within the market.\nBrian Peterson: Great. That's good to hear. Maybe a quick follow-up for Kate. One of the bullish takeaways for me at the Analyst Day was the net revenue retention above 110. I believe you indicated it, that would kind of be the new normal going forward. I think I have that right. But I'm curious, how can we frame that in terms of the average revenue per customer trend? I know it's not the same cohort overall. But should we think about that maybe lagging the 110 figure by a couple of points? I'm just curious if there's any read-through from the NRR that we should be looking at in terms of the revenue per customer growth?\nKathryn Bueker: Yes. Thanks for the question. I think that you are right at Analyst Day, we shared a new target level for net revenue retention at or above 110%. And what we talked about was a couple of different drivers. The first of those drivers was really strong customer dollar retention. That's what we call it internally; may refer to it as gross retention.  And what we said is about half of the impact on total net revenue retention was associated with improvements on customer dollar retention. The other piece of that is that our upgrades are improving, and we have a diverse set of upgrade drivers that are helping to increase net revenue retention that sort of second half, those drivers will also help drive ASRPC growth, right? So it's not that retention is driving. It's the same core adoption of a greater portion of the platform that is driving both the net revenue retention and higher ASRPC.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Turits with KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nMichael Turits: So two questions. Yamini, for you. Obviously, everyone is very excited about the payments. Can you talk about how you're thinking longer term about e-commerce more broadly? And then I've for Kate.\nYamini Rangan: I think like, yes, we are excited about payments that we're equally excited about the core business, I will say that. In terms of the longer-term payment opportunity, if we really step back, there is just a lot that we can do to help our customers grow.  And the way we are going to focus on this, and we've said this in a couple of different ways, is that, first of all, from a payments perspective, we're going to just embed this in almost every way. Embedded payments, which as the name suggests is embedding it informed in web pages in meeting requests and really, that will help us drive adoption. And so from a road map, you will see us drive payment adoption.  I think the second part of what I'm excited about in the road map is building that commerce context into CRM and vice versa. That's where we see significant value that we can deliver to our customers by making sure that the commerce context is there in every interaction, whether it's marketing or sales or service, and both of those are going to open up a huge opportunity for us, but also it's going to enable growth for our customers.  So that's how we think about the road map and longer-term opportunity in terms of payments. But I'll also point that -- as we've talked about, the core business is really strong, and the core business is growing really well, and we're continuing to invest in terms of all of our strategic pillars and focused on driving a world-class CRM platform. So it's kind of balanced across new opportunities as well as core business.\nMichael Turits: And then Kate, you said that for '22, not to expect a meaningful improvement in margins. Can you just talk about what some of the puts and takes are there and how they may or may not be shifting in terms of what's the headwind and what's the tailwind to margins how that balances out next year?\nKathryn Bueker: Yes. I guess the way that I would think about it is -- and we tried to talk a bit about this at the Analyst Day was how we balance growth and profitability. And overall, if you just sort of at the highest level, think about it, what we have been trying to do and what we continue to try to do is focus on building really durable long-term growth for the company. And we will clearly look for ways on a regular basis to expand margins. And we leverage our long-term financial framework to try to do that.  What we don't want to do is forgo really high conviction, really high return opportunities to drive future growth so that we can deliver very specific leverage targets from one year to the next. And so you heard us talk about it at the Analyst Day you hear Yamini talk about it. Now we feel really good about the opportunity in front of us, and we want to make sure that we continue to invest into that opportunity.  And so the areas where you're going to see us invest in 2022 are going to be the same areas where you've been seeing us invest over the last couple of years. In particular, we want to make sure that we are leaning into our R&D organization to drive innovation because we think that's the engine for strong and durable growth. So I don't have specific puts and takes in 2022 but what I would tell you is we're going to continue to invest in the places where we have been seeing strong ROI, and we believe that we can continue to see strong ROI and that's primarily in the innovation of the product.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo.\nMichael Berg: This is Michael Berg on for Michael Turrin. Congrats on a great quarter. I have a quick question and then a follow-up for Dharmesh. In this environment we're seeing right now, it appears to be a pretty strong or difficult hiring environment. And with HubSpot being such a focus on culture and retention, can you kind of walk through what you're seeing in the hiring environment? Any trouble getting people on board any better or worse retention within your employee base?\nDharmesh Shah: Thanks for your question. So it's -- we're really pleased with the kind of long-term investments we've made in culture and employer brand that has really paid off now in these tough times. So we haven't seen a direct impact of the so-called kind of Great Resignation, but we know that there's some activity going out there and the world at large. But we continue to have a very strong employer brand. We leaned in even pre-pandemic into this notion of a hybrid and remote workforce, which we're even better at now.  So personally, I feel we're coming from a position of strength even more so than we were before. I think the value of our culture, the value of the flexibility we have in our workforce is appreciated. We've long said that we think of culture as a second product that we build. And that product, including our main product is actually doing very well. So thanks for the question.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Parker Lane with Stifel.\nJeffrey Lane: At the Analyst Day, you mentioned about 60% of the business is coming direct versus the remainder coming from solution partners. Wondering if you could break down what the composition of that looks like in the enterprise customers here, particularly with some of the go-to-market investments you've made there over the past year.\nKathryn Bueker: So Parker, thanks a lot for the question. Broadly speaking, that's right. I think -- but if you kind of break it down between our segments, partners focus much more on upmarket for all the obvious reasons. More customer -- more integration, more CRM implementations, more customization. And so it's weighted a little bit higher towards the upmarket segment.  And look, our strategy has been very, very clear in terms of working with our Solution Partner ecosystem. If you historically look at the Solution Partner ecosystem, it's about 4,000 strong. They were marketing agencies, but we have done a lot of investments to diversify that Solution Partner ecosystem, and we're very pleased with the level of expertise in helping our upmarket customers.  It's one of those competitive moats for us. They do a fantastic job of understanding our customers as well as our products. And when partners get engaged, we see high customer dollar retention as well as revenue retention. And we understand that, we had an event right after INBOUND for partners where we talked about our strategy and doubling down in our strategy of selling and servicing with them, and we're making pretty hefty investments in enabling partners, matching partners with customers and building expertise within the solution partner base. And so we're excited to see that ecosystem thrive.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Rishi Jaluria with RBC Markets.\nRishi Jaluria: Just one from my end. I wanted to drill back on to some of the upmarket penetration. Yamini, I think that 81% increase in large deals year-over-year in Q3 really, really and great to see that. Maybe can you help us understand with this upmarket penetration, how you're kind of balancing the investments that you're making there with wanting to keep that same e-commerce-type approach and self-service approach that has worked for you historically. And maybe directionally, can you give us a sense for with these larger customers, what sort of impact that tends to have on your net dollar retention?\nYamini Rangan: Rishi, thanks for the question. I think it really goes back to our strategic pillar, which is strengthening our segmentation approach. So both at the Analyst Day as well as prepared remarks, we talked about the investments we are making to make sure that every one of our segments are optimized.  We have broadly key segments. You've heard us speak about this, 1 to 20 segments where we are investing in product-led growth. The 20 to 200 segment, which is our traditional sweet spot from both a product and go-to-market perspective and the upmarket segment, which is the 200 to 2,000 segment, where we're making a lot of investments. And as we've mentioned before, we are being very thoughtful and deliberate in making product as well as go-to-market investments.  Our clear view is that both of these need to be in complete lockstep in terms of execution. So the success that you're seeing with the upmarket is one, because of the product. We have worked on the product extensively, and we've talked about wanting to maintain a consumer-grade look and feel while investing in powerful features and that is beginning to work. And in terms of go-to-market, we have invested in sales enablement, partner enablement as well as brand marketing efforts.  And so the results of our segmentation strategy is what is reflected both in terms of customer dollar retention as well as revenue retention. And this is kind of what Kate mentioned earlier in her comments about revenue retention.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ryan MacDonald with Needham & Company.\nRyan MacDonald: Yamini, in the last, I guess, two questions. You've talked about sort of the upmarket motion here. And I wanted to focus in on the partner channel and how that's driving up market deals. And -- you announced the launch of Operations Hub. It's only been a whole 2 days since it's officially launched. But just curious, since the announcement of INBOUND, what sort of feedback you've gotten from the partner channel on that offering? And how you think that can continue to maybe unlock the higher end or the upper market segment of your business over time?\nYamini Rangan: Thank you so much, Ryan, for the question. Yes, the Operations Hub Enterprise was just launched this week. And as you all know, we launched Operations Hub Starter as well as Pro earlier this year in April. And that's actually an example of one of the hubs where we co-launched it with partners.  Our partner community has been just incredibly involved in terms of the beta program. They were incredibly involved in terms of identifying early use cases. And we co-launched Operations Hub. In fact, that launch event was probably the highest NPS partner event that we have had all year. And the feedback from partners in terms of Operations Hub has been very, very promising as well as positive.  Now the broader point in terms of how we are enabling go-to-market with partners upmarket. As we optimize our product investments as well as go-to-market investments, we've been working hand-in-hand with partners in driving expertise within the partner ecosystem to enable them to take more complex implementations and that's beginning to work. And I'm very pleased with how our direct teams partner teams have been working collaboratively this year.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Arjun Bhatia with William Blair.\nArjun Bhatia: Kate, maybe one for you. It seems like a lot of the trends that we've been talking about with suite expansion, including multi-hub adoption, upsell, suite adoption. Those are -- those don't necessarily seem like temporary trends. So when we look out beyond Q4, should we think of the model as having structurally shifted where ACV growth can remain in that mid, high single-digit range, not just in Q4, but in 2022 and beyond as well?\nKathryn Bueker: Yes. Thanks for the question. I think what we have shared, Arjun, is that we feel like the trends that we saw in Q2 and in Q3 are going to continue into Q4. In terms of longer term, these are not metrics that we manage the business against. And you heard Yamini talk about the segmentation strategy where we intend to innovate both at that upmarket, but also with the Velocity segment that is more lower end. And as we innovate at one end or another year to continue to see movement in both of those KPIs.  So I think it's fair to say that in the short term. But over the longer term, we're going to continue to see a little bit more volatility.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore.\nStewart Materne: I was wondering if you could just talk about whether any of the trends that you're seeing in the upper part of your business -- upper market part of your business are different if you looked at the U.S. versus maybe internationally. I'm just kind of curious if uptake of Service Cloud, content management, are those products being taken up internationally at the same rate in the U.S.? Or is it similar to what we've seen in other SaaS companies where international tends to follow the U.S. I know you all are much more balanced. So I was just curious on that.\nYamini Rangan: Yes, we've been very, very balanced in terms of both international growth as well as North America growth. And as you heard us talk about, international is about 46% of our revenue and consistently growing really well.  In terms of adoption trends, it's quite similar. In a lot of international markets, they are still a bit earlier in terms of digital transformation and adoption of digital products. But overall, for example, Operations Hub has done really well there. And going multi-hub with CMS and marketing has done quite well there. And so the trends are pretty consistent across both of the markets.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Siti Panigrahi with Mizuho.\nMatt Diamond: This is actually Matt Diamond on Siti's behalf. One quick one. I'm curious about the magnitude of customer engagement that came after the INBOUND conference. If you could compare that to years past, that would be super helpful.\nYamini Rangan: That's a good question. Overall, INBOUND, the product announcements, very, very favorable positive feedback from customers. We had really good engagement both in terms of the breakouts as well as the spotlight sessions and the NPS for some of the sessions were better than even last year.  So overall, INBOUND landed really well. The engagement of our customers has been really good and feedback in terms of the announcements there, Operations Hub Enterprise, Sandbox, Business Units, the feedback for a lot of those features that we announced at INBOUND has been very, very positive. It's still early days. It's just been a couple of weeks since INBOUND. And so we'll likely see more momentum in Q4 based on the announcements at INBOUND.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Terry Tillman with Truist.\nJoseph Meares: This is actually Joe Meares on for Terry Tillman. You talked a lot about the product announcements, I think, on the call, but I'm just wondering from a very high level of the 3 major announcements that you guys made which have customers made the most noise about in the last 3 weeks since the Analyst Day?\nYamini Rangan: That's a good question. I think I broadly categorized our product announcements in 3 areas. The first one is Operations Hub Enterprise that we just launched in November, really positive feedback. We've seen very good momentum not just for the Enterprise product, but also for the Pro as well as Starter releases earlier this year.  So we're seeing consistent good feedback there. I think the second class is just a lot of the upmarket-related big powerhouse features that we launched, right? So you heard us talk about Business Units, which, again, is another domino feature within Marketing Hub Enterprise. You heard us talk about Sandboxes and forecasting, which is pretty big in terms of sales.  So a lot of customers that have been looking or will need this in the future are excited about that category of features. And then Payments. Payments is early days, but a lot of customers are engaged in conversations in terms of how they can we had new revenue streams and as well as enable consumer-like buying experiences. And so those 3, I would say, are probably the big categories of interactions with customers.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time, Yamini Rangan. I turn the call back over to you.\nYamini Rangan: Thank you so much. It was great seeing a lot of you at INBOUND and do great work in Q4. We'll see you in the new year.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Dharmesh Shah",
            "content": "Thanks for the question, Ken. So just taking a step back, the -- the reason we get into trouble sometimes in our personal lives and get sent to the doghouse is when we forget things like an anniversary or birthday. The reason we get set into the doghouse in a privacy-centric world is when we remember and know too much.  And that's, I think, what's caused some of the recent developments here. Now having said that, HubSpot's genesis in the beginning, as you noted, has been around this idea of INBOUND marketing, which is a very kind of consumer-friendly privacy-forward approach. And we've kind of stuck to that for all 15 of our years.  So as developments have happened in the industry that are kind of moving privacy forward, they've been neutral to positive to HubSpot. And some of the recent developments, I don't think are any different, specifically on some of the app tracking stuff that's happened recently, the companies most impacted are the ones that if you're running a massive advertiser network where you're running a massive mobile applications for which tracking is super important, you're going to feel the direct impact of some of these recent changes, HubSpot doesn't fall into either of those categories. So we don't really expect any meaningful impact on our business at all as a result of some of the interesting developments that are happening. Yes. So it's -- in terms of Service adoption or interest on the lower end. We don't think it's relegated just to larger enterprises. We think an increasing number of customers want to provide online support, even if it's not a call center, it might be over e-mail or over a chat. So that is definitely a need.  In terms of Service Hub, the product is doing really well. And the path that we're kind of progressing is similar to what you saw with sales up over the last several years, which there are some key features that -- what we're looking for in sales of -- and custom objects was one of them.

            "name": "Kathryn Bueker",
            "content": "Thanks, Yamini. Let's turn to our third quarter financial results and our guidance for the fourth quarter and full year of 2021. Third quarter revenue grew 47% year-over-year in constant currency and 49% as reported. Q3 subscription revenue grew 49% year-over-year, while services and other revenue increased 39%, both on an as-reported basis.  The momentum we've seen over the last 1.5 years continued into the third quarter with broad strength across the business. We saw continued strength in revenue retention in Q3, trending nicely above our new target level of 110% with healthy customer dollar retention continuing to be a big driver of our overall strong retention performance.  Net revenue retention also continues to benefit from multiple upgrade drivers including strong cross-sell activity and seat expansions. Domestic revenue grew 41% year-over-year in Q3, while international revenue growth was 54% in constant currency and 58% as reported. While our international and domestic revenue growth rates in constant currency remained flat quarter-over-quarter, international revenue as a percentage of total revenue increased 3 points year-over-year to 46%.  We added 7,100 net customers in the quarter, growing our total customer count by 34% year-over-year to 128,000. Average subscription revenue per customer grew 9% year-over-year to $10,500 as we saw a continued positive mix shift towards our professional and enterprise tiers, along with strong installed base selling.  As we've discussed over the last couple of quarters, we expect these trends to continue into Q4 with net customer additions of about 7,000 and high single-digit year-over-year growth in ASRPC. Deferred revenue as of the end of September was $376 million, a 45% increase year-over-year.  Calculated billings was $353 million growing 45% year-over-year in constant currency and 43% as reported. Billings growth in Q3 was impacted by the strong installed base selling mix in the quarter, slightly lower billing duration and a more difficult comparison as a result of COVID-related customer plays in the year ago period.  The remainder of my comments will refer to non-GAAP measures. Third quarter gross margin was 80%, down 2 points year-over-year as a result of increased customer usage and the launch of our new EU data center. Subscription gross margin was 83%, while services gross margin was negative 9%.  Third quarter operating margin was 10%, up 2 points compared to the same period a year ago. At the end of the third quarter, we had nearly 5,500 employees, up 38% year-over-year. Net income in the third quarter was $26 million or $0.50 per fully diluted share.  CapEx, including capitalized software development costs, was $16 million or 5% of revenue in Q3. Free cash flow in the quarter was $38 million or 11% of revenue. We continue to expect CapEx as a percentage of revenue to be about 5% in 2021 and now expect free cash flow to be about $180 million for the full year. Finally, our cash and marketable securities totaled $1.3 billion at the end of September.  And with that, let's dive into guidance for the fourth quarter and full year of 2021. For the fourth quarter, total revenue is expected to be in the range of $356 million to $358 million, up 42% year-over-year at the midpoint. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be between $34 million and $36 million. Non-GAAP diluted net income per share is expected to be between $0.52 and $0.54. This assumes 50.9 million fully diluted shares outstanding.  And for the full year of 2021, total revenue is now expected to be in the range of $1.287 billion to $1.289 billion, up 46% year-over-year at the midpoint. Non-GAAP operating income is now expected to be between $113 million and $115 million. Non-GAAP diluted net income per share is now expected to be between $1.76 and $1.78. This assumes 50.7 million fully diluted shares outstanding.  As you adjust your models, keep in mind the following: At current spot rates, we expect FX to be a slight headwind to as reported revenue in Q4 and still expect a 3-point tailwind for the full year.  And with that, I'll hand things back over to Yamini for her closing remarks. Yes. Sure thing. I would just start by saying that we actually feel really good about delivering constant currency billings growth in the mid-40s, especially when you look at the sort of tougher comparison that we have here in Q3 relative to Q2, it's basically 12-or-so points more difficult.  Also what I did mention a few things that were headwinds to constant currency billings in the quarter. There's a little bit of a headwind from duration. And you may recall in my prepared remarks that I noted that this was a very strong installed base selling quarter that also has a little bit of a headwind as it relates to billings particularly around deferred revenue. FX on deferred is very tricky and you may recall, in particular that the euro weakened against the dollar pretty dramatically over the course of Q3.  And so the impact on deferred revenue from FX was much more acute. There is about a 4-point headwind to deferred revenue on a constant currency basis versus an as-reported basis [Technical Difficulty]. Yes. Thanks for the question. I think the good news is that our KPIs of customer additions and ASRPC kind of came in exactly where we told you that they were going to. We did see that nice pickup in ASRPC, really in that high single-digit range.  And again, that positive momentum in ASRPC is a mix-driven calculation. The customer mix is moving towards that Pro and Enterprise. And we, again, I'll highlight the strong installed base selling commentary for Q3. And both of those things are, like, key drivers of ASRPC growth. Yes. I think I talked a little bit about the Analyst Day when we tried to highlight the strategic pillar around segmentation. Internally, we look at what we call large deals as anything that is greater than $3,000 MRR. And we've seen that the volume of those deals increased 81% year-over-year. Yes. I mean I think I'll stick to Q3, but you're exactly right and have a great memory. We made a decision to give the organization a break at the very beginning of the quarter, and we had a global decompress for all of our employees. And that obviously creates a bit of a slow start to the quarter. We feel great about where we landed for the full quarter, but we definitely saw momentum in the second couple of months as a result of that, I would say, well-deserved break on behalf of our employees. Yes. Thanks, Yamini. So if I just take a step back and look at the specific customer segment that Yamini outlined in the U.S.-based customers with 100 or less employees in that sort of B2B software and services space, as Yamini said we think that's a tens-of-billions-of-dollars-of-GMV market for us. And that would translate into something that looks more like hundreds of millions of potential payment volume for us over the next couple of years.  And as I covered at the Analyst Day, HubSpot's going to earn a transaction fee on this payment volume. And the amount of that transaction fee is going to depend on the payment method. It's going to depend on the transaction size, and we will recognize that fee as revenue to HubSpot. There'll be an associated cost with that transaction, most notably for credit card transaction that's it, that interchange fee. And so the gross margin for the payments business is going to be a much different and lower gross margin than what were used on the software side.  That said, the sales expense in growing the business is also going to be very different than the core software business, and we feel really good about the overall margin for HubSpot over time with respect to payments.  We will likely, in the near term, record any revenue under that what we call services and other revenue stream. And as we ramp up over time, we will have to evaluate when it is the appropriate time to break that revenue out. Yes. So the FX headwind to billings overall was, net, was 2% headwind, right? And that's a combination, as you are indicating of a tailwind to revenue with a more extreme headwind to the deferred revenue component of billings. In terms of the relative impact of duration versus FX, I think it's a combination of duration and the fact that, that we have a higher mix of installed base selling that sort of make up the other part of the difference between constant currency revenue and constant currency billings. Yes. Thanks for the question. I think that you are right at Analyst Day, we shared a new target level for net revenue retention at or above 110%. And what we talked about was a couple of different drivers. The first of those drivers was really strong customer dollar retention. That's what we call it internally; may refer to it as gross retention.  And what we said is about half of the impact on total net revenue retention was associated with improvements on customer dollar retention. The other piece of that is that our upgrades are improving, and we have a diverse set of upgrade drivers that are helping to increase net revenue retention that sort of second half, those drivers will also help drive ASRPC growth, right? So it's not that retention is driving. It's the same core adoption of a greater portion of the platform that is driving both the net revenue retention and higher ASRPC. Yes. I guess the way that I would think about it is -- and we tried to talk a bit about this at the Analyst Day was how we balance growth and profitability. And overall, if you just sort of at the highest level, think about it, what we have been trying to do and what we continue to try to do is focus on building really durable long-term growth for the company. And we will clearly look for ways on a regular basis to expand margins. And we leverage our long-term financial framework to try to do that.  What we don't want to do is forgo really high conviction, really high return opportunities to drive future growth so that we can deliver very specific leverage targets from one year to the next. And so you heard us talk about it at the Analyst Day you hear Yamini talk about it. Now we feel really good about the opportunity in front of us, and we want to make sure that we continue to invest into that opportunity.  And so the areas where you're going to see us invest in 2022 are going to be the same areas where you've been seeing us invest over the last couple of years. In particular, we want to make sure that we are leaning into our R&D organization to drive innovation because we think that's the engine for strong and durable growth. So I don't have specific puts and takes in 2022 but what I would tell you is we're going to continue to invest in the places where we have been seeing strong ROI, and we believe that we can continue to see strong ROI and that's primarily in the innovation of the product. So Parker, thanks a lot for the question. Broadly speaking, that's right. I think -- but if you kind of break it down between our segments, partners focus much more on upmarket for all the obvious reasons. More customer -- more integration, more CRM implementations, more customization. And so it's weighted a little bit higher towards the upmarket segment.  And look, our strategy has been very, very clear in terms of working with our Solution Partner ecosystem. If you historically look at the Solution Partner ecosystem, it's about 4,000 strong. They were marketing agencies, but we have done a lot of investments to diversify that Solution Partner ecosystem, and we're very pleased with the level of expertise in helping our upmarket customers.  It's one of those competitive moats for us. They do a fantastic job of understanding our customers as well as our products. And when partners get engaged, we see high customer dollar retention as well as revenue retention. And we understand that, we had an event right after INBOUND for partners where we talked about our strategy and doubling down in our strategy of selling and servicing with them, and we're making pretty hefty investments in enabling partners, matching partners with customers and building expertise within the solution partner base. And so we're excited to see that ecosystem thrive. Yes. Thanks for the question. I think what we have shared, Arjun, is that we feel like the trends that we saw in Q2 and in Q3 are going to continue into Q4. In terms of longer term, these are not metrics that we manage the business against. And you heard Yamini talk about the segmentation strategy where we intend to innovate both at that upmarket, but also with the Velocity segment that is more lower end. And as we innovate at one end or another year to continue to see movement in both of those KPIs.  So I think it's fair to say that in the short term. But over the longer term, we're going to continue to see a little bit more volatility."

            "content": "Thanks, Chuck, and greetings, everyone. Thank you for joining us today as we review HubSpot's third quarter 2021 results. I hope you were all able to join us a few weeks ago for our Annual Analyst Day at INBOUND. We covered a lot of ground as part of those sessions.  So today, what I want to do is to focus on the great results in Q3 as well as the strategic pillars guiding us on our path to becoming the #1 CRM platform for scaling companies.  Let's kick things off with a look at our Q3 results. We're continuing to see strong performance across the business, with revenue growth of 47% in constant currency year-over-year, and total customers growing 34% year-over-year to more than 128,000. As we've seen over the past year, small and medium businesses continue to embrace our modern CRM to connect with their customers, drive insights from customer interactions and transform their businesses for the digital age.  Our strong results speak to the fact that HubSpot is providing the right foundation for these companies to scale. At our Analyst Day, I provided an overview of our long-term growth strategy and introduced the 4 strategic pillars guiding our investments.  So today, I'd like to share how our recent product announcements at INBOUND are helping us make meaningful progress towards our long-term goals. Our first strategic pillar is to deliver a world-class front-office platform by investing in new and existing hubs as well as driving the extensibility of our platform.  We're always looking for ways to address the evolving needs of our customers and expand our addressable market. We'll continue to explore the development of new hubs, invest in anchor hubs like marketing and sales and accelerate innovation around emerging hubs like Operations Hub.  Earlier this week, we officially launched Operations Hub Enterprise. This is a great example of how we are accelerating innovation in emerging hubs. As you all know, we first launched Operations Hub Starter and Professional earlier this year to help customers get all of their data into HubSpot and build more advanced automated workflows.  Now with Operations Hub Enterprise, our customers are able to report on that data in more connected and consistent ways to generate insights to drive growth. We also announced important improvements to Service Hub, including custom surveys and a new customer portal that's currently in public beta.  We'll continue to invest so that our individual hubs are powerful and easy to use. But we also know that much of HubSpot's magic comes from how our hubs seamlessly work together. And with more than half of our customers adopting multiple hubs, we know that more and more companies are realizing the unique advantage that comes from managing their entire front office in 1 platform.  A great example of this multi-hub approach in action is Triage, a staffing agency that arranges assignments for traveling nurses across the U.S. After connecting its back-office systems to our platform and implementing our marketing, sales, CMS and Operations Hub, Triage has seen increased efficiency and performance across the company. Their e-mail click-through rate doubled, their sales team's capacity grew by 60% and they are now able to quickly mobilize for flu or COVID vaccinations. There is still plenty of runway left when it comes to going broad and deep with our hubs and platforms. I'm really excited to see where the needs of our customers will take us next.  Our second strategic pillar is to strengthen our segmentation approach across product and go to market and this is driving product innovation at HubSpot in 2 key ways. First, we're bringing high-end features that have traditionally only been available to large enterprises down to our small and mid-market customers. And second, we're bringing a human-friendly product and purchasing experience traditionally seen in small and mid-market businesses up to large enterprises.  At INBOUND this year, we focused on the latter half of the strategy, announcing new, powerful and easy-to-use features that add tremendous value to our enterprise tier. In addition to new plant-wide governance features like permission sets and audit logging, we also launched SAM DOCSIS, a feature that enables customers to test changes to their portal without impacting their primary account.  In Marketing Hub Enterprise, we introduced Business Units, a new feature that enables customers to manage multiple brands to ensure a more consistent and targeted experience for their audiences. And new enterprise level forecasting tools in Sales Hub and Service Hub help managers keep track of their team's progress towards their goals. All of these enhancements help our larger customers customize their usage of HubSpot without adding complexity as they continue to grow.  We're seeing success in our segmentation approach. On the high end, we are consistently closing more large deals and have seen an 81% year-over-year increase in Q3 large deals.  Our Starter addition is also fueling customer acquisitions. That segment has grown from a small percentage of our customer base a few years ago to more than 50% of our total customers as of Q3.  Now let's turn to our third pillar, investing in commerce and payments. As I discussed during our Analyst Day, commerce has traditionally been thought of as an extension of the back office. It was sold to finance leaders, it was about collecting revenue and driving cost efficiencies. But commerce as a part of CRM is fundamentally different and it's about enabling growth, not saving money.  We're excited about the long-term opportunity for an integrated payment solution. That said, we're still in very early stages of this opportunity, and there are years of runway for growth. For now, we're focused on reaching U.S.-based B2B companies with fewer than 100 employees so that we can deliver a strong product to market fit before expanding internationally.  Having the product market fit in 1 geography ensures that we -- when we go international, we're able to capture a significant portion of GMV of any country we enter. And while it's only been available for about a month, we have seen nice momentum with our open beta as customers tap into the ability to quickly and easily start taking payments.  One early adopter is ZenPilot, an operations consulting business that needed to scale operations but was being held back by a labor-intensive payment system. ZenPilot's previous system could only process credit card transactions and required manual work to process payments via ACH.  With HubSpot Payments, ZenPilot is able to accept ACH payments with ease. The sales team is able to focus more on lead generation activities and therefore, have increased leads by 30%.  The early feedback from customers like ZenPilot is evidence that we are on the right path in enabling our B2B customers to deliver a consumer-grade buying experience. I'm very excited about what the future holds for HubSpot payments in the long term.  Our fourth and final pillar is to continue to scale HubSpot. As you've heard Brian and Dharmesh say before, we want to build a company that future generations can be proud of. As part of that vision, we're investing in hiring and growing diverse talent, working on our environmental initiatives, and doubling down on protecting our customers' data and scaling our systems to meet their needs.  By investing in these 4 pillars, we're building a strong foundation that will serve both HubSpot and our customers as we chart our next phase of growth. I'm incredibly excited about our long-term opportunity, and I'm very confident that we have the right strategy, the right investments and the right team in place to help us execute and win.  With that, I'll turn it over to Kate to give an overview of our fantastic financial results. Kate? Alex, thanks a lot for the question. We are seeing the same headlines that you mentioned in terms of supply chain challenges, macro environment. But I'll say that there's not a set of factors that have outsized exposure to here at HubSpot. In terms of the demand environment and the demand patterns, it's really solid.  And if I step back and look at why we feel very good about the demand environment, it's 2 things. One, the world has changed. Since the start of the pandemic, customers have looked for digital solutions and the buyer expectations have changed pretty significantly where they need a consumer-like buying experiences. They want to be able to connect to their customers digitally and they want to be able to grow and accelerate growth in this environment.  And two, we have the perfect solution for that. HubSpot has a very unique value proposition. We have crafted the solution and we provide consumer-like user experience with enterprise-grade features, and that is resonating really well in terms of the market. So I feel very good about the demand environment and what we are seeing in the pipeline.  And this reflects both across our North America business as well as international business. So feeling pretty good. Yes. Great question, Mark. So at the Analyst Day, what I said was that in terms of, there are 2 ways that companies typically sell. One is the touchless sale and then the other is the rep-assisted sale. Now in terms of cashless sales, B2B companies haven't just gotten started in terms of online processing of services and software. And our hypothesis is that we can really help them and enable new revenue streams for a company.  Now in the prepared remarks, I mentioned an example of a company, ZenPilot. They are in the consulting business. They wanted to start processing and that's an example of a touchless sales -- In terms of the open beta, that's also where we are seeing interest, Mark. We're seeing companies that are in services that are thinking about new online revenue streams that haven't done it before, and this is an easy and seamless way for them to grow. It's pretty early days. It's -- we've been in open beta just for a few weeks here now, but we're definitely seeing interest in terms of opening new revenue streams. So we'll keep watching. Thank you, Samad. That's really like my favorite question about payments because the way we think about payments, commerce is part of -- CRM is fundamentally different. It is about enabling revenue growth for our customers. And it's very, very different from commerce as part of back office, where traditionally, it is about talking to the finance leader and focusing on collecting revenues and cost efficiency.  And over the past few quarters, as we have gone back to our customers and asked them how we can enable growth, it became really clear that we needed to embed commerce and payments as part of CRM. And there are 3 ways in which we can drive that growth.  The first one is what I just talked about with Mark's question, which is enabling new revenue team. So if you think about touchless, this is not where B2B companies have traditionally focused, and so we want to enable new revenue streams and provide opportunities for growth there.  The second area for growth is really helping with the rep assisted last-mile sale. So what I mean by that is HubSpot historically, we have focused on rep-assisted sales. But the last mile, which is core to cash has been the hardest nut to crack. And we want to focus on that. We want to streamline, simplify it so that the reps can now focus on growth initiatives on demand-generation activities. And so we do that right, we're going to actually enable growth for our customers.  And then the third thing which I'm super excited about is commerce brings context to every customer interaction. If you can imagine, having a commerce object deeply embedded within CRM, you now have more information when you run marketing campaigns. You can run marketing campaigns on abandoned cart. You have much more information in terms of sales interactions because you know where the invoice stands. You have much better service interactions because it's prioritized by the purchase history. So commerce deeply embedded CRM is just really valuable in terms of enabling growth. And so I think we're taking a very different approach and enabling growth for our customers. So I'm excited about the longer-term opportunity here. Stan, thanks for the question. I'm going to maybe address this from a broad strategic perspective and then I'll have Kate to address it in terms of how we'll be tracking it. As you heard us talk about at the Analyst Day, this is a long-term opportunity that we are very, very excited about.  And specifically, we have a targeted approach. The target market that we're going after U.S. companies with 100 employees or less that are B2B, mostly focused on services and software. The reason we are focused on that market is, first, it allows us to build a delightful product experience that customers can love.  And even within that market, we see it as a pretty large market, tens of billions in GMV within that segment. And we want to start with that market. And we're going to make sure that in terms of both the payment features as well as commerce features, we are focused delivering and driving market adoption and I think longer term, there is a significant opportunity for us to grow both upmarket domestically as well as international. And I'll pass it to Kate so she can address your question on how we will track and share our results. Brad, thanks for the question. I'd say that we see 3 things that happen across our customer base. The first is, what you said, which is more multi-hub. And you can see that reflected in the numbers that Kate shared at the Analyst Day. And so we definitely see the multi-hub customers land.  We're seeing still really good front doors with marketing, sales hubs. Each of those hubs have gotten really good over the past 12 to 18 months. And so they are very good front doors. And so we see that land-and-expand motion.  And then as you know, we launched the CRM suite, both at the starter level as well as the go level and those are also really good front doors. And so across the board, we are seeing all 3 motions.  Now I will say in terms of multi-hub, when our customers adopt multi-hub, the value that they get because it's a seamless user interface because it's a single data model because there is a single view of the customer. It's just much higher.  We see when customers adopt Sales Hub plus Marketing Hubs, they get much more leased when they just had Marketing Hub or sales sub loans, the same powerful combination with Marketing Hub and CMS Hub or Sales Hub and Service Hub.  And so I think what you're seeing is that there are great front doors into adoption. There is also a growing trend towards multi-hub as well as suite adoption. The combination of all 3 are kind of what you see as results in terms of ASRPC growth. It's a good question, Brian. I think it's across the board, the levels of maturity within our customer base are quite different. So you have some customers that are pretty early, and this -- they've realized in the past couple of years that they need to be digital-first, digital-ready, and they are kind of putting their toe and starting with one hub and then expanding.  And then there are customers like the use case example that I gave in the prepared remarks of Triage where they realize that they need complete digital front office platform that is all in one in order for them to be able to accelerate their growth given all of what they're seeing.  And so it really depends on the maturity of the customers. And the one thing that I would say is that our approach has been resonating really well with customers. We've taken a very, very different approach to building and crafting our solutions, and it's unique. So customers don't have to cobble together a bunch of different applications within their tech stack. They can start with 1 or multi-hub or go all in, but the crafted way in which we approach building products and therefore, the value that our customers see in our full suite is really resonating within the market. I think like, yes, we are excited about payments that we're equally excited about the core business, I will say that. In terms of the longer-term payment opportunity, if we really step back, there is just a lot that we can do to help our customers grow.  And the way we are going to focus on this, and we've said this in a couple of different ways, is that, first of all, from a payments perspective, we're going to just embed this in almost every way. Embedded payments, which as the name suggests is embedding it informed in web pages in meeting requests and really, that will help us drive adoption. And so from a road map, you will see us drive payment adoption.  I think the second part of what I'm excited about in the road map is building that commerce context into CRM and vice versa. That's where we see significant value that we can deliver to our customers by making sure that the commerce context is there in every interaction, whether it's marketing or sales or service, and both of those are going to open up a huge opportunity for us, but also it's going to enable growth for our customers.  So that's how we think about the road map and longer-term opportunity in terms of payments. But I'll also point that -- as we've talked about, the core business is really strong, and the core business is growing really well, and we're continuing to invest in terms of all of our strategic pillars and focused on driving a world-class CRM platform. So it's kind of balanced across new opportunities as well as core business. Rishi, thanks for the question. I think it really goes back to our strategic pillar, which is strengthening our segmentation approach. So both at the Analyst Day as well as prepared remarks, we talked about the investments we are making to make sure that every one of our segments are optimized.  We have broadly key segments. You've heard us speak about this, 1 to 20 segments where we are investing in product-led growth. The 20 to 200 segment, which is our traditional sweet spot from both a product and go-to-market perspective and the upmarket segment, which is the 200 to 2,000 segment, where we're making a lot of investments. And as we've mentioned before, we are being very thoughtful and deliberate in making product as well as go-to-market investments.  Our clear view is that both of these need to be in complete lockstep in terms of execution. So the success that you're seeing with the upmarket is one, because of the product. We have worked on the product extensively, and we've talked about wanting to maintain a consumer-grade look and feel while investing in powerful features and that is beginning to work. And in terms of go-to-market, we have invested in sales enablement, partner enablement as well as brand marketing efforts.  And so the results of our segmentation strategy is what is reflected both in terms of customer dollar retention as well as revenue retention. And this is kind of what Kate mentioned earlier in her comments about revenue retention. Thank you so much, Ryan, for the question. Yes, the Operations Hub Enterprise was just launched this week. And as you all know, we launched Operations Hub Starter as well as Pro earlier this year in April. And that's actually an example of one of the hubs where we co-launched it with partners.  Our partner community has been just incredibly involved in terms of the beta program. They were incredibly involved in terms of identifying early use cases. And we co-launched Operations Hub. In fact, that launch event was probably the highest NPS partner event that we have had all year. And the feedback from partners in terms of Operations Hub has been very, very promising as well as positive.  Now the broader point in terms of how we are enabling go-to-market with partners upmarket. As we optimize our product investments as well as go-to-market investments, we've been working hand-in-hand with partners in driving expertise within the partner ecosystem to enable them to take more complex implementations and that's beginning to work. And I'm very pleased with how our direct teams partner teams have been working collaboratively this year. Yes, we've been very, very balanced in terms of both international growth as well as North America growth. And as you heard us talk about, international is about 46% of our revenue and consistently growing really well.  In terms of adoption trends, it's quite similar. In a lot of international markets, they are still a bit earlier in terms of digital transformation and adoption of digital products. But overall, for example, Operations Hub has done really well there. And going multi-hub with CMS and marketing has done quite well there. And so the trends are pretty consistent across both of the markets. That's a good question. Overall, INBOUND, the product announcements, very, very favorable positive feedback from customers. We had really good engagement both in terms of the breakouts as well as the spotlight sessions and the NPS for some of the sessions were better than even last year.  So overall, INBOUND landed really well. The engagement of our customers has been really good and feedback in terms of the announcements there, Operations Hub Enterprise, Sandbox, Business Units, the feedback for a lot of those features that we announced at INBOUND has been very, very positive. It's still early days. It's just been a couple of weeks since INBOUND. And so we'll likely see more momentum in Q4 based on the announcements at INBOUND. That's a good question. I think I broadly categorized our product announcements in 3 areas. The first one is Operations Hub Enterprise that we just launched in November, really positive feedback. We've seen very good momentum not just for the Enterprise product, but also for the Pro as well as Starter releases earlier this year.  So we're seeing consistent good feedback there. I think the second class is just a lot of the upmarket-related big powerhouse features that we launched, right? So you heard us talk about Business Units, which, again, is another domino feature within Marketing Hub Enterprise. You heard us talk about Sandboxes and forecasting, which is pretty big in terms of sales.  So a lot of customers that have been looking or will need this in the future are excited about that category of features. And then Payments. Payments is early days, but a lot of customers are engaged in conversations in terms of how they can we had new revenue streams and as well as enable consumer-like buying experiences. And so those 3, I would say, are probably the big categories of interactions with customers. Thank you so much. It was great seeing a lot of you at INBOUND and do great work in Q4. We'll see you in the new year."

Now it\u2019s my pleasure to turn over the call to HubSpot\u2019s Chief Customer Officer, soon to be Chief Executive Officer, Yamini Rangan. Yamini?\nYamini Rangan: Thanks, Chuck and greetings, everyone. Thank you for joining us today as we review HubSpot\u2019s second quarter 2021 earnings results. I know you\u2019ve likely seen the exciting news that Brian will be taking on the role of Executive Chairman as of September 7th. We\u2019re all looking forward to having Brian back in action and stronger than ever when he returns next month. Brian will be joining the call here in a few minutes to talk about the path forward in this new capacity, as well as to share some reflections on the 15 years that have led us to today\u2019s news and this quarter fantastic results. Before we do that, I want to focus on the business at hand, the great results from last quarter. We continue to operate from a broad position of strength with Q2 revenue growth accelerating to 47% year-over-year in constant currency and total customers growing 40% year-over-year to over 121,000. We\u2019ve seen multi-product adoption growth to over half of our total customers. A great indicator that more companies are realizing the advantage of managing their entire front office on one platform, with one data model, one view of their customers and one user interface that\u2019s easy to use. A key driver of this continued growth is digital transformation we\u2019re seeing as more companies have had to adapt to doing business online. This shift towards digitally powered customer experiences is one that HubSpot has been evangelizing for the past 15 years. So we\u2019ve been about the vision to meet the moment. As consumers increasingly expect remarkable digital experiences at each step of their journey, scaling companies need a powerful CRM platform to tie it all together. This makes CRM not just a nice to have solution, but an indispensable driver of long-term growth for our customers. A key part of that digital experience is the company website. This is a digital front door. Traditional website content management systems are often siloed from other essential front office functions. They\u2019re complex to manage, they lack speed, security and scalability that companies need to grow their business. That\u2019s why we launched CMS Hub Professional and Enterprise last year and we are continuing to invest in the platform with CMS Hub Starter launched yesterday. CMS Hub Starter is built as part of our CRM platform to give companies seamless access to all of their customer data. Having a CRM powered website enables both marketers and developers to efficiently work together to build remarkable digital experiences and maximize the revenue generating opportunity. As part of that launch, we also adjusted the pricing of our CMS Hub Professional and Enterprise tiers to reflect the increased value we are delivering to our customers through SEO enhancement, dynamic pages, site trees and increased limits and capacity with even more advanced features in the roadmap. We\u2019re still in early stages of this launch, but we are confident that CMS Hub Starter was still a painful gap for marketers and developers that are looking to spend less time managing their system and more time driving growth. Another important function of digital first transformation is revenue operations. Last quarter, I talked about the launch of Operations Hub, a new product designed to transform the role of operations professionals and empower them to become strategic drivers of revenue and growth. I\u2019m excited to share that we are continuing to hear positive feedback from customers and partners and that\u2019s Operations Hub has performed nicely ahead of our internal growth expectations over the past quarter and a half. Data Sync, our robust new integration engine has quickly become one of the most compelling and popular free tools, particularly amongst small customers, exemplifying how Operations Hub will drive adoption of our CRM platform. We\u2019re also seeing strong adoption of programmable automation among the larger companies who are looking to take full advantage of their data and deliver personalized experiences to their customers. One of our top solutions partners had this to say about the feature. Programmable automation makes HubSpot significantly more flexible. We\u2019ve used it to build even the most advanced business processes in HubSpot from ERP integrations to data enrichment, commission, calculations to renewal communications. With programmable automation in Operations Hub, if you can dream it, you can automate it. Thanks to the team at Aptitude 8 for sharing the feedback. We\u2019re so glad that they\u2019re seeing value in Operations Hub. Both Operations Hub and CMS Hub Starter are great examples of our commitment to crafting our CRM platform in-house rather than coddling it together through clunky acquisitions, that\u2019s focused on delivering a consumer grade UI matched with a scalable enterprise backend sets us apart from traditional CRM platforms and puts HubSpot in a strong position to achieve our goal of becoming the number one CRM platform for scaling companies. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Kate to give an overview of our fantastic financial results.\nKate Bueker: Thanks, Yamini. Let\u2019s turn to our second quarter financial results and our guidance for the third quarter and full year of 2021. Second quarter revenue grew 47% year-over-year in constant currency and 53% as reported. Q2 subscription revenue grew 53% year-over-year, while services and other revenue increased 44%, both on an as reported basis. We continued to see strong performance across all of our hubs, tiers and geographies in Q2. Revenue retention continued to be very strong in the quarter, once again benefiting from healthy customer dollar retention levels. In addition, our net revenue retention continued to benefit from a diverse set of upgrade drivers with particular strengths from addition upgrades, cross sell activity and seat expansions. As of Q2, 58% of our customers are getting value out of two or more hubs as they adopt HubSpot as a platform. Domestic revenue grew 42% in Q2, while international revenue growth was 54% year-over-year in constant currency and 68% as reported. International revenue represented 46% of total revenue in Q2, up four points year-over-year. We added over 7,100 net customers in the quarter bringing our total customer count to 121,000, up 40% year-over-year. Average subscription revenue per customer grew 8% year-over-year to approximately $10,200. As we saw a positive mix shift toward our professional and enterprise tiers, coupled with strong install base selling in the quarter. We expect our strong install base selling and positive product mix shift to continue through the second half of 2021. As a result, we anticipate second half net customer additions to sustain around these levels, as we continue to compare against the robust Starter Growth Suite customer additions from 2020. And we expect high single digits year-over-year growth in ASRPC in Q3 and Q4. Deferred revenue, as of the end of June, was $362 million, a 50% increase year-over-year. Calculated billing was $334 million growing 60% year-over-year in constant currency and 65% as reported. This acceleration in constant currency billings growth was driven by strong business performance in the quarter, in addition to an easier overall comparison as a result of the challenging business environment in the second quarter of 2020. The remainder of my comments will refer to non-GAAP measures. Second quarter gross margin was 81%, down a little over one point year-over-year. Subscription gross margin was 84%, while services\u2019 gross margin was negative 5%. Second quarter operating margin was 9% relatively flat as compared to the same period a year ago. Operating margin in the quarter exceeded our expectations primarily as a result of our strong revenue performance. At the end of the second quarter, we had just under 5,000 employees, up 32% year-over-year. Net income in the second quarter was $22 million or $0.43 for fully diluted share. CapEx including capitalized software development costs was $16 million or 5% of revenue in Q2. Free cash flow in the quarter was $26 million or 8% of revenue. We continue to expect CapEx as a percentage of revenue to be about 5% in 2021 and now expect free cash flow to be between $170 million and $175 million with a seasonally strong free cash flow quarter in Q4. Finally, our cash and marketable securities totaled $1.3 billion at the end of June. And with that, let's dive into guidance for the third quarter and full year of 2021. For the third quarter, total revenue is expected to be in the range of $325 million to $327 million, up 43% year-over-year at the midpoint. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be between $27 million and $29 million. Non-GAAP diluted net income per share is expected to be between $0.42 and $0.44. This assumes 50.6 million fully diluted shares outstanding. And for the full year of 2021, total revenue is now expected to be in the range of $1.268 billion to $1.272 billion, up 44% year-over-year at the midpoint. Non-GAAP operating income is now expected to be between $107 million and $109 million. Non-GAAP diluted net income per share is now expected to be between $1.67 and $1.69. This assumes 50.5 million fully diluted shares outstanding. As you adjust your models, keep in mind the following. At current spot rates, we're forecasting an FX tailwind to as reported revenue of two points in Q3, a neutral impact to Q4 and a three point tailwind for the full year. Lastly, I look forward to seeing many of you again for our virtual analyst day as part of our inbound 2021 event on October 12. And with that, I'll hand things over to Brian for some closing thoughts.\nBrian Halligan: Thanks, Kate. It's a true pleasure to be able to speak with all of you, again. I'm so proud of the entire HubSpot team. They've been absolutely cranking during my time away. And I'm so thankful for the work that Yamani, Dharmesh, Kate and the rest of the leadership team have done in my absence. My sincere thanks to all of you. I also want to say a huge thank you to all of you for the well-wishes over the past couple of months. The road to recovery has been a long one, but I'm feeling really, really good. My head is 100% back, my body well that needs a little more physical therapy, but I'm making great progress to get back to 100% quite soon. Now, back in June, we celebrate our 15 year anniversary of HubSpot's founding. When I look back at the last 15 years, I'm super proud of what we've been able to accomplish. We built a truly mission driven organization designed to solve for the customer. It actually helped millions of organizations grow better. This past year, we've hit some exciting milestones like passing a $1 billion in ARR and 100,000 customers. These are just the start, HubSpot still in the very early innings and have the lot more value to provide to our customers, partners and employees. One of the keys to the modern success we've had so far is, we haven't been afraid to take inspiration from the Warren Buffett quote that goes something like, someone's sitting in the shade today because someone planted a seed several years ago. That's HubSpot in a nutshell. We've been willing to plan seeds like shifting from a marketing app to a front office suite, shifting from our front office suite to a front office platform, shifting to a premium model and many, many others that are all paying up quite nice before. Today, lots of shade going on. Now over the last six months, I've been thinking a lot about how I can have the most impact on HubSpot moving forward, and moving to the Executive Chairman role feels like a natural fit. As an Executive Member of the Board, I'll be able to lean into the things that excite me like planting and nurturing more of the seeds that will turn into being shady trees for years to come. My transition to Executive Chairman would not be possible, if we weren't super confident in Yamani\u2019s ability to lead HubSpot. When we hired Yamani we knew we\u2019re getting an incredible leader with an amazing track record of holding high-impact roles at SAP, Workday and Dropbox will be able to align marketing sales and service teams and create a more cohesive experience for our customers. But what we've actually gotten is so much more than that since the day Yamani arrived, she's made HubSpot better from reducing friction for our customers to leading the company with clarity and empathy through the pandemic. Yamani has proven she's ready to take on the role of CEO to help both HubSpot and our customers and partners grow better. And she's just the perfect complement to Dharmesh and me to write the next chapter. I want to close out by once again, thanking Yamani for her terrific leadership over the past six months and offering my congratulations to her on this exciting milestone, Dharmesh and I have no doubt that she's the right person to lead HubSpot moving forward. And I'm super excited about the journey ahead. I want to thank all of you for your time. Now, speaking of Yamani, over to you.\nYamini Rangan: Thank you so much, Brian, for your kind words and for your incredible support during my time here at HubSpot. I'm deeply humbled, grateful, and super excited to take on this new role in partnership with you, Dharmesh and the entire HubSpot team. It was your visionary leadership as founders that got us here today. And that leadership will continue to be invaluable, as HubSpot grows. I'm excited to continue working together to build innovative products for our customers who use a remarkable culture for our employees and ultimately make HubSpot the number one CRM platform for scaling company. Operator, please open up the call for some questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Samad Samana from Jefferies. Your line is open.\nSamad Samana: Good evening. Welcome back, Brian. 2Q really representing spades, the great company Dharmesh have built all these years. And Yamini\u2019s strong leadership steering at recently, congrats on the move to Executive Chairman really happy, you're staying and Yamani congrats on your move to CEO full time. I'd love to hear from both of you a little bit more about how you two will be dividing up the core responsibility as going forward? And where each of you will be focusing your individual attention? And then Yamini, maybe for you, it's obviously early, but you've been at the hell map for six months. It would be great to hear. Maybe if you could give us some thoughts about HubSpot's vision and strategy going forward.\nBrian Halligan: Samad, I will kick it off and hand it to Yamini. But it is great to hear your voice, my friend, thank you very much for asking the first question here. I'll say I feel fantastic. My head is fully recovered from my accident and thrilled to be back in HubSpot in this room with my friends and colleagues is just a terrific time for me. Now, when I get hurt, I had a lot of time on my hands, spend a lot of time in a hospital bed, looking at the ceiling, and I was thinking about, what can I do? How can I add value to HubSpot in a bigger way going forward? I've been beneath 15 years, what's next for me? And I thought, this is a good time. I'm going to become an Executive Chairman and Yamini is going to become CEO, and it's going to be a one plus one equals three combination. Yamini, we hired \u2013 I hired Yamani. She is the perfect fit for this job and for this space of growth to take us to the next level. She's just the perfect fit. She's at my job for the last six months. You guys see the numbers are fantastic. She done a masterful job. I'm very, very, very bullish on her. In terms of dividing up what we're going to work on, we've talked a lot about that. Now, I will let Yamini weigh in on her side. What I'm sort of focused on as Executive Chair is first and foremost, I plan to the Executive Chair active and engaged Executive Chair. And you've probably heard me tells a bad joke that I used to say on these calls that if I ever leave pumps out, they're going have to take me out on a stretcher or a straight jacket. You might have to ask those deals at adolescence, but my main role is to help Yamini, do as best as she can and keep the thing rolling. I do feel like at the very early innings of HubSpot. The second thing is I've always enjoyed doing and help drive is place seed to turn into big shady trees that we've all enjoyed over the years. The app to sweet tree, we planted several years ago, it's still the small tree. There's a lot more growth to go on the suite. We're just now planning the suite to platform fee. That's going to kind of go really well. It's top of the first ending on that tree, this put the premium model, like the culture, these are seeds we planted long, long \u2013 a long, long time ago that have all paid off. And I like that type of work and I like products and product vision. So that's kind of where I'm going to be focused and then just helping Yamini. How about you, Yamini?\nYamini Rangan: Well, thank you, Brian. And I have I'm so humbled, grateful, and super excited to take this new role and write the next chapter of growth at HubSpot. It's not \u2013 I would say, I'm particularly excited because I get to work with two brilliant people Brian and Dharmesh, who've done this for 15 years who have fantastic experience. The three of us share a lot in common of growth mindset, just curiosity, focus on product innovation, focus on customer centricity and I think the combination of their experience, plus my focus on scaling customers is going to be powerful. You asked the question about the vision and strategy. Our vision is clear. Our vision is to help millions of organizations grow better, and we're just getting started in accomplishing that vision. And for strategy, over the last six months or the last couple of years it's been working, it's clear and it's not changing. And if I had to articulate the strategy, it's threefold. First off, we want to build a best-in-class CRM platform for scaling companies. And we'll do this by expanding to new hubs like you saw us do with operations sub last quarter, and we'll do this by investing heavily into our existing of hubs you've heard about the CMS hub this quarter. We have just a long way to go a lot more to do in terms of the product. The second part of our strategy is fueling all of our segments. Now we focus on the one to 2000 segment and historically they've been really good at the 20 to 200 and we have unparalleled product market fit there. We've been investing heavily in the lower end of the segment, one to 20, and we'll continue to invest in the 200 to 2000. So we have just a great enterprise class of products with consumer grade ease of use, and this is working. And finally, the third part of the strategy I'm very excited about is that we want to continue to build an organization that can scale. We care deeply about our employees. We care deeply about diversity, and we want HubSpot to be the place that's maybe the best place for people to work and serve our customers. So I am super excited to get started on this journey and write the next chapter of growth at HubSpot.\nSamad Samana: That's great. Thank you for that \u2013 both for that detailed answer. And Kate, I know the big news was the transition, but it wouldn't be a HubSpot quarter if I didn't ask on the financials, just that, that billings number was very, very strong. I know there's an easy comp there, but even if I look against the very strong 1Q. Maybe can you just help us unpack if there's anything that changed in terms of either duration or was just \u2013 were there more larger customers in the quarter that lean toward enterprise and took more seats than normal? Just help us understand the really good amount of strength there?\nKate Bueker: Yes. Sure things, Samad. [Technical Difficulty] Q2 \u2013 there's not much out of the ordinary here. There's not a lot of big changes in duration. The biggest driver of the billings performance was the strong bookings growth that we had in the quarter. The one thing that I would point out and you kind of got it in the question is that there is a relatively easier compare for billings relative to revenue in constant currency. You might remember last year in Q2, we ran a number of short term customer release plays that had a bit of a negative impact on our Q2 2020 billings. And so billings time is frankly, a little bit of an easier comp in revenue.\nSamad Samana: Great, thank you. Brian, we'll miss you on the call. But congrats again, and look forward to seeing yet future inbounds.\nBrian Halligan: Yes, I\u2019ll see you actually pretty soon. I'll be in the investor day at the in inbound. So we will see you soon.\nOperator: And our next question is Mark Murphy from JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nMark Murphy: Yes. Thank you very much, Brian, as much as I enjoy reading your tweets, it's so much better to hear your voice. So great to hear from you and congrats to both of you on all these tremendous milestones. Yamani, let me start with this. I think you talked in the past about bringing high-end features down to mid-market companies. I'm just wondering which features maybe have driven the greatest traction recently in some of the enterprise additions, whether it be custom objects or account-based marketing or different channels that are emerging. Just anything else that you see, which might be resonating in the results here?\nYamini Rangan: Yes. Thanks a lot, Mark. Good to hear your voice and appreciate your wish for both Brian and myself. I say that enterprise, all of the product investments that we have making an enterprises working. Our strategy is really to build products that fit every one of our segments and our up market segments from 200 to 2000, that's been a focus area for us now last year we powered up marketing pop and the lot of the features that we announced at the beginning of the year deeply resonated with our customers. And as inbound, we launched sales hub enterprise, as you know, and custom objects, huge hit a lot of the CPQ advanced features that we added huge hit. In Q1 of this year, we added conversation intelligence. Now it\u2019s a category in and of itself, and the fact that we added it to power a hub and is now a seamless part of our whole suite that is resonating deeply within the market. So our strategy for continuing to build powerhouse features while maintaining the ease of use that is consumer grade things. That is what is working and broadly, if you look at the up market, we're just getting a fair share of a fast and growing market, and we'll continue to invest both on product as well as go to market to continue feeling that.\nDharmesh Shah: One thing that we've seen \u2013 we talked about custom objects, which has been really well received, we're continuing to pull on that thread. So we have custom objects, but for the data associations, things that customers have been asking for, and the idea there is for a company to be able to model this entire business within HubSpot. So the more flexible database gets, the more data we can hold there as a higher percentage of 200 to 2000 segments we can serve well.\nMark Murphy: Okay. Thank you for that. Appreciate the additional color. And Yamini, just another quick follow-up, it sounds like you're mostly focused on executing on the preexisting roadmap and strategy. You've been a big part of it. It's been performing amazing and well, I think, kind of falling on Samad\u2019s question, I'm just wondering, do you carry some unique philosophies or maybe just think the time is right to make any kinds of little tweaks for instance, the focus up market versus down market or the optimal number of hubs, right. [Technical Difficulty] conversation intelligence that are \u2013 how do you put this on the operations side any of those sectors where you have a little different view?\nYamini Rangan: That's a great question. I think it goes back to the earlier thoughts in terms of strategy. Our strategy is clear. We have a focus on having the best CRM suite in the market. That means we'll continue to invest in our existing hubs and we'll continue to make new investments in additional hubs. Then there's plenty of ideas. Mark, we just came from our annual strategy offsite in June and we have in our collective heads product innovation for the next 15 years. And the focus on horizon one, horizon two, horizon three bets have worked really well for the company. And my job is to work with Brian, Dharmesh to really empower that type of innovation going forward as we\u2019ve gotten. I also think that our focus in terms of all of the segments, we've fired off every portion of our segments. And the way I look at it is how do we continue to optimize where we are strong, which is the 20 to 200 segment, but how do we continue to optimize the product led motion at the bottom end, as well as the up market motion through the investments that we have. And so that will continue to be the focus and I'm super excited. I think we have the right leadership team in product. We have the right leadership team and execution focused team in the go-to-market and I'm really excited to work with all of them.\nMark Murphy: Excellent. Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question is from Brad Sills from Bank of America Securities. Your line is open.\nBrad Sills: Great. Thanks guys and congratulations Yamini and Brian on your new roles, well-deserved both and Brian, great to hear from you as well. Great to hear your voice again. One of the things that stuck out for me in the quarter was the ASP acceleration and a lot could be driving that obviously you're executing up market. You're seeing operations hub traction, it's scale with some of the early results there. My question is where is the incremental ASP growth coming from when you look across all the different levers that could be driving that just larger customers, more enterprise uptake and upsell, operations hub, multiple products, there's a lot in there. If you could just maybe even just stack rank what's been driving that acceleration in ASP? Thank you.\nYamini Rangan: Yes. Many uptick inside of it. I think that it's sort of interesting to see where we had a really strong quarter and that will tell you where you're seeing the real drivers of that ASP growth. The first thing I would say is our new business, our new additions were particularly strong in the professional and enterprise tiers, which tend to have a larger ASP. We had a really strong quarter selling into the install base, including a record quarter for nominal upgrade from starter into professional and enterprise tiers. And then, you also saw the fueling of the cross sell with the addition of the operations hub. And then I guess the final thing that I would highlight is just an expansion in the number of seats that we're seeing our professional and enterprise customers on the sales side.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Stan Zlotsky from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nStan Zlotsky: Perfect. Thank you so much guys and congratulations on the very exciting moves within the company and Brian, obviously, great to hear your voice back on these calls. Quick question from my end, you mentioned that the pricing changes that you guys manage some of the products. Could you walk through the spirit \u2013 timing of the pricing changes, why and what, and as far as the pricing changes, is it fair to say that the you're going to follow similar strategy as in the best of grandfathering existing customers on the pricing changes are mainly for new customers and then have a quick follow-up?\nYamini Rangan: Yes. Thanks a lot, Stan for the question. In general, our pricing philosophy is twofold, what you will see us do is continue to bring high value added features down to our premium and started here. And what does insure us is that we managed disruption within our install base versus allowing competitors to disrupt us. The second part of the strategy is that it also ensures that we keep innovating and adding new features to our higher tiers pro and enterprise. And so that's our broader pricing philosophy. It's worked really well for us. That's exactly what you saw do with CMS. As we have added more features to enterprise and parole, we feel pretty comfortable that we are delivering a lot more value to our customers and therefore \u2013 there's confidence in kind of increasing that price. And in terms of your second question on grandfathering, very similar to floor we'll first roll this out, this will impact all of the new customers and then over a period of time moves that problem.\nStan Zlotsky: Got it. Got it. That's very helpful. And then the follow-up on net revenue retention, I know you guys don't really \u2013 doesn't really give it every quarter, but just maybe qualitatively directionally. How did it do relative to the really outstanding results you guys put up in Q1?\nYamini Rangan: Yes, thanks. We saw another really strong quarter of both customer dollar retention and net revenue retention, the story that we would tell you about retention in Q2 is basically the same story that I told you that retention in Q1. It starts with that foundation of customer dollar retention, where we've seen like really healthy trends there since the back half of 2020. And then again, similar to last quarter, there were a real diversity in terms of the upsell motions that are really driving the positive net revenue retention.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Ken Wong from Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open.\nKen Wong: Great. Thanks for taking my question and that then kind of congrats across the board from me as well. Building on Stan's question, just on CMS hub, so just thinking about that kind of the new basic skew there is this intended to get the laggards over to adopt or should we view this as potentially a way to open the funnel into the HubSpot franchise using CMS?\nDharmesh Shah: That's a great question. Ken, thank you. So taking a step back, we think about CMS at and why we're in that business. So CMS has one of the things that make HubSpot unique. There are no other leading CRM platforms that have a legit content management system as part of their overall platform offering, if you ask that why is that, I think the reason is because it's really hard to build a CMS. It's different from everything else it's like picking up trombone, which is like, okay, well, it's kind of hard. You have to use that sliding thing to kind of find them there's no keys or anything like that. It's difficult. By the way, I always thought you think of an official musical term in case you're wondering, but the reason, but if you have a marching band, you need a trombone. That's what kind of complete the thing. And so you need it. If you want a full CRM platform, you need a CMS. And the reason is not just about putting a website up there. It's about making the website a window into the backend data, into the CRM itself and bringing the customer in it's about forging that connection. So we're really excited about it. In terms of why would we launch a starter here, it's basically exactly what you were alluding to. We think getting this kind of web experience up is the first step often in the digital journey that we want customers to take that first step correctly. So we want to bring as many people on the platform, even CMS starts using as we possibly can. And it kind of gets them onto the CRM platform from HubSpot and helps us kind of grow from there. So we're super excited about the opportunity to open.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Alex Zukin from Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nAlex Zukin: Thanks guys. Well, Brian, first great to have you back, sad to see you go. Yamini really excited to work with you. Maybe just the first question for you, Yamini, if you think about the \u2013 what you see in the pipeline and what you see in customer behaviors, as we look out to the second half and into a new post COVID world, can you kind of compare and contrast that with either what you saw in the first half and what you saw in the second half of last year for us?\nBrian Halligan: Okay, I'll start that. I actually not going anywhere, I'm going to be Executive Chairman and super active and hopefully for a long, long time, I'm going to be very active in HubSpot and helping guide strategy and partnering with Yamini and so. You're not getting rid of me that easily my friend.\nYamini Rangan: I would echo that Brian's like super active, always sounding us and always inspiring us. So that's pretty good. We're glad to have him back in full force. So Alex, question in terms of demand environment comparing first half and second half? Our demand environment is solid, similar to what we saw in the last quarter. Now, if you stepped back, our product is really unique relative to competition. I say we have a very, very strong value proposition that is resonating in the market. And Brian talked about sowing seeds. I think we've done enough product investments in the past few years and just seeing all of that payoff, we not only have that product market fit, but we also have a go to market fit. And the combination of those two are really helping us drive really strong financial results. In terms of pipeline, I'd say that the digital first and digital is ready. Both of those trends are here to stay. We're not going back from here. We are clearly seeing our customers modernizing their CRM platform from websites to marketing, to sales and service. They're all focused on delivering a connected customer experience and that's the kind of customer interest that you're seeing from a pipeline. And in July, at the very beginning of the quarter, we actually gave our entire global employee base a week of rest. And we did that, it was a very important choice. We care about culture. We care about employees. We wanted them to rest, recharge and come back with a full focus in second half. And that was the right thing to do. And I think I'm really feeling good about the second half and looking forward to \u2013 now what we're going to do in the second half.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Drew Foster from Citigroup. Your line is open.\nDrew Foster: Hey guys, thanks for taking the questions. Great to hear you're doing well, Brian and congrats, everyone else on their new roles. Given everything that's been said about kind of the importance of digital channels, not going away, can we get an update on where net logo retention stands today? And as you reflect over sort of a more protracted period, maybe two or three years, what are kind of the one or two things playing the biggest role there? Is it a greater share of customers using more products and just general stickiness the category more broadly rising in strategic importance? Maybe just give an update and touch on drivers there. Thanks.\nYamini Rangan: Yes. We'll probably talk in a lot more detail around retention in general at the upcoming analyst day, but I would give you maybe a couple of points to take away customer dollar retention, which is not the same as logo retention, but is sort of the baseline of how we think about it internally is very strong and show specific improvements through the back half of 2020 and sort of stayed at that new elevated level for the first and second quarter of this year, and I think it sounds kind of elementary, but the truth is that what we're seeing is that our customers are just using the products more. And as it turns out that leads to higher retention and we are as a result enjoying really healthy core retention levels.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Terry Tillman from Truist Securities. Your line is open.\nTerry Tillman: Thank you. And Brian and congrats and good luck on the next chapter, but I think one of the last questions, I think you said, you're going to stay on these calls going forward. So I'm going to \u2013 that's my base case. So we'll see you on the next fall. It's good to have you back and congrats Yamini as well. I guess, my question just relates to \u2013 it was echoed a couple of times in terms of installed base selling strength. I think it was mentioned by Yamini maybe and Kate, if I\u2019m not mistaking. What I\u2019m curious about is, has there been some things you\u2019ve done internally on a programmatic basis to kind of turn that dial more and/or investments? And is this more \u2013 should we see more of this in the future where there\u2019s more of a structural shift where you\u2019re just getting a lot more from the installed base selling each quarter? Thank you.\nYamini Rangan: Terry, thank you for the wishes, I really appreciate it. I think in terms of the install base, like our existing customers now have a lot more products that they can adopt, right? And in the past couple of quarters, we have introduced Operations Hub, we have improved the additions on a number of hubs, and so there\u2019s a lot more product for them to adopt. And I think that product has gotten much better. So when our customers are on one hub and then they see the value of a seamless single data model, single interface of other hubs that naturally pulls them in. So the product investments are probably the first ones that I\u2019ve talked about. I think the second part of it is that we certainly from a go-to-market perspective have invested more heavily in our customer success team, working more closely with our sales team, and that helps us connect the dots in terms of install base. And that\u2019s certainly been part of it. Now going forward, I\u2019d say, we want to have a balanced approach. We would \u2013 we continue to acquire a lot of new customers because of the strong value propositions that we deliver and we continue to sell into the install base. So you\u2019ll see a balance of both of these across our future quarters.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from DJ Hynes from Canaccord. Your line is open.\nDJ Hynes: Hey guys, congrats everyone on the new roles and the continued success with the team. Just a go-to-market question on Operations Hub. Is the buyer they\u2019re somebody that you\u2019re already talking to when you\u2019re selling marketing and sales, or is it somebody else in the organization that sits on top of those efforts? I\u2019m just trying to think about the ease of cross sell and whether in most cases it\u2019s with somebody you already know, and that\u2019s familiar with HubSpot?\nYamini Rangan: That\u2019s a great question, DJ. That\u2019s fantastic question. I will \u2013 let\u2019s say the buyer for Operations Hub is a revenue of persona. Now I spent a better part of the couple of decades in CRM running these operations teams and they\u2019re really the nerve centers of go-to-market functions. They\u2019re sometimes the unsung heroes, but they have a really critical role to play, which is providing the single source of truth about customers to the VP of sales and marketing, and the head of customer success. That\u2019s the persona and they\u2019ve always been involved in a CRM purchase and now we\u2019re providing them the flexibility and the power for them to deliver insights into the front office. And if you really step back on Operations Hubs, it\u2019s a couple of things. It really helps our customers connect their tech stack, it helps our customers clean up the data, it helps our customers automate the processes and these three challenges are traditionally the ones that revenue operations teams and all of our customers struggle with. And so it\u2019s really helping that critical persona be very, very successful. And we see a lot of traction. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we are seeing very positive feedback from our customers as well as partners and programmable automation has been on fire, really good traction. Clean use case of that is lead routing. You want to do advance lead routing, you are able to take all of the data from CRM, but also figure out the rep capacity, rep seniority, rep is on vacation, rep is on sabbatical and use all of that information to now be able to automate your processes. And so Operations Hub provides flexibility, automates processes and supercharges our CRM suite.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Brian Peterson from Raymond James. Your line is open.\nBrian Peterson: Thanks for taking the question. And Brian it\u2019s great to hear your voice and glad to hear your role, congrats you and Yamini in the new roles. So maybe just \u2013 maybe it\u2019s a higher level question for me, I\u2019m curious, if you were looking at the pace of net new customer ads, I\u2019m curious, how much does the platform in the breadth of functionality between different areas come up? I guess, I would think that post-COVID people are looking to maybe consolidate vendors and think about simplification of a digital go-to-market model. Is that something that\u2019s coming up in a lot more conversations and how do we think about that impacting win rates? Thank you.\nYamini Rangan: Yes. Brian, I will address that and then have maybe Kate or Dharmesh jump in. You\u2019re exactly right. Like if you think about our customers, they\u2019re coming through this whole pandemic thing, one, I need to digitize my entire front office and the starting point could be very different. The starting point could be a bunch of point solutions. It could be greenfield, they\u2019re using something like a spreadsheet, or they have a legacy system. And they\u2019re looking at providing an entire connected customer experience. And therefore, having an all in one solution resonates pretty deeply with them. And that\u2019s part of what they\u2019re enabling through the CRM suite. And we definitely see that motions beginning to happen. And I think we\u2019ll continue to invest in CRM suite. Now the CRM suite is like very powerful. One of the things that for us works is that when you get CRM suite in the hands of new customers or existing customers, they now see the power of the entire platform. There is higher product usage. Therefore, we get much better feedback on the product. Therefore, we can improve the product. And it\u2019s a nice little flywheel in terms of how we can drive the quality of our product even higher. And so there\u2019s a lot of goodness and certainly that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing in terms of trends from our customers.\nDharmesh Shah: Yes. One thing I\u2019ll add is that as you would expect to see 1000 companies, I want to make that digital transformation be digital first, but that kind of path to digital transformation is often paved with good intentions, but really terrible IT implementation, it\u2019s so complicated because they have all the database and multiple systems. So this kind of value proposition the HubSpot bring, which is we can simplify that, we can bring it all together into one operating system, one platform, one database, one experience, one company to call is a very compelling value proposition because most of these mid-market companies are dealing with that complexity as they scale and we help with that. It\u2019s resonating really well.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Parker Lane from Stifel. Your line is open.\nParker Lane: Yes. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. You did a tremendous job in the last few years of really making the platform applicable to customers of all sizes at the starter and enterprise additions of all your tools. I was just wondering if you could talk about the multi-product adoption across those different tiers. Is it mostly weighted towards the enterprise customers that are using multiple HubSpot products? Are you seeing a lot of traction as well to the point you\u2019re just making at the starter level, so as getting them into the door and attaching two new solutions around the initial lab? Thanks.\nKate Bueker: Yes. Maybe I\u2019ll start with some numbers and pass it on to Yamini for a little bit more color and context. We\u2019ve talked about this for a number of quarters, the growth in our multiproduct adoption, so customers who use two or more of our products has been on this sort of steady trajectory up for a number of years now. And not have happened across all of the tiers from the enterprise to the starter. We did see a bit of a step function in flection last spring when we introduced the Starter Growth Suite that really simple $50 price point, easy to buy. And so we see a lot of uptake at that starter level of just the full set of HubSpot products. As I shared in my prepared remarks, we\u2019re at 58% of our customers who are using more than one HubSpot product. And when you look at that new customers are probably 50-50 now adopting multiple HubSpot products.\nYamini Rangan: Yes. I think to add to the commentary that Kate provided. I think if you step back, we thought something really important having all of these products, which is we take a very crafted approach to CRM. It is not cobbled together through acquisitions. And if you step back and think about the single biggest challenge for customers, they\u2019re putting together very complex tech stacks and they\u2019re spending a lot of time on integrations. They spend a lot of time on developers, spend a lot of resources there. And yes, the customer experience, their end customer experience is not great for that. And therefore, for us, the focus on multi hub is to provide one data model, a single view of the customer, a simple interface that\u2019s easy to use that is crafted and not cobbled together. And I think that\u2019s what our customers liked and that\u2019s what is resonating within the market.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Ryan MacDonald from Needham and Company. Your line is open.\nAlex Narum: So this is Alex Narum on for Ryan. Congratulations on the strong quarter. I was hoping just to get a little bit of additional information on this strength in the international.\nYamini Rangan: Yes. Ryan, thank you for that question. We saw very consistent growth, both in North America, as well as international. As we mentioned, international has been growing really well. I think year-over-year, a few points up from last year. If you step back on international, the market there and digital transformation is in earlier stage. A lot of the customers are in international markets are looking at being digital first, digital ready and really some earlier stages, which means there\u2019s an even bigger opportunity for us. I think the second part is that we\u2019ve been investing steadily in a lot of the international markets from product localization, in terms of content for lead management, in terms of customer facing resources and even brand. And those investments are paying off. Our LTV to CAC is really solid in these markets. And so we\u2019ll continue to invest in international markets. I think the exciting part of it is that North America is a really big market and that\u2019s doing well too. I think we\u2019re seeing very balanced consistent growth across all of the markets that we operate in, so very pleased about that.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Siti Panigrahi from Mizuho. Your line is open.\nMatt Diamond: Hi, everybody. It\u2019s Matt Diamond on for Siti. One quick question for me. Is there anything to be called out for the linearity of bookings this quarter? Your tone certainly suggests that there\u2019s some incremental conviction in the second half. I\u2019m curious if something happened in the quarter that might\u2019ve catalyzed that that may not have been asked more directly?\nKate Bueker: No, there is nothing that I would \u2013 there\u2019s nothing I would share around linearity booking.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Turrin from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nMichael Turrin: Hey there. Thanks. Good afternoon. Yamini, congrats on the promotion. I hope regardless you\u2019re planning to keep the whole music for earnings calls the same. I mean, I go to sleep, but it\u2019s much more pleasant with the jam music than the classical. So I certainly appreciate it. I mean, there\u2019ve been some questions on it, but the average revenue per customer metrics certainly stands out as do comments on just expectations that try and can hold for the rest of the year. So can we just go back to that? I\u2019m wondering if some of that\u2019s just tied this being the other side of the strong customer ad strength we\u2019ve seen over the past year? And then just how much the new hubs and what you\u2019re doing with bundling also just helping out there. Thank you.\nYamini Rangan: Yes. I mean, I think you\u2019ve got it in terms of the underlying theme. We\u2019ve talked about this in the past. There is a lot of quarter-over-quarter variability in those KPI metrics in particular, the customer additions in the ASRPC. And what we saw this quarter was strong Professional and Enterprise trends, strong install base selling trends. And as a result, what you\u2019re seeing is that ASRPC is up nicely year-over-year. And frankly, if you strip out the Starter and looked at ASRPC, it\u2019s like up even more. And so, we don\u2019t guide as you know, to our KPI metrics. And frankly, we don\u2019t guide because that\u2019s not how we manage the business. And so, I shared some commentary around back half in the prepared remarks around the expectations. We think that we should see net customer ads for the back half of the year in and around what we saw in Q2 and with that would come an ASRPC growth in those high single digits.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Turits from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nMichael Turits: Hey guys. Congrats to Brian and Yamini. Kate, just briefly, you mentioned a bit on the strength in the Pro and then a position for new customers, anything in particular \u2013 obviously it\u2019s one thing to add a starter a while ago to our pricing driven new customers to see that that strengthen in the Pro and Enterprise and for new customers is impressive. So how\u2019d you get that?\nKate Bueker: Yes. Thanks. This is \u2013 it\u2019s not a new thing for Q3 and for Q2, we talked about it last quarter as well. We had really strong new customer additions in Pro and Enterprise in Q1 and Q2. And I think for all of the reasons that Yamini has talked about throughout the call.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Brent Bracelin from Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nBrent Bracelin: Thank you. And Yamini, congrats on the promo. Brian, not always great to hear you\u2019re healthy, but also great to hear your plan to remain active with the broader team here. Again wanted to go back to the durability of growth here. We\u2019ve been trained here in the last four years, not to think of ASRPC as a driver to growth. In fact, it\u2019s been a slight drag in the growth over the last four years. This quarter five-year high at 8%, it\u2019s emerged as an incremental growth lever to the business. My question is, are we entering a new period where we could see both strong new customer additions and this revenue expansion, ASRPC expansion as a incremental lever to growth? Or is it too early to, to really weigh in on that? I get that you have some easy comparisons here. But it does feel like we are entering a new period here where this could be a nice incremental level to growth as well.\nYamini Rangan: Yes. I guess, what I would tell you is and we\u2019ve been talking about this over the last three quarters is that we have seen really nice customer additions and quarter-over-quarter expansion of ASRPC. I think this quarter marks a little bit of a different milestone where we\u2019re seeing a real increase on a year-over-year basis as well. I think what you would be surprised, if I declared something here, what I\u2019m going to tell you is that we expect that we will continue to see variability quarter in and quarter out of ASRPC and new customer ads. And that\u2019s going to come as we innovate at the high end, innovate at the low end, introduce some new products. And so I think I shared our expectations for the back half of this year. But I don\u2019t think we are at a point where we would declare sort of a long-term trend at this point.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Kirk Materne from Evercore. Your line is open.\nKirk Materne: Thanks very much. And I\u2019ll echo the congrats to both Brian and Yamini. Yamini maybe just on the Pro and Enterprise side of the business seeing such good traction. I was just wondering how do you think about the evolution of your partner platform as you start talking more of these customers that have maybe more bespoke needs. Are there things you\u2019re thinking about in terms of trying to leave various features for your partners to develop? Or you think about sort of focusing on partners that might have more vertical expertise in certain areas where you\u2019re seeing trends? I guess, just at a high level, how are you thinking about sort of the evolution of the partner ecosystem? Thanks.\nYamini Rangan: Sure. So this is Dharmesh. When we think of the ecosystems, there\u2019s actually multiple parts where there\u2019s the kind of app platform and the app ecosystem where there\u2019s software companies building integrations and extending HubSpot. And there is the solutions partner ecosystem, which basically help us service HubSpot and then bring it to the different markets. So I\u2019ll let Yamini speak to the solutions partner side. On the app platform, we\u2019ve seen great traction, more and more companies building and extending HubSpot and using their APIs. And the thing we love about that is that it really kind of spins the flywheel. The more of those applications, we get, the more of our customer problem we solve. We\u2019ve seen a strong correlation between the number of apps on users and their retention rates. That\u2019s awesome. And the more apps we have, the more customers we get. So those things kind of feed each other and kind of fuel the flywheel. So the app platform itself is going really well. Now let Yamini speak to the solutions part of the program.\nYamini Rangan: Yes. I think that\u2019s a really good commentary on the app side. I think on the solution partner side, we are diversifying our entire ecosystem and our partners are continuing to go there in terms of CRM implementations, integrations, much more complex implementations. And we are really focused on this. Earlier this year at Partner Kickoff, we went to our partners and we said, look, we want to scale with you. So the strategy has been scale with partners, which means we will sell more with partners and enable our partners to service our customers. And that\u2019s good for our customers and that\u2019s good for partners and therefore it\u2019s good for HubSpot. And in terms of the investments with our solutions partner ecosystem, we\u2019ll continue to work on improved incentives. We have been investing pretty heavily on enabling our partners, so they can go to market with us when we do product launches and that\u2019s beginning to work and we\u2019ll continue to invest in scaling services through the partners. And so we definitely see them as part of scaling HubSpot and they play a critical role.\nOperator: There are no further questions. I will now turn the call back over to Brian Halligan, Executive Chairman for closing remarks.\nBrian Halligan: Thanks everyone for joining and look forward to see you at the virtual Analyst Day.\nOperator: Thank you, presenters. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day. You may all disconnect.",

            "content": "One thing that we've seen \u2013 we talked about custom objects, which has been really well received, we're continuing to pull on that thread. So we have custom objects, but for the data associations, things that customers have been asking for, and the idea there is for a company to be able to model this entire business within HubSpot. So the more flexible database gets, the more data we can hold there as a higher percentage of 200 to 2000 segments we can serve well. That's a great question. Ken, thank you. So taking a step back, we think about CMS at and why we're in that business. So CMS has one of the things that make HubSpot unique. There are no other leading CRM platforms that have a legit content management system as part of their overall platform offering, if you ask that why is that, I think the reason is because it's really hard to build a CMS. It's different from everything else it's like picking up trombone, which is like, okay, well, it's kind of hard. You have to use that sliding thing to kind of find them there's no keys or anything like that. It's difficult. By the way, I always thought you think of an official musical term in case you're wondering, but the reason, but if you have a marching band, you need a trombone. That's what kind of complete the thing. And so you need it. If you want a full CRM platform, you need a CMS. And the reason is not just about putting a website up there. It's about making the website a window into the backend data, into the CRM itself and bringing the customer in it's about forging that connection. So we're really excited about it. In terms of why would we launch a starter here, it's basically exactly what you were alluding to. We think getting this kind of web experience up is the first step often in the digital journey that we want customers to take that first step correctly. So we want to bring as many people on the platform, even CMS starts using as we possibly can. And it kind of gets them onto the CRM platform from HubSpot and helps us kind of grow from there. So we're super excited about the opportunity to open. Yes. One thing I'll add is that as you would expect to see 1000 companies, I want to make that digital transformation be digital first, but that kind of path to digital transformation is often paved with good intentions, but really terrible IT implementation, it's so complicated because they have all the database and multiple systems. So this kind of value proposition the HubSpot bring, which is we can simplify that, we can bring it all together into one operating system, one platform, one database, one experience, one company to call is a very compelling value proposition because most of these mid-market companies are dealing with that complexity as they scale and we help with that. It's resonating really well."

            "name": "Kate Bueker",
            "content": "Thanks, Yamini. Let's turn to our second quarter financial results and our guidance for the third quarter and full year of 2021. Second quarter revenue grew 47% year-over-year in constant currency and 53% as reported. Q2 subscription revenue grew 53% year-over-year, while services and other revenue increased 44%, both on an as reported basis. We continued to see strong performance across all of our hubs, tiers and geographies in Q2. Revenue retention continued to be very strong in the quarter, once again benefiting from healthy customer dollar retention levels. In addition, our net revenue retention continued to benefit from a diverse set of upgrade drivers with particular strengths from addition upgrades, cross sell activity and seat expansions. As of Q2, 58% of our customers are getting value out of two or more hubs as they adopt HubSpot as a platform. Domestic revenue grew 42% in Q2, while international revenue growth was 54% year-over-year in constant currency and 68% as reported. International revenue represented 46% of total revenue in Q2, up four points year-over-year. We added over 7,100 net customers in the quarter bringing our total customer count to 121,000, up 40% year-over-year. Average subscription revenue per customer grew 8% year-over-year to approximately $10,200. As we saw a positive mix shift toward our professional and enterprise tiers, coupled with strong install base selling in the quarter. We expect our strong install base selling and positive product mix shift to continue through the second half of 2021. As a result, we anticipate second half net customer additions to sustain around these levels, as we continue to compare against the robust Starter Growth Suite customer additions from 2020. And we expect high single digits year-over-year growth in ASRPC in Q3 and Q4. Deferred revenue, as of the end of June, was $362 million, a 50% increase year-over-year. Calculated billing was $334 million growing 60% year-over-year in constant currency and 65% as reported. This acceleration in constant currency billings growth was driven by strong business performance in the quarter, in addition to an easier overall comparison as a result of the challenging business environment in the second quarter of 2020. The remainder of my comments will refer to non-GAAP measures. Second quarter gross margin was 81%, down a little over one point year-over-year. Subscription gross margin was 84%, while services' gross margin was negative 5%. Second quarter operating margin was 9% relatively flat as compared to the same period a year ago. Operating margin in the quarter exceeded our expectations primarily as a result of our strong revenue performance. At the end of the second quarter, we had just under 5,000 employees, up 32% year-over-year. Net income in the second quarter was $22 million or $0.43 for fully diluted share. CapEx including capitalized software development costs was $16 million or 5% of revenue in Q2. Free cash flow in the quarter was $26 million or 8% of revenue. We continue to expect CapEx as a percentage of revenue to be about 5% in 2021 and now expect free cash flow to be between $170 million and $175 million with a seasonally strong free cash flow quarter in Q4. Finally, our cash and marketable securities totaled $1.3 billion at the end of June. And with that, let's dive into guidance for the third quarter and full year of 2021. For the third quarter, total revenue is expected to be in the range of $325 million to $327 million, up 43% year-over-year at the midpoint. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be between $27 million and $29 million. Non-GAAP diluted net income per share is expected to be between $0.42 and $0.44. This assumes 50.6 million fully diluted shares outstanding. And for the full year of 2021, total revenue is now expected to be in the range of $1.268 billion to $1.272 billion, up 44% year-over-year at the midpoint. Non-GAAP operating income is now expected to be between $107 million and $109 million. Non-GAAP diluted net income per share is now expected to be between $1.67 and $1.69. This assumes 50.5 million fully diluted shares outstanding. As you adjust your models, keep in mind the following. At current spot rates, we're forecasting an FX tailwind to as reported revenue of two points in Q3, a neutral impact to Q4 and a three point tailwind for the full year. Lastly, I look forward to seeing many of you again for our virtual analyst day as part of our inbound 2021 event on October 12. And with that, I'll hand things over to Brian for some closing thoughts. Yes. Sure things, Samad. [Technical Difficulty] Q2 \u2013 there's not much out of the ordinary here. There's not a lot of big changes in duration. The biggest driver of the billings performance was the strong bookings growth that we had in the quarter. The one thing that I would point out and you kind of got it in the question is that there is a relatively easier compare for billings relative to revenue in constant currency. You might remember last year in Q2, we ran a number of short term customer release plays that had a bit of a negative impact on our Q2 2020 billings. And so billings time is frankly, a little bit of an easier comp in revenue. Yes. Maybe I'll start with some numbers and pass it on to Yamini for a little bit more color and context. We've talked about this for a number of quarters, the growth in our multiproduct adoption, so customers who use two or more of our products has been on this sort of steady trajectory up for a number of years now. And not have happened across all of the tiers from the enterprise to the starter. We did see a bit of a step function in flection last spring when we introduced the Starter Growth Suite that really simple $50 price point, easy to buy. And so we see a lot of uptake at that starter level of just the full set of HubSpot products. As I shared in my prepared remarks, we're at 58% of our customers who are using more than one HubSpot product. And when you look at that new customers are probably 50-50 now adopting multiple HubSpot products. No, there is nothing that I would \u2013 there's nothing I would share around linearity booking. Yes. Thanks. This is \u2013 it's not a new thing for Q3 and for Q2, we talked about it last quarter as well. We had really strong new customer additions in Pro and Enterprise in Q1 and Q2. And I think for all of the reasons that Yamini has talked about throughout the call."

            "content": "Thanks, Chuck and greetings, everyone. Thank you for joining us today as we review HubSpot's second quarter 2021 earnings results. I know you've likely seen the exciting news that Brian will be taking on the role of Executive Chairman as of September 7th. We're all looking forward to having Brian back in action and stronger than ever when he returns next month. Brian will be joining the call here in a few minutes to talk about the path forward in this new capacity, as well as to share some reflections on the 15 years that have led us to today's news and this quarter fantastic results. Before we do that, I want to focus on the business at hand, the great results from last quarter. We continue to operate from a broad position of strength with Q2 revenue growth accelerating to 47% year-over-year in constant currency and total customers growing 40% year-over-year to over 121,000. We've seen multi-product adoption growth to over half of our total customers. A great indicator that more companies are realizing the advantage of managing their entire front office on one platform, with one data model, one view of their customers and one user interface that's easy to use. A key driver of this continued growth is digital transformation we're seeing as more companies have had to adapt to doing business online. This shift towards digitally powered customer experiences is one that HubSpot has been evangelizing for the past 15 years. So we've been about the vision to meet the moment. As consumers increasingly expect remarkable digital experiences at each step of their journey, scaling companies need a powerful CRM platform to tie it all together. This makes CRM not just a nice to have solution, but an indispensable driver of long-term growth for our customers. A key part of that digital experience is the company website. This is a digital front door. Traditional website content management systems are often siloed from other essential front office functions. They're complex to manage, they lack speed, security and scalability that companies need to grow their business. That's why we launched CMS Hub Professional and Enterprise last year and we are continuing to invest in the platform with CMS Hub Starter launched yesterday. CMS Hub Starter is built as part of our CRM platform to give companies seamless access to all of their customer data. Having a CRM powered website enables both marketers and developers to efficiently work together to build remarkable digital experiences and maximize the revenue generating opportunity. As part of that launch, we also adjusted the pricing of our CMS Hub Professional and Enterprise tiers to reflect the increased value we are delivering to our customers through SEO enhancement, dynamic pages, site trees and increased limits and capacity with even more advanced features in the roadmap. We're still in early stages of this launch, but we are confident that CMS Hub Starter was still a painful gap for marketers and developers that are looking to spend less time managing their system and more time driving growth. Another important function of digital first transformation is revenue operations. Last quarter, I talked about the launch of Operations Hub, a new product designed to transform the role of operations professionals and empower them to become strategic drivers of revenue and growth. I'm excited to share that we are continuing to hear positive feedback from customers and partners and that's Operations Hub has performed nicely ahead of our internal growth expectations over the past quarter and a half. Data Sync, our robust new integration engine has quickly become one of the most compelling and popular free tools, particularly amongst small customers, exemplifying how Operations Hub will drive adoption of our CRM platform. We're also seeing strong adoption of programmable automation among the larger companies who are looking to take full advantage of their data and deliver personalized experiences to their customers. One of our top solutions partners had this to say about the feature. Programmable automation makes HubSpot significantly more flexible. We've used it to build even the most advanced business processes in HubSpot from ERP integrations to data enrichment, commission, calculations to renewal communications. With programmable automation in Operations Hub, if you can dream it, you can automate it. Thanks to the team at Aptitude 8 for sharing the feedback. We're so glad that they're seeing value in Operations Hub. Both Operations Hub and CMS Hub Starter are great examples of our commitment to crafting our CRM platform in-house rather than coddling it together through clunky acquisitions, that's focused on delivering a consumer grade UI matched with a scalable enterprise backend sets us apart from traditional CRM platforms and puts HubSpot in a strong position to achieve our goal of becoming the number one CRM platform for scaling companies. With that, I'll turn it over to Kate to give an overview of our fantastic financial results. Thank you so much, Brian, for your kind words and for your incredible support during my time here at HubSpot. I'm deeply humbled, grateful, and super excited to take on this new role in partnership with you, Dharmesh and the entire HubSpot team. It was your visionary leadership as founders that got us here today. And that leadership will continue to be invaluable, as HubSpot grows. I'm excited to continue working together to build innovative products for our customers who use a remarkable culture for our employees and ultimately make HubSpot the number one CRM platform for scaling company. Operator, please open up the call for some questions. Well, thank you, Brian. And I have I'm so humbled, grateful, and super excited to take this new role and write the next chapter of growth at HubSpot. It's not \u2013 I would say, I'm particularly excited because I get to work with two brilliant people Brian and Dharmesh, who've done this for 15 years who have fantastic experience. The three of us share a lot in common of growth mindset, just curiosity, focus on product innovation, focus on customer centricity and I think the combination of their experience, plus my focus on scaling customers is going to be powerful. You asked the question about the vision and strategy. Our vision is clear. Our vision is to help millions of organizations grow better, and we're just getting started in accomplishing that vision. And for strategy, over the last six months or the last couple of years it's been working, it's clear and it's not changing. And if I had to articulate the strategy, it's threefold. First off, we want to build a best-in-class CRM platform for scaling companies. And we'll do this by expanding to new hubs like you saw us do with operations sub last quarter, and we'll do this by investing heavily into our existing of hubs you've heard about the CMS hub this quarter. We have just a long way to go a lot more to do in terms of the product. The second part of our strategy is fueling all of our segments. Now we focus on the one to 2000 segment and historically they've been really good at the 20 to 200 and we have unparalleled product market fit there. We've been investing heavily in the lower end of the segment, one to 20, and we'll continue to invest in the 200 to 2000. So we have just a great enterprise class of products with consumer grade ease of use, and this is working. And finally, the third part of the strategy I'm very excited about is that we want to continue to build an organization that can scale. We care deeply about our employees. We care deeply about diversity, and we want HubSpot to be the place that's maybe the best place for people to work and serve our customers. So I am super excited to get started on this journey and write the next chapter of growth at HubSpot. Yes. Thanks a lot, Mark. Good to hear your voice and appreciate your wish for both Brian and myself. I say that enterprise, all of the product investments that we have making an enterprises working. Our strategy is really to build products that fit every one of our segments and our up market segments from 200 to 2000, that's been a focus area for us now last year we powered up marketing pop and the lot of the features that we announced at the beginning of the year deeply resonated with our customers. And as inbound, we launched sales hub enterprise, as you know, and custom objects, huge hit a lot of the CPQ advanced features that we added huge hit. In Q1 of this year, we added conversation intelligence. Now it's a category in and of itself, and the fact that we added it to power a hub and is now a seamless part of our whole suite that is resonating deeply within the market. So our strategy for continuing to build powerhouse features while maintaining the ease of use that is consumer grade things. That is what is working and broadly, if you look at the up market, we're just getting a fair share of a fast and growing market, and we'll continue to invest both on product as well as go to market to continue feeling that. That's a great question. I think it goes back to the earlier thoughts in terms of strategy. Our strategy is clear. We have a focus on having the best CRM suite in the market. That means we'll continue to invest in our existing hubs and we'll continue to make new investments in additional hubs. Then there's plenty of ideas. Mark, we just came from our annual strategy offsite in June and we have in our collective heads product innovation for the next 15 years. And the focus on horizon one, horizon two, horizon three bets have worked really well for the company. And my job is to work with Brian, Dharmesh to really empower that type of innovation going forward as we've gotten. I also think that our focus in terms of all of the segments, we've fired off every portion of our segments. And the way I look at it is how do we continue to optimize where we are strong, which is the 20 to 200 segment, but how do we continue to optimize the product led motion at the bottom end, as well as the up market motion through the investments that we have. And so that will continue to be the focus and I'm super excited. I think we have the right leadership team in product. We have the right leadership team and execution focused team in the go-to-market and I'm really excited to work with all of them. Yes. Many uptick inside of it. I think that it's sort of interesting to see where we had a really strong quarter and that will tell you where you're seeing the real drivers of that ASP growth. The first thing I would say is our new business, our new additions were particularly strong in the professional and enterprise tiers, which tend to have a larger ASP. We had a really strong quarter selling into the install base, including a record quarter for nominal upgrade from starter into professional and enterprise tiers. And then, you also saw the fueling of the cross sell with the addition of the operations hub. And then I guess the final thing that I would highlight is just an expansion in the number of seats that we're seeing our professional and enterprise customers on the sales side. Yes. Thanks a lot, Stan for the question. In general, our pricing philosophy is twofold, what you will see us do is continue to bring high value added features down to our premium and started here. And what does insure us is that we managed disruption within our install base versus allowing competitors to disrupt us. The second part of the strategy is that it also ensures that we keep innovating and adding new features to our higher tiers pro and enterprise. And so that's our broader pricing philosophy. It's worked really well for us. That's exactly what you saw do with CMS. As we have added more features to enterprise and parole, we feel pretty comfortable that we are delivering a lot more value to our customers and therefore \u2013 there's confidence in kind of increasing that price. And in terms of your second question on grandfathering, very similar to floor we'll first roll this out, this will impact all of the new customers and then over a period of time moves that problem. Yes, thanks. We saw another really strong quarter of both customer dollar retention and net revenue retention, the story that we would tell you about retention in Q2 is basically the same story that I told you that retention in Q1. It starts with that foundation of customer dollar retention, where we've seen like really healthy trends there since the back half of 2020. And then again, similar to last quarter, there were a real diversity in terms of the upsell motions that are really driving the positive net revenue retention. I would echo that Brian's like super active, always sounding us and always inspiring us. So that's pretty good. We're glad to have him back in full force. So Alex, question in terms of demand environment comparing first half and second half? Our demand environment is solid, similar to what we saw in the last quarter. Now, if you stepped back, our product is really unique relative to competition. I say we have a very, very strong value proposition that is resonating in the market. And Brian talked about sowing seeds. I think we've done enough product investments in the past few years and just seeing all of that payoff, we not only have that product market fit, but we also have a go to market fit. And the combination of those two are really helping us drive really strong financial results. In terms of pipeline, I'd say that the digital first and digital is ready. Both of those trends are here to stay. We're not going back from here. We are clearly seeing our customers modernizing their CRM platform from websites to marketing, to sales and service. They're all focused on delivering a connected customer experience and that's the kind of customer interest that you're seeing from a pipeline. And in July, at the very beginning of the quarter, we actually gave our entire global employee base a week of rest. And we did that, it was a very important choice. We care about culture. We care about employees. We wanted them to rest, recharge and come back with a full focus in second half. And that was the right thing to do. And I think I'm really feeling good about the second half and looking forward to \u2013 now what we're going to do in the second half. Yes. We'll probably talk in a lot more detail around retention in general at the upcoming analyst day, but I would give you maybe a couple of points to take away customer dollar retention, which is not the same as logo retention, but is sort of the baseline of how we think about it internally is very strong and show specific improvements through the back half of 2020 and sort of stayed at that new elevated level for the first and second quarter of this year, and I think it sounds kind of elementary, but the truth is that what we're seeing is that our customers are just using the products more. And as it turns out that leads to higher retention and we are as a result enjoying really healthy core retention levels. Terry, thank you for the wishes, I really appreciate it. I think in terms of the install base, like our existing customers now have a lot more products that they can adopt, right? And in the past couple of quarters, we have introduced Operations Hub, we have improved the additions on a number of hubs, and so there's a lot more product for them to adopt. And I think that product has gotten much better. So when our customers are on one hub and then they see the value of a seamless single data model, single interface of other hubs that naturally pulls them in. So the product investments are probably the first ones that I've talked about. I think the second part of it is that we certainly from a go-to-market perspective have invested more heavily in our customer success team, working more closely with our sales team, and that helps us connect the dots in terms of install base. And that's certainly been part of it. Now going forward, I'd say, we want to have a balanced approach. We would \u2013 we continue to acquire a lot of new customers because of the strong value propositions that we deliver and we continue to sell into the install base. So you'll see a balance of both of these across our future quarters. That's a great question, DJ. That's fantastic question. I will \u2013 let's say the buyer for Operations Hub is a revenue of persona. Now I spent a better part of the couple of decades in CRM running these operations teams and they're really the nerve centers of go-to-market functions. They're sometimes the unsung heroes, but they have a really critical role to play, which is providing the single source of truth about customers to the VP of sales and marketing, and the head of customer success. That's the persona and they've always been involved in a CRM purchase and now we're providing them the flexibility and the power for them to deliver insights into the front office. And if you really step back on Operations Hubs, it's a couple of things. It really helps our customers connect their tech stack, it helps our customers clean up the data, it helps our customers automate the processes and these three challenges are traditionally the ones that revenue operations teams and all of our customers struggle with. And so it's really helping that critical persona be very, very successful. And we see a lot of traction. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we are seeing very positive feedback from our customers as well as partners and programmable automation has been on fire, really good traction. Clean use case of that is lead routing. You want to do advance lead routing, you are able to take all of the data from CRM, but also figure out the rep capacity, rep seniority, rep is on vacation, rep is on sabbatical and use all of that information to now be able to automate your processes. And so Operations Hub provides flexibility, automates processes and supercharges our CRM suite. Yes. Brian, I will address that and then have maybe Kate or Dharmesh jump in. You're exactly right. Like if you think about our customers, they're coming through this whole pandemic thing, one, I need to digitize my entire front office and the starting point could be very different. The starting point could be a bunch of point solutions. It could be greenfield, they're using something like a spreadsheet, or they have a legacy system. And they're looking at providing an entire connected customer experience. And therefore, having an all in one solution resonates pretty deeply with them. And that's part of what they're enabling through the CRM suite. And we definitely see that motions beginning to happen. And I think we'll continue to invest in CRM suite. Now the CRM suite is like very powerful. One of the things that for us works is that when you get CRM suite in the hands of new customers or existing customers, they now see the power of the entire platform. There is higher product usage. Therefore, we get much better feedback on the product. Therefore, we can improve the product. And it's a nice little flywheel in terms of how we can drive the quality of our product even higher. And so there's a lot of goodness and certainly that's what we're seeing in terms of trends from our customers. Yes. I think to add to the commentary that Kate provided. I think if you step back, we thought something really important having all of these products, which is we take a very crafted approach to CRM. It is not cobbled together through acquisitions. And if you step back and think about the single biggest challenge for customers, they're putting together very complex tech stacks and they're spending a lot of time on integrations. They spend a lot of time on developers, spend a lot of resources there. And yes, the customer experience, their end customer experience is not great for that. And therefore, for us, the focus on multi hub is to provide one data model, a single view of the customer, a simple interface that's easy to use that is crafted and not cobbled together. And I think that's what our customers liked and that's what is resonating within the market. Yes. Ryan, thank you for that question. We saw very consistent growth, both in North America, as well as international. As we mentioned, international has been growing really well. I think year-over-year, a few points up from last year. If you step back on international, the market there and digital transformation is in earlier stage. A lot of the customers are in international markets are looking at being digital first, digital ready and really some earlier stages, which means there's an even bigger opportunity for us. I think the second part is that we've been investing steadily in a lot of the international markets from product localization, in terms of content for lead management, in terms of customer facing resources and even brand. And those investments are paying off. Our LTV to CAC is really solid in these markets. And so we'll continue to invest in international markets. I think the exciting part of it is that North America is a really big market and that's doing well too. I think we're seeing very balanced consistent growth across all of the markets that we operate in, so very pleased about that. Yes. I mean, I think you've got it in terms of the underlying theme. We've talked about this in the past. There is a lot of quarter-over-quarter variability in those KPI metrics in particular, the customer additions in the ASRPC. And what we saw this quarter was strong Professional and Enterprise trends, strong install base selling trends. And as a result, what you're seeing is that ASRPC is up nicely year-over-year. And frankly, if you strip out the Starter and looked at ASRPC, it's like up even more. And so, we don't guide as you know, to our KPI metrics. And frankly, we don't guide because that's not how we manage the business. And so, I shared some commentary around back half in the prepared remarks around the expectations. We think that we should see net customer ads for the back half of the year in and around what we saw in Q2 and with that would come an ASRPC growth in those high single digits. Yes. I guess, what I would tell you is and we've been talking about this over the last three quarters is that we have seen really nice customer additions and quarter-over-quarter expansion of ASRPC. I think this quarter marks a little bit of a different milestone where we're seeing a real increase on a year-over-year basis as well. I think what you would be surprised, if I declared something here, what I'm going to tell you is that we expect that we will continue to see variability quarter in and quarter out of ASRPC and new customer ads. And that's going to come as we innovate at the high end, innovate at the low end, introduce some new products. And so I think I shared our expectations for the back half of this year. But I don't think we are at a point where we would declare sort of a long-term trend at this point. Sure. So this is Dharmesh. When we think of the ecosystems, there's actually multiple parts where there's the kind of app platform and the app ecosystem where there's software companies building integrations and extending HubSpot. And there is the solutions partner ecosystem, which basically help us service HubSpot and then bring it to the different markets. So I'll let Yamini speak to the solutions partner side. On the app platform, we've seen great traction, more and more companies building and extending HubSpot and using their APIs. And the thing we love about that is that it really kind of spins the flywheel. The more of those applications, we get, the more of our customer problem we solve. We've seen a strong correlation between the number of apps on users and their retention rates. That's awesome. And the more apps we have, the more customers we get. So those things kind of feed each other and kind of fuel the flywheel. So the app platform itself is going really well. Now let Yamini speak to the solutions part of the program. Yes. I think that's a really good commentary on the app side. I think on the solution partner side, we are diversifying our entire ecosystem and our partners are continuing to go there in terms of CRM implementations, integrations, much more complex implementations. And we are really focused on this. Earlier this year at Partner Kickoff, we went to our partners and we said, look, we want to scale with you. So the strategy has been scale with partners, which means we will sell more with partners and enable our partners to service our customers. And that's good for our customers and that's good for partners and therefore it's good for HubSpot. And in terms of the investments with our solutions partner ecosystem, we'll continue to work on improved incentives. We have been investing pretty heavily on enabling our partners, so they can go to market with us when we do product launches and that's beginning to work and we'll continue to invest in scaling services through the partners. And so we definitely see them as part of scaling HubSpot and they play a critical role."

Now it's my pleasure to turn over the call to HubSpot's Co-Founder and Chief Technology Officer, Dharmesh Shah.\nDharmesh Shah: Thanks, Chuck, and greetings, everyone. Thank you for joining us today as we review HubSpot's first quarter 2021 earnings results. Before we jump in, I'd like to give you a quick update on Brian. He's in good spirits and is well on his way to a full recovery. And while we're all looking forward to having him back, Yamini continues to lead day-to-day operations. Under her leadership, the team remains energized and well positioned to continue helping both HubSpot and our customers grow better. Now on to the results, which have been remarkable. As we round a full year of living and working in the midst of a pandemic, we've continued to see very strong growth across the business. Both revenue and customer growth accelerated from Q4. This has been driven in part by a significant demand for digital transformation. More and more companies are shifting to a digitally-powered, if not digital-first customer experience. It just so happens that we've been evangelizing this transformation since our founding nearly 15 years ago. As Brian said a few earnings calls ago, it feels like our vision matches the moment we're in. We've seen an acceleration in companies adapting to doing business online. This has made CRM not just important but indispensable. Digital first can't happen in 1 part of your customer journey and not another, and a strong comprehensive CRM platform is the thing that ties it all together. Our ambition is to become the number one CRM platform for scaling companies, and we're working towards that goal in two key ways: One, we're bringing high-end features only available to larger enterprises down to mid-market companies; and two, we're bringing a human friendly product and purchasing experience traditionally seen in small and mid-market businesses up to larger enterprises. HubSpot CRM platform is crafted in-house, not cobbled together with acquisitions. That's why it's powerful and easy to use instead of being clunky and expensive like many traditional enterprise platforms. This is at the heart of what makes HubSpot different. We're continuing to invest significantly in the platform and recently introduced the HubSpot CRM suite, which is designed to help our customers unlock the full power of our CRM platform. The CRM suite replaces the growth suite bundle and now includes CMS Hub and our new operations hub. This gives customers access to all of our starter, professional and enterprise products at a price point that delivers tremendous value. This is a win for our customers and moves us further towards being the number one CRM platform for scaling companies. I'm really excited about the progress we've made in the past year, but I'm even more excited about the path ahead. With 2021 already off to a strong start, we're in a great position to keep helping our customers create delightful end-to-end experiences for their customers and ultimately, grow better. With that, I'll hand it over to Yamini.\nYamini Rangan: Thanks so much, Dharmesh. Hey, everyone. I'm excited to share a business update and touch upon our go-to-market as well as our product innovation with you all. As you just heard, we've continued to see tremendous performance across the business with an acceleration of Q1 revenue growth to 37% year-over-year in constant currency and customer growth of 45% year-over-year. We set records in net new customer additions and revenue retentions in the quarter and are operating from a broad position of strength. Our products and geographies continued to perform well in Q1, but I want to focus on two particular areas of note in our go-to-market, segmentation and partner alignment. One of the key pillars of our go-to-market strategy is our customer segmentation approach. We want HubSpot to be easy to buy, easy to use and easy to love for the customer segments we serve and are optimizing how we sell to and support our customers. Historically, we've had great product and go-to-market fit in serving the needs of companies with 20 to 200 employees. Our goal is to expand the focus to drive increased efficiency in the 2- to 20-employee segment and improved sales productivity in the 200- to 2,000-employee segment. At the low end, we're investing in automation and product live growth, which frees up our sales team to focus on larger deals. And at the high end, we are investing in product and sales enablement to cater to the needs of larger companies. We are seeing strong customer additions as a result of the simplification and automation at the low end, balanced by strong ASP driven at the high end. These investments are translating into multi-hub deals, full platform deals and larger deals across the board. We're still in early days of implementing the strategy, but we feel really good about the traction we've seen thus far. Another key pillar of our go-to-market strategy is investing in our partner ecosystem. As we expand our platform, we're seeing the types of partners we have in our ecosystem continue to diversify. That diversification of our partners will drive growth for us as we work to serve the needs of scaling companies, and we are already starting to see that opportunity come to fruition. According to a new white paper from IDC, the HubSpot ecosystem made up of application and solution partners is forecasted to grow faster than HubSpot as the ecosystem revenue grows from nearly $5 billion in 2020 to over $12 billion in 2024. This represents a broad-based opportunity for HubSpot and our partners moving forward. Now I want to switch gears a little bit to talk about another important pillar of our business, our product. We recently expanded our suite of tools with the launch of Operations Hub. This new hub is designed to transform the role of operations professionals and empower them to become strategic drivers of revenue and growth. Through our research and in talking to customers, we've heard very clearly that operations professionals often have to do duplicative and reactive work. This is because they operate in functional silos and lack access to clean data and automated processes. Our operations teams have essentially become reactive firefighters. We want to help transform them into proactive and strategic friction fighters. Operations hub breaks down silos between functional business units and provides the foundation for revenue operations teams to work across a single source of truth. It helps our customers connect their tech stack, clean the data and automate their processes. It keeps them fast and flexible as they scale. And most importantly, it keeps their customer experience friction-free so they can run better to grow better. And as we've previously shared, HubSpot's growth will be driven by a balance of continued investment in our existing hubs, while also investing in new hubs to address our customers' adjacent front office needs. We know that revenue operations professionals are key decision makers for CRM. And with the launch of Operations Hub, we've expanded our offering to an entirely new persona while also making it easier than ever for companies to build their entire customer experience on the HubSpot CRM platform. In the first 10 days after the launch, more than 500 customers purchased operations hub. We're incredibly excited about the momentum we have seen from customers since launch. And the feedback we've heard from partners that far and feel strongly that operations hub will play an important part in HubSpot becoming the CRM platform of choice for scaling companies. With that, let me turn it over to Kate to walk through our financial results.\nKate Bueker: Thanks, Yamini. Let's turn to our first quarter financial results and our guidance for the second quarter and full year of 2021. First quarter revenue grew 37% year-over-year in constant currency and 41% as reported. Q1 subscription revenue grew 41% year-over-year, while services and other revenue increased 43%, both on an as reported basis. If you exclude the impact of nonrecurring hustle revenue in the quarter, services and other revenue would have grown 33% in Q1. As Yamini indicated, we continue to see broad strength across all of our hubs, peers and geographies. Q1 revenue retention set another all-time high driven by record customer dollar retention and particular strength in addition upgrade and seat expansion activities. Customers continue to adopt HubSpot as a platform and over 55% of our customers are getting value out of two or more hubs today. Domestic revenue grew 33% in Q1, while international revenue growth was 42% year-over-year in constant currency and 51% as reported. International revenue represented 45% of total revenue in Q1, up 3 points year-over-year. We added a record 9,900 net customers in the quarter, bringing our total customer count to nearly 114,000, up 45% year-over-year. Average subscription revenue per customer of nearly 9,900 was up 1 point sequentially but down 1 point year-over-year. Deferred revenue as of the end of March was $339 million, a 40% increase year-over-year. Calculated billings was $304 million in Q1, growing 43% year-over-year in constant currency and 47% as reported. This acceleration in constant currency billings growth was driven by a very strong business performance in the quarter in addition to an easier overall comparison as a result of the challenging business environment in March of 2020. The remainder of my comments will refer to non-GAAP measures. First quarter gross margin was 81%, down slightly year-over-year. Subscription gross margin was 84%, while services gross margin was 8%. If you exclude the impact of nonrecurring hustle revenue and associated gross profit, services gross margin was near breakeven in the quarter, consistent with our long-term services margin target. First quarter operating margin was 7%, relatively flat as compared to the same period a year ago. The revenue overperformance in the quarter was largely offset by an increase in revenue-related costs, added expense from the hustle acquisition, as well as incremental R&D costs associated with investments in our application infrastructure. As I've discussed over the last couple of quarters, we plan to continue to invest aggressively across the business to meet the market demand we're seeing for our products and drive innovation to fuel long-term growth. At the end of the first quarter, we had 4,551 employees, up 27% year-over-year. Net income in the first quarter was $16 million or $0.31 per fully diluted share. CapEx, including capitalized software development costs, was $11 million or 4% of revenue in Q1. Free cash flow in the first quarter was $61 million or 22% of revenue. We continue to expect CapEx as a percentage of revenue to be about 5% in 2021, and now expect free cash flow to be between $155 million and $160 million, with another seasonally strong free cash flow quarter in Q4. Finally, our cash and marketable securities totaled $1.3 billion at the end of March. And with that, let's dive into guidance for the second quarter and full year of 2021. For the second quarter, total revenue is expected to be in the range of $293 million to $297 million, up 45% year-over-year at the midpoint. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be between $19 million and $21 million. Non-GAAP diluted net income per share is expected to be between $0.30 and $0.32. This assumes 50.9 million fully diluted shares outstanding. And for the full year of 2021, total revenue is now expected to be in the range of $1.237 billion to $1.247 billion, up 41% year-over-year at the midpoint. Non-GAAP operating income is now expected to be between $104 million and $106 million. Non-GAAP diluted net income per share is now expected to be between $1.61 and $1.65. This assumes 50.8 million fully diluted shares outstanding. As you adjust your models, keep in mind the following: At current spot rates, we're forecasting an FX tailwind to as reported revenue of 6 points in Q2 and still expect a 3-point tailwind for the full year. And with that, I'll hand things back over to Dharmesh for his closing remarks.\nDharmesh Shah: Thanks, Kate. We're grateful to all of our customers and partners for their support, especially over the past year, the challenges of a global pandemic. It has impacted the lives and livelihoods of millions all over the world. Our hearts especially go out the people of India. They are fighting a humanitarian crisis with a sharp increase in the number of COVID cases. We wish all those impacted around the world brighter days ahead. I also want to extend my thanks to the HubSpot team. I'm so proud of the work they have done over the past year to help our customers and partners. HubSpot's 15 anniversary is coming up in a few weeks but it still feels like our business is in the early innings as we continue to pursue our mission of helping millions of organizations grow better. Thank you for your time. Operator, please open up the call for some questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Brian Peterson from Raymond James.\nBrian Peterson: Congrats on the really strong results. So just to start, I know everyone's thoughts and prayers with Brian. It's great to hear that he's doing better. Your business sounds like it's in really good hands and some impressive results this quarter. But is there anything you can share in terms of the timetable for his return?\nDharmesh Shah: Thanks, Brian. Now for the well wishes. So Brian is doing well. He's in good humor. The team and I are in touch with them regularly. And we talk about things outside of just our favorite Netflix shows at the time. In terms of a date for the return, we don't have anything definitive mind. We have -- Brian is going to take the time that he needs to heal, and we look forward to having him back sometime later this year.\nBrian Peterson: Great. Well, it's great to hear that is joking with you guys in anything good spirits. And maybe a follow-up just on the demand environment. The strength you're seeing this quarter, is that a function of just the ongoing shift towards digital transformation for SMEs? Or anything else that you might be seeing in the market?\nYamini Rangan: Yes. Thanks a lot, Brian. I'll take the question. The demand environment is solid. We saw an improvement in the demand patterns in the last couple of quarters of last year, and we're pleased to see that sustained in here in Q1. So we're seeing continued tailwind. And I'd say, to your point on digital transformation, it's ongoing and it's certainly accelerating within our customer base as they're focused on lot of the digital-first efforts. We think we're still in the very early days in the arc of modern CRM, and we think our customers are going to continue to lean in there. I would say, in addition to that, our value proposition has got much stronger. Our TAM has gotten much bigger over the last few years as we've gone from marketing our company to a CRM platform. The product investments we've made are paying off, and we have an ideal platform to help small and mid-market companies digitize their front office. So our go-to-market is a lockstep with the product expansion and we're seeing very strong execution. So we feel really good about the way things are lining up.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Samad Samana from Jefferies.\nSamad Samana: First, great to see a 40% plus growth return at this scale for the first time since 2016 when that's what you were doing basically on an annual basis. So congrats on the strong start to the year. Maybe this one could be for either Yamini or Dharmesh, but when I think about operations hub, can you talk a little bit about the vision for operations hub? And why this was the next logical hub for you guys to come to market with? And maybe what the early feedback from customers and partners is on use cases? And just maybe how you thinking about impacting the TAM as well? And then I have one follow-up to Kate.\nDharmesh Shah: I'll start off, and Yamini can chime in later. So when HubSpot looks at creating a new hub, we try to look for opportunities where the role in the persona that we're targeting is very well defined. And that those people have very well-defined pain points. In the case of operations hub, the people that we're focused on are sales ops, marketing ops and this kind of newly-emerging revenue ops role. So those are the people. And the three pain points are very distinct. Pain point number one is every mid-market company going through growth is using more and more applications within their infrastructure and having to deal with that kind of integration pain number two, is all of those teams have either inherent or implemented these kind of fragmented, disconnected data silos, so they're contending with that issue; and number three, there's so much that's happening within the organization. That's just manual, lots of manual work and kind of have to throw humans at the problem. So those are three kind of areas of pain. And what we want to do with operations hub, so if you think about kind of the evolution of that role, we kind of started off is [indiscernible] and they had their heads buried in the systems and fragmented data silos. It's gotten a little bit better. They've kind of lifted their heads up now, and they're more like Emus now. So they kind of look around, not quite there yet. What we want to do with operations hub is take them from Emus and elevate them to Eagles, where they have much more visibility, much more velocity. And so I'm very excited about the opportunity behind operations because things are not kind of problems that just a few customers have. Most of our customers have all three of these pain points. So I think the opportunity is big. I'll let Yamini on.\nYamini Rangan: Yes, I completely agree with you, Dharmesh. I would say, Samad, in terms of how we're thinking about the opportunity, I think it's certainly a good way in which we will bundle this. As Dharmesh mentioned, operations hub really supercharges CRM. And so the first opportunity for us is to put it into our CRM suite, which is exactly what we have done. And operations hub, which brings together data crop system, so it's also going to make our CRM suite much more pickier. We also think there is an immediate cross-sell opportunity. We have a growing installed base of customers and the initial reaction from both our customers as well as partners has been really positive, and we think both small as well as mid-market customers are going to really adopt and drive the solution. And on the addressable opportunity, I don't think there's like a number we've been to, but I do think it's a very large multibillion opportunity to consider marketing operations not only opens up the traditional $15 billion PR market, but also data analysis and integration. So we're kind of very excited about how incremental this opportunity is and how this opens it up for us.\nSamad Samana: Great. Appreciate that color. And then, Kate, this was another impressive quarter where both net sub adds was it's really, really robust. And yet, ASRPC increased again quarter-over-quarter. We don't really see that very often with HubSpot's model just the way it works. And so I'd love to dig in further what's driving that between net expansions at existing customers versus maybe larger initial vans or is there something else that maybe we're not even considering that we should factor in?\nKate Bueker: Yes. Thanks, Samad, for noticing. We were certainly very happy with the 9,900 net customer additions in the quarter particularly combined with another quarter of sequential growth of ASRPC. The answer to your question is, frankly, it's a bit of both. Q1 was another quarter where we had a really balanced set of new customer additions across starter and professional and enterprise. And as you heard from Yamini in her prepared remarks, increasingly, we are seeing new customers in that professional enterprise come on as multiproduct customers, and we are also seeing ourselves landing bigger deals. So ASPs of new customers are healthy. We also both highlighted another record retention quarter in Q1, which certainly indicates a strong amount of upsell, which is another tailwind that we're seeing to ASRPC. So both of the things that you're highlighting are contributing to what trends we're seeing on those KPIs.\nSamad Samana: Very helpful. And congrats on the quarter and wishing Brian good health and a speedy recover wherever he's listening from right now.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Alex Zukin from Wolfe Research.\nAlex Zukin: And I'll echo my well wishes to Brian and the rest of the team. I've got a quick just a general question, and then a follow-up for Kate. The first one, maybe just clearly, you guys saw a really nice acceleration in domestic growth and international. Can you talk about any geographies or products, in particular, that are driving the strength here in the U.S. versus internationally? Is it different? Is it the same? Would love to understand that a little bit more.\nYamini Rangan: Yes. Thanks a lot, Alex, for the question. I'll take this. We are really happy with the momentum that we saw, and it's kind of broad-based across all of the geographies. U.S. is large. It's seen growth. We really like the results there and went from 27% to 33% growth. At the same time, all of our international theaters did really well. The flywheel is spinning across all of these and then if you take a step back, we are still very much in early innings and early kind of market penetration, most of the markets that they're operating in and our TAM is really large. The value proposition is strong and resonating across these markets. Unit economics is pretty strong. The cost to acquire customer relative to lifetime value is really solid in these international markets, and so we have continued to invest. And so we're really pleased with the balanced performance that we saw across all of the geos.\nAlex Zukin: That's awesome. And then Kate, maybe one for you. With respect to clearly, another just wonderful quarter around retention. Is it fair to say you've got now better visibility into kind of a new normal kind of dollar-based net retention metric that you can share going forward? And how should we think about as we start lapping some of the tougher comps, the linearity or not the linearity, but the sequential step-up in kind of billings trends just so we don't get too far ahead of ourselves and modeling?\nKate Bueker: Yes. Maybe I'll start with the retention question. Alex, thanks definitely good to see another really strong retention quarter. We set another record. I think as you've seen, we tend to share more detail around some of the KPIs at things like Analyst Day, and so that might be a good opportunity to reset with more specific expectations. What I will say is this. Customer dollar retention was, again, really the key foundation to the overall strength for retention in the quarter. Last year, we saw a dip in customer dollar retention that started in March, again, occurred in Q2. And then in the back half of the year, what we saw is a really pronounced pickup to customer dollar retention. And that strength really continued into Q1. It's frankly, what we're discovering is pretty simple. Our customers are actually using the product more. And as a result, they're retaining better. And then on top of the customer dollar retention, we are seeing really strong installed base selling across really a diverse set of drivers. In my prepared remarks, I called out a particular strength in the upgrades, both from starter-to-pro, but also from pro-to-enterprise in the quarter were really strong. And then we're additionally seeing real benefits from the multi-hub adoption in the customer base, as well as from some of the seat expansion that we're starting to see as our sales customers get bigger. So lots of good stuff going on on the retention side. As it relates to billings, like, as you know, billings is always a noisy metric. I think that we've consistently said we're not going to guide to billings, and we've tried to point you to really looking at billings growth as something that tracks revenue growth in constant currency. Q2 is going to be a strange quarter from a growth comparison. That's true for revenue. It's also going to be true for billings. In general, I would just expect that billings is going to largely track revenue with maybe a bit more volatility around FX and some product mix stuff.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Stan Zlotsky from Morgan Stanley. .\nStan Zlotsky: Perfect. Congratulations on a very strong quarter and wishing for a speedy recovery in return to Brian. A couple of questions from my end. I wanted to get Dharmesh involved because we don't get the term very often on call, so we're excited to have them on. On the operations hub, how are you thinking about when you guys were initially putting it together between balancing the low-code capabilities that are inherent in the product with the need to make the product really approachable to some of the smaller companies within your customer base given the fact that they do have limited developer resources?\nDharmesh Shah: First of all, thanks for your confidence. So operations hub is squarely in that kind of low code, no code category. And HubSpot's kind of driving passion has always been to take functionality that's historically been in kind of mega enterprises and democratize it and make it available for our kind of smaller and mid-market customers. So operations out, as an example, our data thinking engine allows you to say, okay, what this particular field in this system, the map of this field in this system, and here's how else I want to update it. And without writing any code, it lets you kind of express and declare what you want the outcome to be. And so that, I think, at the heart of what HubSpot is doing is to make these things that historically have been kind of hard to do or required dev teams to be able to have memorial operations experts that know the business be able to kind of model their business and run these automated processes without having to write a lot of code.\nStan Zlotsky: That's certainly really exciting, and I'm sure that's the reason why you're seeing some strong customer uptake just 10 days after launch. And maybe a quick follow-up for Kate. Going back to ASRPC. It was really encouraging to see that go up sequentially quarter-on-quarter, along with the fact that you guys put up record net adds in the quarter, which kind of suggests to me that you're seeing pretty strong momentum in the enterprise segment. What do you actually -- maybe qualitatively, what are you seeing up there in the upper end of the market? And how much of your revamp within the marketing hub and sales hub enterprise products is really driving the momentum that you're seeing there?\nKate Bueker: Stan, I'm going to let Yamini start that one, and maybe I will fill in any details that or she misses.\nYamini Rangan: Yes. Thanks a lot, Stan. Yes, I think you're right. I think we've powered our enterprise tier. And if you really take a step back, the enterprise tier over the past couple of years has gotten really, really strong. So as most of you know, marketing hub enterprise, we launched a year ago that went really well. It resonated with customers account-based marketing, revenue attribution reporting and AI-powered AB testing. That -- those are all like really powerful features that our customers have asked for, that's resonating really well. In terms of the sales hub, we launched that an inbound with custom objects. Now a lot of customers have been asking for customer objects for a while, and so that was obviously really a powerful new feature and then CPQ tools as well as sales acceleration tools. More recently in Q1, we added conversation intelligence. And that has also supercharged our sales hub enterprise. So a ton of momentum based on the investments we've been making in the product for a couple of years now. And then I would say, Stan, that in addition to it the go-to-market side is now in lock step with product as we optimize and fine-tune our approach to different segments. And we've always been really good, very well optimized in terms of the 20 to 200 employee space. And what we're doing right now is we're doubling down on the 200- to 2,000-employee segments. We're fine-tuning that approach. We are investing in sales enablement and sales process. And it's not necessarily that we're moving upmarket, but what we're doing is we are in the segment, and we are optimizing the segment to get higher percentage of wins. So in terms of the enterprise momentum, simple. Products got better, execution got better, well aligned and that puts us into the next year.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Mark Murphy from JPMorgan.\nMark Murphy: First, Brian, in case you're listening, I have enjoyed your haikus, and I've also enjoyed your playlist while you were recovering. So I wanted to just thank you for all the positive energy, and it's been quite an inspiration and that we're looking forward to catching up with you soon. Kate, I had a question for you. Are any of the current metrics running kind of clearly above trend where you can look at it and see that it's temporary. I mean, for example, I think we know you have an FX tailwind. There -- it's an easy comp. There's probably a tiny contribution from hustle, but is there anything else you would look at and say, for instance, retention, I think Alex was asking you about, retention or any other metrics that maybe you would just say that there are -- you can kind of tell they're running a little bit above trend temporarily?\nKate Bueker: It really feels like we're seeing a strength in the business that has some durability to it. I think you're calling out a couple of things that are relatively smaller that are temporary in FX and the sort of 1 quarter impact of some of the hustle ad revenue, but those are relatively small. The product is certainly sitting the current market need, and we're seeing very positive trends across the world.\nMark Murphy: Okay. Great. And then a quick one, I guess, for Dharmesh or Yamini. I've heard all the descriptions of what the Operations Hub is going to do. Just -- could you just clarify the product itself, is it a business rules or workflow engine? Is it like a data integration framework? Is it a ticketing system? Is it like a data quality fabric. Just anything that can help make that product a little more tangible to us.\nDharmesh Shah: Sure. I'll take this one. If you think about kind of three broad areas of functionality for which there are products in other categories, especially on the enterprise, and there's kind of data synchronization on how do you manage the data better and model it better. There's automation, how do I kind of do automated processes against that data and then there's reporting and intelligence. And what operations hub does overlap imagine that I were on the whiteboard, channeling Brian, drawing a venn diagram. Operations hub sits at the intersection of those three things, that says we want to get the data unified, we want to be able to automate the processes, and we want to be able to draw the data out in meaningful ways and be able to make intelligent business decisions. That's the kind of broad based.\nOperator: Your next question comes from DJ Hynes from Canaccord Genuity.\nDJ Hynes: Congrats on the stellar results, and I'll echo all the well wishes for Brian. I was hoping you could talk about the new pricing and packaging changes you've made with the CRM suite. I guess specifically, how much of the decision to move further in this direction was driven by learnings from the Starter Growth Suite pricing changes that I guess you made as part of your COVID relief measures last year versus maybe something else that you're seeing out there in the market?\nYamini Rangan: Thanks, DJ. I'll take this one. To step back, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, our goal is to be the number one CRM for scaling companies. And interestingly, as we looked at our pricing page and packaging base, we realized we actually didn't offer that, and we needed a bundling strategy that is very much aligned with our product vision and expanding footprint. And maybe just to recap, last year, we offered a growth suite and that's specific to marketing sales and service hubs. And we wanted something that our customers that are interested in adopting the broad HubSpot platform, it's easy for them to do so. And so the CRM suite not only includes the OG hubs, the marketing sales and service hubs but also includes the operations and CMS hub. And across the board, we're seeing more customers wanting to adopt a full suite of products, and we want to make it very easy for them to be able to buy it and leverage it and adopt it. And to your point, like what have we learned? I think last year, when we introduced the startup gold suite, one of the biggest lessons we learned was that simplicity drives velocity. So we're going to double down on simplicity across and I think we also want to make it very easy for our customers who want to digitize their front office, to buy and use our crafted beautiful solutions. So that's the whole intent.\nOperator: Your next question Brad Sills from BofA Securities.\nBrad Sills: And I'll echo the sentiment for Brian. We wish him well and hope a speedy recovery for Brian. I wanted to ask another kind of follow-up question, if you will, to the operations hub, please. I mean you can see a myriad of use cases here. It's applicable to sales, marketing, service, even CMS. Where do you see the most impact initially? And then perhaps over time, where in the stack, could you see operations hub provide that catalyst for perhaps, more heavier attach in kind of the core modules?\nYamini Rangan: Yes, Brad, thanks a lot for that question. If you think about the attach for operations hub, it's actually going to be across the board, right? I think the first thing is You're going to see it be part of our CRM bundle and add a lot of value in terms of driving data synchronization as well as workflows. And you're going to see it in a lot of the cross-sell opportunities. I mean a simple example where maybe you need to calculate the commissions and you rep closes a certain deal, and that's part of your sales hub. Now you can actually pull information about that deal, the product items, the custom objects from multiple data sources and be able to calculate commissions. And that's an example of how that can be an extension of sales hub. The same thing happens in terms of CMS and CRM. If you're powering that, you're going to be able to manual -- take some of the manual task to be able to automate it, whether you want to showcase certain things on your website, you can pretty easily automate it. So I think it's going to be across our sweet and expanding portfolio. It's just moving to fleet for power all of our suite. So we're pretty pumped about the initial reaction.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Arjun Bhatia from William Blair\nArjun Bhatia: Yes. Great quarter. Can you just talk about the progress that you've made with service hub over the last year? I know it's still relatively less mature than sales higher and marketing hub. But are you starting to see that service hub beginning to drive more net new business? Or is it still largely going to be attached to other hubs or part of the suite?\nDharmesh Shah: Yes. So service hub has been growing really well. It's actually further along in its kind of evolution sales hub was at a similar point in time. Having said that, right now, most of the sales are still part of the overall suite. We think over the course of the next 1 year, 1.5 years, 2 years that it will actually have it will be another door into the HubSpot platform. So we'll get independent sales service hub deals that draw new customers to the platform. We think the opportunity is certainly there is exciting and the path to get there is actually relatively clear for us. So we're excited about it.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Ryan MacDonald from Needham & Company.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thank you for the question. This is Alex on for Ryan. It seems like there's an increased level of focus momentum with sales hub in CRM, particularly in the mid and upper end of the target market. Are you seeing greenfield opportunities? Are you seeing improved win rates versus some legacy CRM platforms in the market?\nYamini Rangan: I think we're seeing pretty strong win rates across all of the segments, not just one segment across the board. And I would say that there's plenty of greenfield opportunity left. As we go into our customer base, there's still a ton of homegrown solutions, point solutions and sometimes even like spreadsheets that we are kind of replacing. And we step back, we've taken a very different approach to CRM. And as Brian would say it, we kind of like zag when others are zigging and we've taken a very different approach of crafting our solution. And that actually resonates with our customer base rather than maybe a cable together approach that might be okay for the larger portions of the segment. And within small and medium businesses, they don't want to pay the cobbling tax. They want simple consumer-like user interface with a scalable, powerful back end, and that's the approach that seems to be resonating really well. And as I talk to decision-makers and figure out the themes of why we are winning, it really comes down to a few things. First off, it's quick time to value. It takes a relatively short amount of time maybe in weeks to implement HubSpot and begin to get value. It doesn't take months or years. It is pretty easy to adopt. We've really focused on one of the hardest problems in CRM, which is adoption. And third, our pace of product innovation. Those are the reasons why we continue to win, and we're pretty happy with where we are in the landscape.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Terry Tillman from Truist Securities.\nTerry Tillman: Congrats on the great quarter, and I'll also say, I hope Brian makes it back soon. My question is going to relate to CMS hub. It's been about a year since the launch of CMS hub. Maybe you can talk about how the opportunity is evolving with CMS hub also hearing from your partners about success selling it alongside just the modern CRM. What makes it so special by combining the CMS with the CRM?\nDharmesh Shah: I love this question. So it's been about a year since the CMS hub launch. And if you look at the market on the lower end, there are lots of tools that I think of as kind of website publishing tools, and they're great products for that lower end of the market. There are a handful of tools on the mega enterprise side where if you have -- you're willing to spend thousands of dollars and hundreds of lives, you can solve some number of problems. In the middle, there's a HubSpot shaped hole in the market. And here's why I think it's important is that it's not just about delivering a website and publishing a website in some content, it's about creating a connected customer experience where the CMS actually talks the CRM. So I'll give you a quick example. So let's say you have your website up, you have customers and you want some portion of your website to only be visible to people that have bought a certain product and have also logged the support ticket in the last 60 days. Now that sounds like a relatively simple example, but to pull that off with the kind of classic CMS that's not connected to CRM, it would take a long time to take developer talent. In the case of HubSpot, that data is already in the CRM. We already have the automation tools. We have this support system all connected. And so exposing that and kind of implementing that particular use case and thousands like it is something mere mortals can do without requiring developer talent. And I think that's the kind of sweet spot for HubSpot is combine the CMS to CRM together, which has really never been done before.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Parker Lane from Stifel.\nParker Lane: Dharmesh you touched on it a little bit with the operations hub, but can you give us an update on the platform investments you're making? And what you think the strategy looks like on a 3- to 5-year basis? And I guess to that point, what opportunities you have for monetization across the ecosystem?\nDharmesh Shah: Sure. Absolutely. So what we're focused on right now is we're trying to be the number one CRM platform for scaling companies, and underlying the word platform there. What makes for a vibrant platform is we need a large pool of kind of developers and customers and partners kind of building and extending the functionality of HubSpot, that's the goal. So right now, what we're focused on is kind of enlarging that ecosystem and making it more vibrant. We're spending a fair amount of time in the same way that the HubSpot core product is the joy to use, we want the HubSpot platform to be a joint develop on and a joy to build on. And so although there are monetization opportunities even today, we want to be patient with that. We want to kind of grow that ecosystem. We want to fuel that particular flywheel as much as we possibly can and defer the monetization discussions for a later date. They're definitely out there and they're on our minds. But right now, the focus is just growing the ecosystem and delivering as much value as we can that developer community and building the ran there.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Chris Merwin from Goldman Sachs.\nChris Merwin: And let me offer my well wishes to Brian in his recovery. I wanted to ask one about operations hub as well. And specifically, is this a tool that ultimately is geared more towards your larger customers? It looks like the pricing of the website is for starter and pro. But I imagine this is something that, of course, your smaller customers as well as your larger customers could use for all sorts of different use cases. So just was hoping if you could talk a bit about the go-to-market strategy for growing this product? And where you see kind of the initial fit within the customer segments? And what that could look like over time as well?\nYamini Rangan: Yes. Chris, thank you so much for that question. I think it's actually going to be a fit for all segments that we are operating in small as well as mid-market customers. I think in the smaller end of our customer base, they are most likely not using anything, which is why this is such a feeling opportunity for us. And they still need to be able to get data across multiple systems. They still need to be able to automate multiple manual processes. And so I think it's going to be interesting there. And as you go a little bit upmarket into our mid-market segment, they currently may be using the few tools. Maybe they're using something like a Workato for business process automation or segment for connecting systems. And again, they're using for something -- they look for something simple, right? They want to be able to automate the processes and have something simple. And from a go-to-market perspective, we're going to focus it on first, the bundling opportunity as well as the cross-sell opportunity over a period of time that can develop into being a front door itself, but we really think it's going to start with our current installed base as well as bundle opportunity.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Ken Wong from Guggenheim Securities.\nKen Wong: Just one quick one for me. I realize it's a single data point with Q1 seeing customer adds jump up to 10,000 net. As we kind of look ahead with -- and also kind of factoring the fact that we're going to grow 40%, should we think about 10-K as the right number of net adds going forward now?\nKate Bueker: Ken, thanks for the question and for your optimism. We were -- as I said before, we were happy with the 9,900 net adds in the quarter. I think what we like is that we feel good about the fact that we have put that 3,000 to 4,000 new customer as the quarter behind us, and it really feels like we can sustain something that is higher than that, probably in more in that 7,000 to 9,000 range than what you're indicating.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Michael Turrin from Wells Fargo Securities. Michael Turrin, your line is open.\nMichael Turrin: I was hoping when you could go back to the retention strength for a moment and see if there's any color you can add on a few different factors. The discounting we saw last year and whether conversion rates you're seeing there are holding consistent, as well as the enterprise hubs and whether you're also holding on to customers longer. And maybe, Yamini, you can also talk more about what you're doing to improve productivity on the 200-plus segment. That comment was interesting.\nKate Bueker: Yes. Thanks, Michael. In terms of the impact of the customer plays that we ran last year, really in March, April and May, predominantly. You might remember that those plays were designed to be very short term in nature. And so the sort of renewal of those discount customers has happened for the most part in the back half of 2020. And so what we're seeing now is just a more normal course process for renewal at this point. So not a real impact on the retention statistic associated with those customers. In terms of your question around are customers sticking around with us? I think the general answer is yes. We have seen very strong customer dollar retention, which is the primary indicator of whether customers are really staying with HubSpot for a longer period of time. Q1 was yet another quarter where we had a record customer dollar retention.\nYamini Rangan: And yes, Michael, in terms of your question around the investments in sales productivity, that's really where we have doubled down over the last 18 months. We've always been in that segment. Now we're optimizing kind of investments we're making or a lot of training and enablement and ensuring that even in the remote world as new reps join, we are focusing on their time to ramp. We are focusing on the discipline within the sales process. And we're also making sure that when our reps work, they work with our customer success team that is talking to our customers every day as well as partners, we're talking to our customers every day. And so a lot of real nuts involved productivity improvement measures that we're investing in.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Michael Turits from KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nMichael Turits: Best to Brian, of course, and great quarter. I wanted to come back to where Brian Peterson started on macro. And I know you said that the demand continued from last half into this quarter. But has there been any shift in what customers want to invest in and do as we went from them just reacting to work from home last year to now we have worked from home plus back to the office and potentially a longer investment framework? So any changes we've moved into '21 and what they're doing?\nYamini Rangan: Yes. I can start on this one, and then I'll let Dharmesh or Kate chime in if there's other points. I'd say in terms of where our customers are focused on, their priorities presence, getting started with the digital presence that they do have a digital presence, making sure that the entire customer experience all the way from website marketing to sales is completely digitized. And a lot of the work that maybe needs to happen is kind of modernizing CRM. It's not -- the shift of going from just all kinds of marketing to digital marketing, the shift going to inside sales. The shift to having a very clean tech approach for customer service. That is the big shift and we see customers in all stages of maturity and they're kind of leaning in. That's where we see the prioritization as well as the demand.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Kirk Materne from Evercore ISI. .\nKirk Materne: Yes. Glad to hear Brian is doing well, and he's still very much in charge of the hold music before the earnings call. So I'm glad to hear his influence on that front. Maybe Yamini, could you talk a little bit more about the partnering opportunity. For a long time businesses that's focused on the SMB area didn't -- or midsized area didn't attract a whole lot of partners to that. There was just never enough work for them. It seems as you've expanded your product platform. You're now big enough, you have enough influence with your customers that the partners are coming in. And I was just kind of curious how that adds up to them influencing your pipeline, your close rates, obviously, you're landing with more multiproduct deals at the outset. So I was just wondering if you could add a little bit more color around how things are going on the partnering side.\nYamini Rangan: Yes. Thanks, Kirk. Brian, definitely controls a lot of our music interest here so it to continuem Yes in terms of our partners historically we have lot of smaller marketing agencies kind of services they are providing but partner channel is really diversifying kind of building on the expertise. As you heard me say in the opening remarks, the partner opportunity over the next two years is really huge, nearly $12 billion by 2024. And if you look at our product portfolio expanding, we would see there's tremendous opportunity for our partners to drive breadth of services to our customers, more integrations, more complex implementations and more breadth of services. And so this year, we've really focused our attention to our partner channel on a couple of different fronts. One, making sure that they're supporting in them in their diversification and building up their expertise because when they do really well, our customers get tremendous value. They engage with customers, they get so much value. So it's a win for customers, win for partners and win for HubSpot. And then we're also investing heavily to make sure that the direct team and the partner team are working well together. Traditionally, it's always been, hey, can you bring us in earlier when you're seeing the right kinds of opportunities. And our direct team is now engaged. They're bringing them in earlier. We're seeing a lot of traction. And when that happens, There's a lot of information sharing about what's right for the customer that happens between the direct team and the partner team. And so a lot of goodness in terms of how the partners are engaging with our customers as well as with internally.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Siti Panigrahi from Mizuho.\nMichael Berg: This is Michael Berg on for Citi. I wanted to say my congrats on a great quarter and some of my good wishes to Brian as well. I wanted to have one more follow-up on the Star Wars cohort that started in the pandemic last year. What sort of retention metrics, expansion metrics, how is that produced relative to prior cohorts? And now it's in a year out? And how can you see that moving forward?\nKate Bueker: Yes. As we've talked about over the last few earnings calls, we paid very close attention to those cohorts of starter growth suite customers on a variety of fronts. And in particular, we were looking at -- are we attracting the same or similar sized customers to our starter product? And the answer to that question as we had talked about is yes. Are they upgrading at similar rates or in line with expectations. The good news there was that the answer was yes. It continues to be a very strong tool for us in terms of net customer adds. This is the first couple of months where we see these big starter grocery cohorts come up a renewal. And the good news is that the renewal rates of these initial cohorts have been very healthy.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Derek Wood from Cowen & Company.\nAndrew Sherman: It's Andrew on for Derek. Congrats on the quarter and best to Brian. For Yamini, you've talked a lot on the call about investing in more in enterprise and sales productivity tools, but do you feel a need to build up more sales rep capacity and drive more revenue through a direct sales motion.\nYamini Rangan: Yes. It's balanced, right? You've got to do both. We have continued to higher across the different quarters, and we'll continue to focus on improving the productivity. And it's not just within our corporate segment, it is across all segments. We look at the 1,000 to 2,000 segment. And we have investments in the 1 to 20, where we are automating driving product-led growth where we have investments in the broader segment think of it as like multiple engines. And each of the engines are kind of getting optimized and fine-tuned and it includes hiring, but it also includes productivity-enhancing initiatives. So it's pretty balanced across both.\nOperator: That was our last question at this time. I will hand it back to Yamini Rangan, Chief Customer Officer, for any last comments.\nYamini Rangan: Well, thanks, everyone, for joining us on the call. I do hope that you\u2019re all safe and healthy. And we\u2019ll talk to you next quarter.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thanks, Chuck, and greetings, everyone. Thank you for joining us today as we review HubSpot's first quarter 2021 earnings results. Before we jump in, I'd like to give you a quick update on Brian. He's in good spirits and is well on his way to a full recovery. And while we're all looking forward to having him back, Yamini continues to lead day-to-day operations. Under her leadership, the team remains energized and well positioned to continue helping both HubSpot and our customers grow better. Now on to the results, which have been remarkable. As we round a full year of living and working in the midst of a pandemic, we've continued to see very strong growth across the business. Both revenue and customer growth accelerated from Q4. This has been driven in part by a significant demand for digital transformation. More and more companies are shifting to a digitally-powered, if not digital-first customer experience. It just so happens that we've been evangelizing this transformation since our founding nearly 15 years ago. As Brian said a few earnings calls ago, it feels like our vision matches the moment we're in. We've seen an acceleration in companies adapting to doing business online. This has made CRM not just important but indispensable. Digital first can't happen in 1 part of your customer journey and not another, and a strong comprehensive CRM platform is the thing that ties it all together. Our ambition is to become the number one CRM platform for scaling companies, and we're working towards that goal in two key ways: One, we're bringing high-end features only available to larger enterprises down to mid-market companies; and two, we're bringing a human friendly product and purchasing experience traditionally seen in small and mid-market businesses up to larger enterprises. HubSpot CRM platform is crafted in-house, not cobbled together with acquisitions. That's why it's powerful and easy to use instead of being clunky and expensive like many traditional enterprise platforms. This is at the heart of what makes HubSpot different. We're continuing to invest significantly in the platform and recently introduced the HubSpot CRM suite, which is designed to help our customers unlock the full power of our CRM platform. The CRM suite replaces the growth suite bundle and now includes CMS Hub and our new operations hub. This gives customers access to all of our starter, professional and enterprise products at a price point that delivers tremendous value. This is a win for our customers and moves us further towards being the number one CRM platform for scaling companies. I'm really excited about the progress we've made in the past year, but I'm even more excited about the path ahead. With 2021 already off to a strong start, we're in a great position to keep helping our customers create delightful end-to-end experiences for their customers and ultimately, grow better. With that, I'll hand it over to Yamini. Thanks, Kate. We're grateful to all of our customers and partners for their support, especially over the past year, the challenges of a global pandemic. It has impacted the lives and livelihoods of millions all over the world. Our hearts especially go out the people of India. They are fighting a humanitarian crisis with a sharp increase in the number of COVID cases. We wish all those impacted around the world brighter days ahead. I also want to extend my thanks to the HubSpot team. I'm so proud of the work they have done over the past year to help our customers and partners. HubSpot's 15 anniversary is coming up in a few weeks but it still feels like our business is in the early innings as we continue to pursue our mission of helping millions of organizations grow better. Thank you for your time. Operator, please open up the call for some questions. Thanks, Brian. Now for the well wishes. So Brian is doing well. He's in good humor. The team and I are in touch with them regularly. And we talk about things outside of just our favorite Netflix shows at the time. In terms of a date for the return, we don't have anything definitive mind. We have -- Brian is going to take the time that he needs to heal, and we look forward to having him back sometime later this year. I'll start off, and Yamini can chime in later. So when HubSpot looks at creating a new hub, we try to look for opportunities where the role in the persona that we're targeting is very well defined. And that those people have very well-defined pain points. In the case of operations hub, the people that we're focused on are sales ops, marketing ops and this kind of newly-emerging revenue ops role. So those are the people. And the three pain points are very distinct. Pain point number one is every mid-market company going through growth is using more and more applications within their infrastructure and having to deal with that kind of integration pain number two, is all of those teams have either inherent or implemented these kind of fragmented, disconnected data silos, so they're contending with that issue; and number three, there's so much that's happening within the organization. That's just manual, lots of manual work and kind of have to throw humans at the problem. So those are three kind of areas of pain. And what we want to do with operations hub, so if you think about kind of the evolution of that role, we kind of started off is [indiscernible] and they had their heads buried in the systems and fragmented data silos. It's gotten a little bit better. They've kind of lifted their heads up now, and they're more like Emus now. So they kind of look around, not quite there yet. What we want to do with operations hub is take them from Emus and elevate them to Eagles, where they have much more visibility, much more velocity. And so I'm very excited about the opportunity behind operations because things are not kind of problems that just a few customers have. Most of our customers have all three of these pain points. So I think the opportunity is big. I'll let Yamini on. First of all, thanks for your confidence. So operations hub is squarely in that kind of low code, no code category. And HubSpot's kind of driving passion has always been to take functionality that's historically been in kind of mega enterprises and democratize it and make it available for our kind of smaller and mid-market customers. So operations out, as an example, our data thinking engine allows you to say, okay, what this particular field in this system, the map of this field in this system, and here's how else I want to update it. And without writing any code, it lets you kind of express and declare what you want the outcome to be. And so that, I think, at the heart of what HubSpot is doing is to make these things that historically have been kind of hard to do or required dev teams to be able to have memorial operations experts that know the business be able to kind of model their business and run these automated processes without having to write a lot of code. Sure. I'll take this one. If you think about kind of three broad areas of functionality for which there are products in other categories, especially on the enterprise, and there's kind of data synchronization on how do you manage the data better and model it better. There's automation, how do I kind of do automated processes against that data and then there's reporting and intelligence. And what operations hub does overlap imagine that I were on the whiteboard, channeling Brian, drawing a venn diagram. Operations hub sits at the intersection of those three things, that says we want to get the data unified, we want to be able to automate the processes, and we want to be able to draw the data out in meaningful ways and be able to make intelligent business decisions. That's the kind of broad based. Yes. So service hub has been growing really well. It's actually further along in its kind of evolution sales hub was at a similar point in time. Having said that, right now, most of the sales are still part of the overall suite. We think over the course of the next 1 year, 1.5 years, 2 years that it will actually have it will be another door into the HubSpot platform. So we'll get independent sales service hub deals that draw new customers to the platform. We think the opportunity is certainly there is exciting and the path to get there is actually relatively clear for us. So we're excited about it. I love this question. So it's been about a year since the CMS hub launch. And if you look at the market on the lower end, there are lots of tools that I think of as kind of website publishing tools, and they're great products for that lower end of the market. There are a handful of tools on the mega enterprise side where if you have -- you're willing to spend thousands of dollars and hundreds of lives, you can solve some number of problems. In the middle, there's a HubSpot shaped hole in the market. And here's why I think it's important is that it's not just about delivering a website and publishing a website in some content, it's about creating a connected customer experience where the CMS actually talks the CRM. So I'll give you a quick example. So let's say you have your website up, you have customers and you want some portion of your website to only be visible to people that have bought a certain product and have also logged the support ticket in the last 60 days. Now that sounds like a relatively simple example, but to pull that off with the kind of classic CMS that's not connected to CRM, it would take a long time to take developer talent. In the case of HubSpot, that data is already in the CRM. We already have the automation tools. We have this support system all connected. And so exposing that and kind of implementing that particular use case and thousands like it is something mere mortals can do without requiring developer talent. And I think that's the kind of sweet spot for HubSpot is combine the CMS to CRM together, which has really never been done before. Sure. Absolutely. So what we're focused on right now is we're trying to be the number one CRM platform for scaling companies, and underlying the word platform there. What makes for a vibrant platform is we need a large pool of kind of developers and customers and partners kind of building and extending the functionality of HubSpot, that's the goal. So right now, what we're focused on is kind of enlarging that ecosystem and making it more vibrant. We're spending a fair amount of time in the same way that the HubSpot core product is the joy to use, we want the HubSpot platform to be a joint develop on and a joy to build on. And so although there are monetization opportunities even today, we want to be patient with that. We want to kind of grow that ecosystem. We want to fuel that particular flywheel as much as we possibly can and defer the monetization discussions for a later date. They're definitely out there and they're on our minds. But right now, the focus is just growing the ecosystem and delivering as much value as we can that developer community and building the ran there."

            "name": "Kate Bueker",
            "content": "Thanks, Yamini. Let's turn to our first quarter financial results and our guidance for the second quarter and full year of 2021. First quarter revenue grew 37% year-over-year in constant currency and 41% as reported. Q1 subscription revenue grew 41% year-over-year, while services and other revenue increased 43%, both on an as reported basis. If you exclude the impact of nonrecurring hustle revenue in the quarter, services and other revenue would have grown 33% in Q1. As Yamini indicated, we continue to see broad strength across all of our hubs, peers and geographies. Q1 revenue retention set another all-time high driven by record customer dollar retention and particular strength in addition upgrade and seat expansion activities. Customers continue to adopt HubSpot as a platform and over 55% of our customers are getting value out of two or more hubs today. Domestic revenue grew 33% in Q1, while international revenue growth was 42% year-over-year in constant currency and 51% as reported. International revenue represented 45% of total revenue in Q1, up 3 points year-over-year. We added a record 9,900 net customers in the quarter, bringing our total customer count to nearly 114,000, up 45% year-over-year. Average subscription revenue per customer of nearly 9,900 was up 1 point sequentially but down 1 point year-over-year. Deferred revenue as of the end of March was $339 million, a 40% increase year-over-year. Calculated billings was $304 million in Q1, growing 43% year-over-year in constant currency and 47% as reported. This acceleration in constant currency billings growth was driven by a very strong business performance in the quarter in addition to an easier overall comparison as a result of the challenging business environment in March of 2020. The remainder of my comments will refer to non-GAAP measures. First quarter gross margin was 81%, down slightly year-over-year. Subscription gross margin was 84%, while services gross margin was 8%. If you exclude the impact of nonrecurring hustle revenue and associated gross profit, services gross margin was near breakeven in the quarter, consistent with our long-term services margin target. First quarter operating margin was 7%, relatively flat as compared to the same period a year ago. The revenue overperformance in the quarter was largely offset by an increase in revenue-related costs, added expense from the hustle acquisition, as well as incremental R&D costs associated with investments in our application infrastructure. As I've discussed over the last couple of quarters, we plan to continue to invest aggressively across the business to meet the market demand we're seeing for our products and drive innovation to fuel long-term growth. At the end of the first quarter, we had 4,551 employees, up 27% year-over-year. Net income in the first quarter was $16 million or $0.31 per fully diluted share. CapEx, including capitalized software development costs, was $11 million or 4% of revenue in Q1. Free cash flow in the first quarter was $61 million or 22% of revenue. We continue to expect CapEx as a percentage of revenue to be about 5% in 2021, and now expect free cash flow to be between $155 million and $160 million, with another seasonally strong free cash flow quarter in Q4. Finally, our cash and marketable securities totaled $1.3 billion at the end of March. And with that, let's dive into guidance for the second quarter and full year of 2021. For the second quarter, total revenue is expected to be in the range of $293 million to $297 million, up 45% year-over-year at the midpoint. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be between $19 million and $21 million. Non-GAAP diluted net income per share is expected to be between $0.30 and $0.32. This assumes 50.9 million fully diluted shares outstanding. And for the full year of 2021, total revenue is now expected to be in the range of $1.237 billion to $1.247 billion, up 41% year-over-year at the midpoint. Non-GAAP operating income is now expected to be between $104 million and $106 million. Non-GAAP diluted net income per share is now expected to be between $1.61 and $1.65. This assumes 50.8 million fully diluted shares outstanding. As you adjust your models, keep in mind the following: At current spot rates, we're forecasting an FX tailwind to as reported revenue of 6 points in Q2 and still expect a 3-point tailwind for the full year. And with that, I'll hand things back over to Dharmesh for his closing remarks. Yes. Thanks, Samad, for noticing. We were certainly very happy with the 9,900 net customer additions in the quarter particularly combined with another quarter of sequential growth of ASRPC. The answer to your question is, frankly, it's a bit of both. Q1 was another quarter where we had a really balanced set of new customer additions across starter and professional and enterprise. And as you heard from Yamini in her prepared remarks, increasingly, we are seeing new customers in that professional enterprise come on as multiproduct customers, and we are also seeing ourselves landing bigger deals. So ASPs of new customers are healthy. We also both highlighted another record retention quarter in Q1, which certainly indicates a strong amount of upsell, which is another tailwind that we're seeing to ASRPC. So both of the things that you're highlighting are contributing to what trends we're seeing on those KPIs. Yes. Maybe I'll start with the retention question. Alex, thanks definitely good to see another really strong retention quarter. We set another record. I think as you've seen, we tend to share more detail around some of the KPIs at things like Analyst Day, and so that might be a good opportunity to reset with more specific expectations. What I will say is this. Customer dollar retention was, again, really the key foundation to the overall strength for retention in the quarter. Last year, we saw a dip in customer dollar retention that started in March, again, occurred in Q2. And then in the back half of the year, what we saw is a really pronounced pickup to customer dollar retention. And that strength really continued into Q1. It's frankly, what we're discovering is pretty simple. Our customers are actually using the product more. And as a result, they're retaining better. And then on top of the customer dollar retention, we are seeing really strong installed base selling across really a diverse set of drivers. In my prepared remarks, I called out a particular strength in the upgrades, both from starter-to-pro, but also from pro-to-enterprise in the quarter were really strong. And then we're additionally seeing real benefits from the multi-hub adoption in the customer base, as well as from some of the seat expansion that we're starting to see as our sales customers get bigger. So lots of good stuff going on on the retention side. As it relates to billings, like, as you know, billings is always a noisy metric. I think that we've consistently said we're not going to guide to billings, and we've tried to point you to really looking at billings growth as something that tracks revenue growth in constant currency. Q2 is going to be a strange quarter from a growth comparison. That's true for revenue. It's also going to be true for billings. In general, I would just expect that billings is going to largely track revenue with maybe a bit more volatility around FX and some product mix stuff. Stan, I'm going to let Yamini start that one, and maybe I will fill in any details that or she misses. It really feels like we're seeing a strength in the business that has some durability to it. I think you're calling out a couple of things that are relatively smaller that are temporary in FX and the sort of 1 quarter impact of some of the hustle ad revenue, but those are relatively small. The product is certainly sitting the current market need, and we're seeing very positive trends across the world. Ken, thanks for the question and for your optimism. We were -- as I said before, we were happy with the 9,900 net adds in the quarter. I think what we like is that we feel good about the fact that we have put that 3,000 to 4,000 new customer as the quarter behind us, and it really feels like we can sustain something that is higher than that, probably in more in that 7,000 to 9,000 range than what you're indicating. Yes. Thanks, Michael. In terms of the impact of the customer plays that we ran last year, really in March, April and May, predominantly. You might remember that those plays were designed to be very short term in nature. And so the sort of renewal of those discount customers has happened for the most part in the back half of 2020. And so what we're seeing now is just a more normal course process for renewal at this point. So not a real impact on the retention statistic associated with those customers. In terms of your question around are customers sticking around with us? I think the general answer is yes. We have seen very strong customer dollar retention, which is the primary indicator of whether customers are really staying with HubSpot for a longer period of time. Q1 was yet another quarter where we had a record customer dollar retention. Yes. As we've talked about over the last few earnings calls, we paid very close attention to those cohorts of starter growth suite customers on a variety of fronts. And in particular, we were looking at -- are we attracting the same or similar sized customers to our starter product? And the answer to that question as we had talked about is yes. Are they upgrading at similar rates or in line with expectations. The good news there was that the answer was yes. It continues to be a very strong tool for us in terms of net customer adds. This is the first couple of months where we see these big starter grocery cohorts come up a renewal. And the good news is that the renewal rates of these initial cohorts have been very healthy."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Yamini Rangan",
            "content": "Thanks so much, Dharmesh. Hey, everyone. I'm excited to share a business update and touch upon our go-to-market as well as our product innovation with you all. As you just heard, we've continued to see tremendous performance across the business with an acceleration of Q1 revenue growth to 37% year-over-year in constant currency and customer growth of 45% year-over-year. We set records in net new customer additions and revenue retentions in the quarter and are operating from a broad position of strength. Our products and geographies continued to perform well in Q1, but I want to focus on two particular areas of note in our go-to-market, segmentation and partner alignment. One of the key pillars of our go-to-market strategy is our customer segmentation approach. We want HubSpot to be easy to buy, easy to use and easy to love for the customer segments we serve and are optimizing how we sell to and support our customers. Historically, we've had great product and go-to-market fit in serving the needs of companies with 20 to 200 employees. Our goal is to expand the focus to drive increased efficiency in the 2- to 20-employee segment and improved sales productivity in the 200- to 2,000-employee segment. At the low end, we're investing in automation and product live growth, which frees up our sales team to focus on larger deals. And at the high end, we are investing in product and sales enablement to cater to the needs of larger companies. We are seeing strong customer additions as a result of the simplification and automation at the low end, balanced by strong ASP driven at the high end. These investments are translating into multi-hub deals, full platform deals and larger deals across the board. We're still in early days of implementing the strategy, but we feel really good about the traction we've seen thus far. Another key pillar of our go-to-market strategy is investing in our partner ecosystem. As we expand our platform, we're seeing the types of partners we have in our ecosystem continue to diversify. That diversification of our partners will drive growth for us as we work to serve the needs of scaling companies, and we are already starting to see that opportunity come to fruition. According to a new white paper from IDC, the HubSpot ecosystem made up of application and solution partners is forecasted to grow faster than HubSpot as the ecosystem revenue grows from nearly $5 billion in 2020 to over $12 billion in 2024. This represents a broad-based opportunity for HubSpot and our partners moving forward. Now I want to switch gears a little bit to talk about another important pillar of our business, our product. We recently expanded our suite of tools with the launch of Operations Hub. This new hub is designed to transform the role of operations professionals and empower them to become strategic drivers of revenue and growth. Through our research and in talking to customers, we've heard very clearly that operations professionals often have to do duplicative and reactive work. This is because they operate in functional silos and lack access to clean data and automated processes. Our operations teams have essentially become reactive firefighters. We want to help transform them into proactive and strategic friction fighters. Operations hub breaks down silos between functional business units and provides the foundation for revenue operations teams to work across a single source of truth. It helps our customers connect their tech stack, clean the data and automate their processes. It keeps them fast and flexible as they scale. And most importantly, it keeps their customer experience friction-free so they can run better to grow better. And as we've previously shared, HubSpot's growth will be driven by a balance of continued investment in our existing hubs, while also investing in new hubs to address our customers' adjacent front office needs. We know that revenue operations professionals are key decision makers for CRM. And with the launch of Operations Hub, we've expanded our offering to an entirely new persona while also making it easier than ever for companies to build their entire customer experience on the HubSpot CRM platform. In the first 10 days after the launch, more than 500 customers purchased operations hub. We're incredibly excited about the momentum we have seen from customers since launch. And the feedback we've heard from partners that far and feel strongly that operations hub will play an important part in HubSpot becoming the CRM platform of choice for scaling companies. With that, let me turn it over to Kate to walk through our financial results. Yes. Thanks a lot, Brian. I'll take the question. The demand environment is solid. We saw an improvement in the demand patterns in the last couple of quarters of last year, and we're pleased to see that sustained in here in Q1. So we're seeing continued tailwind. And I'd say, to your point on digital transformation, it's ongoing and it's certainly accelerating within our customer base as they're focused on lot of the digital-first efforts. We think we're still in the very early days in the arc of modern CRM, and we think our customers are going to continue to lean in there. I would say, in addition to that, our value proposition has got much stronger. Our TAM has gotten much bigger over the last few years as we've gone from marketing our company to a CRM platform. The product investments we've made are paying off, and we have an ideal platform to help small and mid-market companies digitize their front office. So our go-to-market is a lockstep with the product expansion and we're seeing very strong execution. So we feel really good about the way things are lining up. Yes, I completely agree with you, Dharmesh. I would say, Samad, in terms of how we're thinking about the opportunity, I think it's certainly a good way in which we will bundle this. As Dharmesh mentioned, operations hub really supercharges CRM. And so the first opportunity for us is to put it into our CRM suite, which is exactly what we have done. And operations hub, which brings together data crop system, so it's also going to make our CRM suite much more pickier. We also think there is an immediate cross-sell opportunity. We have a growing installed base of customers and the initial reaction from both our customers as well as partners has been really positive, and we think both small as well as mid-market customers are going to really adopt and drive the solution. And on the addressable opportunity, I don't think there's like a number we've been to, but I do think it's a very large multibillion opportunity to consider marketing operations not only opens up the traditional $15 billion PR market, but also data analysis and integration. So we're kind of very excited about how incremental this opportunity is and how this opens it up for us. Yes. Thanks a lot, Alex, for the question. I'll take this. We are really happy with the momentum that we saw, and it's kind of broad-based across all of the geographies. U.S. is large. It's seen growth. We really like the results there and went from 27% to 33% growth. At the same time, all of our international theaters did really well. The flywheel is spinning across all of these and then if you take a step back, we are still very much in early innings and early kind of market penetration, most of the markets that they're operating in and our TAM is really large. The value proposition is strong and resonating across these markets. Unit economics is pretty strong. The cost to acquire customer relative to lifetime value is really solid in these international markets, and so we have continued to invest. And so we're really pleased with the balanced performance that we saw across all of the geos. Yes. Thanks a lot, Stan. Yes, I think you're right. I think we've powered our enterprise tier. And if you really take a step back, the enterprise tier over the past couple of years has gotten really, really strong. So as most of you know, marketing hub enterprise, we launched a year ago that went really well. It resonated with customers account-based marketing, revenue attribution reporting and AI-powered AB testing. That -- those are all like really powerful features that our customers have asked for, that's resonating really well. In terms of the sales hub, we launched that an inbound with custom objects. Now a lot of customers have been asking for customer objects for a while, and so that was obviously really a powerful new feature and then CPQ tools as well as sales acceleration tools. More recently in Q1, we added conversation intelligence. And that has also supercharged our sales hub enterprise. So a ton of momentum based on the investments we've been making in the product for a couple of years now. And then I would say, Stan, that in addition to it the go-to-market side is now in lock step with product as we optimize and fine-tune our approach to different segments. And we've always been really good, very well optimized in terms of the 20 to 200 employee space. And what we're doing right now is we're doubling down on the 200- to 2,000-employee segments. We're fine-tuning that approach. We are investing in sales enablement and sales process. And it's not necessarily that we're moving upmarket, but what we're doing is we are in the segment, and we are optimizing the segment to get higher percentage of wins. So in terms of the enterprise momentum, simple. Products got better, execution got better, well aligned and that puts us into the next year. Thanks, DJ. I'll take this one. To step back, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, our goal is to be the number one CRM for scaling companies. And interestingly, as we looked at our pricing page and packaging base, we realized we actually didn't offer that, and we needed a bundling strategy that is very much aligned with our product vision and expanding footprint. And maybe just to recap, last year, we offered a growth suite and that's specific to marketing sales and service hubs. And we wanted something that our customers that are interested in adopting the broad HubSpot platform, it's easy for them to do so. And so the CRM suite not only includes the OG hubs, the marketing sales and service hubs but also includes the operations and CMS hub. And across the board, we're seeing more customers wanting to adopt a full suite of products, and we want to make it very easy for them to be able to buy it and leverage it and adopt it. And to your point, like what have we learned? I think last year, when we introduced the startup gold suite, one of the biggest lessons we learned was that simplicity drives velocity. So we're going to double down on simplicity across and I think we also want to make it very easy for our customers who want to digitize their front office, to buy and use our crafted beautiful solutions. So that's the whole intent. Yes, Brad, thanks a lot for that question. If you think about the attach for operations hub, it's actually going to be across the board, right? I think the first thing is You're going to see it be part of our CRM bundle and add a lot of value in terms of driving data synchronization as well as workflows. And you're going to see it in a lot of the cross-sell opportunities. I mean a simple example where maybe you need to calculate the commissions and you rep closes a certain deal, and that's part of your sales hub. Now you can actually pull information about that deal, the product items, the custom objects from multiple data sources and be able to calculate commissions. And that's an example of how that can be an extension of sales hub. The same thing happens in terms of CMS and CRM. If you're powering that, you're going to be able to manual -- take some of the manual task to be able to automate it, whether you want to showcase certain things on your website, you can pretty easily automate it. So I think it's going to be across our sweet and expanding portfolio. It's just moving to fleet for power all of our suite. So we're pretty pumped about the initial reaction. I think we're seeing pretty strong win rates across all of the segments, not just one segment across the board. And I would say that there's plenty of greenfield opportunity left. As we go into our customer base, there's still a ton of homegrown solutions, point solutions and sometimes even like spreadsheets that we are kind of replacing. And we step back, we've taken a very different approach to CRM. And as Brian would say it, we kind of like zag when others are zigging and we've taken a very different approach of crafting our solution. And that actually resonates with our customer base rather than maybe a cable together approach that might be okay for the larger portions of the segment. And within small and medium businesses, they don't want to pay the cobbling tax. They want simple consumer-like user interface with a scalable, powerful back end, and that's the approach that seems to be resonating really well. And as I talk to decision-makers and figure out the themes of why we are winning, it really comes down to a few things. First off, it's quick time to value. It takes a relatively short amount of time maybe in weeks to implement HubSpot and begin to get value. It doesn't take months or years. It is pretty easy to adopt. We've really focused on one of the hardest problems in CRM, which is adoption. And third, our pace of product innovation. Those are the reasons why we continue to win, and we're pretty happy with where we are in the landscape. Yes. Chris, thank you so much for that question. I think it's actually going to be a fit for all segments that we are operating in small as well as mid-market customers. I think in the smaller end of our customer base, they are most likely not using anything, which is why this is such a feeling opportunity for us. And they still need to be able to get data across multiple systems. They still need to be able to automate multiple manual processes. And so I think it's going to be interesting there. And as you go a little bit upmarket into our mid-market segment, they currently may be using the few tools. Maybe they're using something like a Workato for business process automation or segment for connecting systems. And again, they're using for something -- they look for something simple, right? They want to be able to automate the processes and have something simple. And from a go-to-market perspective, we're going to focus it on first, the bundling opportunity as well as the cross-sell opportunity over a period of time that can develop into being a front door itself, but we really think it's going to start with our current installed base as well as bundle opportunity. And yes, Michael, in terms of your question around the investments in sales productivity, that's really where we have doubled down over the last 18 months. We've always been in that segment. Now we're optimizing kind of investments we're making or a lot of training and enablement and ensuring that even in the remote world as new reps join, we are focusing on their time to ramp. We are focusing on the discipline within the sales process. And we're also making sure that when our reps work, they work with our customer success team that is talking to our customers every day as well as partners, we're talking to our customers every day. And so a lot of real nuts involved productivity improvement measures that we're investing in. Yes. I can start on this one, and then I'll let Dharmesh or Kate chime in if there's other points. I'd say in terms of where our customers are focused on, their priorities presence, getting started with the digital presence that they do have a digital presence, making sure that the entire customer experience all the way from website marketing to sales is completely digitized. And a lot of the work that maybe needs to happen is kind of modernizing CRM. It's not -- the shift of going from just all kinds of marketing to digital marketing, the shift going to inside sales. The shift to having a very clean tech approach for customer service. That is the big shift and we see customers in all stages of maturity and they're kind of leaning in. That's where we see the prioritization as well as the demand. Yes. Thanks, Kirk. Brian, definitely controls a lot of our music interest here so it to continuem Yes in terms of our partners historically we have lot of smaller marketing agencies kind of services they are providing but partner channel is really diversifying kind of building on the expertise. As you heard me say in the opening remarks, the partner opportunity over the next two years is really huge, nearly $12 billion by 2024. And if you look at our product portfolio expanding, we would see there's tremendous opportunity for our partners to drive breadth of services to our customers, more integrations, more complex implementations and more breadth of services. And so this year, we've really focused our attention to our partner channel on a couple of different fronts. One, making sure that they're supporting in them in their diversification and building up their expertise because when they do really well, our customers get tremendous value. They engage with customers, they get so much value. So it's a win for customers, win for partners and win for HubSpot. And then we're also investing heavily to make sure that the direct team and the partner team are working well together. Traditionally, it's always been, hey, can you bring us in earlier when you're seeing the right kinds of opportunities. And our direct team is now engaged. They're bringing them in earlier. We're seeing a lot of traction. And when that happens, There's a lot of information sharing about what's right for the customer that happens between the direct team and the partner team. And so a lot of goodness in terms of how the partners are engaging with our customers as well as with internally. Yes. It's balanced, right? You've got to do both. We have continued to higher across the different quarters, and we'll continue to focus on improving the productivity. And it's not just within our corporate segment, it is across all segments. We look at the 1,000 to 2,000 segment. And we have investments in the 1 to 20, where we are automating driving product-led growth where we have investments in the broader segment think of it as like multiple engines. And each of the engines are kind of getting optimized and fine-tuned and it includes hiring, but it also includes productivity-enhancing initiatives. So it's pretty balanced across both. Well, thanks, everyone, for joining us on the call. I do hope that you're all safe and healthy. And we'll talk to you next quarter."

Now it\u2019s my pleasure to turn over the call to HubSpot\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, Yamini Rangan. Yamini?\nYamini Rangan: Thank you, Chuck, and welcome to everyone joining us on the call. Today, I want to focus on our Q4 results, reflect on 2022 and share our strategy for driving profitable growth going forward. Before we get started, I want to acknowledge the restructuring announcement we just made two weeks ago, where we decided to part ways with approximately 500 HubSpotters. This was the most difficult decision in HubSpot\u2019s history and not one we took lightly, but one we believe is in the best interest of the company over the long-term. I will talk further about the rationale and the impact in a few minutes. Now on to our results. Q4 revenue grew 35% year-over-year in constant currency and full year 2022 revenue grew 39% in constant currency. Our operating profit margin was 14% in Q4 and 10% for the full year. Total customers grew 24% to over 167,000 globally. Our bimodal strategy is clearly working. We saw strong net customer adds of 8,400 in Q4 driven by a strong quarter of free CRM sign-ups, CMS Hub Free, which continues to open up our distribution channels, and the Starter Suite, which is delivering more value through better automation. At the same time, we also have momentum upmarket where we are delivering clear value for larger customers. In fact, large deals were the fastest growing area of our business in Q4. These results demonstrate that HubSpot\u2019s connected, easy-to-use, powerful platform is mission critical for our customers. In terms of the demand environment, I talked in November about what we are seeing with customers, including longer deal cycles, more decision makers and increased budget scrutiny. While these trends and macro pressures persisted throughout Q4, they did not get materially worse. We continue to navigate this environment by demonstrating the value HubSpot can deliver and we are increasingly becoming the platform of choice. We saw more multi-hub deals with the mix shifting even more to three and five hub deals. I am pleased with how we continue to solve for the customer with product innovation, while executing against our strategic priorities throughout 2022. Now reflecting on 2022, it truly was a roller-coaster of a year. Much like our peers, we experienced a perfect storm of uncertain macro, tighter customer budgets and longer decision making cycles. As I talk to our customers, a few shifts are increasingly clear. SMBs are doubling down on digital. Their businesses are now built on digital compared to pre-pandemic. They are not turning back. But instead of operating in a buy first, understand value later mode, they are now in a understand value deeply by cautiously mode. HubSpot has always resonated with customers because we deliver easy-to-buy, easy-to-use and easy-to-manage solutions. Now in this environment, we are focused on helping our customers drive innovation and efficiency with a quick time to value with customers taking under eight weeks on average to activate and see value. Throughout 2022, we had two key areas of focus; maintaining our fast pace of product innovation while driving consistent results. On the product side, innovation was just cranking. We relaunched Service Hub, added CMS Hub Free and launched hundreds of new enhancements to meet our customer\u2019s evolving needs. Three areas I want to highlight; we drove more omni-channel execution with launches like our WhatsApp integration; more intelligence and insights with customer journey analytics and Campaigns 2.0; and more connected commerce with payment subjects, recurring ACH and payment schedules. It was a record year of innovation capped off by being rated by G2 as the number one global software company in 2023 and the number one product in both Marketing and Sales. Just awesome recognition and a strong testament to the progress we are making on driving innovation. Also, I am happy to announce that we are promoting Andy Pitre to lead our product organization as EVP of Product and User Experience. Andy has had an incredible influence on our product over the past 13 years at HubSpot. He is one of the very early product leaders who drove the CRM platform vision, was the brain behind Operations Hub and is exceptionally customer-centric. Andy will be filling the role formerly held by Steph Cuthbertson, who made a personal decision to step down as Chief Product Officer at the end of 2022. I want to thank Steph for her contributions to HubSpot and wish her the very best. In terms of go-to-market execution, as customer behavior shifted in 2022, we adopted. We leaned more heavily into total cost of ownership and got even better at communicating the tremendous value of HubSpot. We did more team selling and delivered clear messaging to the multiple buyers and personas that are now part of the buying process. In short, we stepped up to the challenge, executed well and helped our customers navigate choppy waters. Now let\u2019s shift gears to 2023. Our continued focus is on driving profitable growth, maintaining agility and executing efficiently. I am confident in our ability to normally navigate uncertain times but also to emerge stronger. Here are some of the decisions we have made to help drive long-term profitable growth. First, in January, we announced plans to reduce our workforce by 7% and consolidate our facilities. We made this decision to thoughtfully align our people and resources to strategic business needs. We are also optimizing our real estate portfolio to better align with the needs of our hybrid workforce. These changes will help us drive profitable growth and enable us to invest more in innovation that solves for our customers long into the future. We are also taking steps to drive more efficiency over the long-term. Specifically, we are looking at multiple areas within sales and marketing. On the direct sales side, we are investing in systems and automation to improve rep productivity internally. We are continuing our journey on product-led growth, both to scale the low end of our business with Starter and to drive demand for Pro and Enterprise in a more efficient manner. On the partner side, we are making important changes to our commission structure to align partner incentives with customer value. We are leaning into better reward partners who source demand, who co-sell alongside us and engage deeply with our customers. These are multiyear initiatives and will lead to a more efficient direct, product led and partner sales motions that set us up for profitable growth and margin expansion. I want to wrap up by sharing our strategic objectives for 2023. While the environment may be uncertain, we operate in massive markets and are confidently pursuing our goal of becoming the number one CRM platform for scaling companies. Our first objective is to become the SMB market share leader in marketing, sales and service. We are laser-focused on these three mega markets and we will enable more upmarket customers to adopt HubSpot with easier customization, greater extensibility and better governance capabilities. We will help our customers drive revenue through improved customer journeys and greater rep effectiveness. And we will lean into omni-channel by expanding channels to serve the changing needs of our customers. Our next objective is to continue on our journey to transform B2B commerce. We launched HubSpot Payments a little over a year ago and early customer interest have been strong despite the macro environment. This year, as we continue to ramp, we will be focused on driving greater awareness of our commerce capabilities and increase customer adoption, while adding key functionality like native invoices, flexible billing and flexible payment processing that our customers need. Third, we will double down on our bimodal strategy. Our strategy of focusing on volume of customer adds at the low end, while expanding the value of customers at the upper end is working. We launched CMS Free, introduced self-guided demos, moved automation down to our Starter edition and optimized sign-ups. These initiatives drove results, and we added over 30,000 net new customers last year, with the majority landing on the Starter CRM Suite and expanding beyond. We will continue to find creative ways to make it even easier for customers to get started with HubSpot and get value out of our platform quickly. Our final objective is to build a high performing, sustainable and equitable company. We are focused on foundational investments that can help us scale better. That includes better coaching and development for top talent, better performance culture, better systems and better hybrid connection. We know when we invest in our employees\u2019 growth we will drive better outcomes for our customers and for HubSpot. We have a clear opportunity ahead to drive value for our customers and we have the right strategy in place to drive profitable growth. With that, I will hand it over to our CFO, Kate Bueker, to take you through our financial and operating results.\nKate Bueker: Thanks, Yamini. Let\u2019s turn to our Q4 and full year 2022 financial results. Fourth quarter revenue grew 35% year-over-year in constant currency and 27% on an as-reported basis. Q4 subscription revenue grew 28% year-over-year, while services and other revenue increased 8% on an as-reported basis. Full year 2022 revenue grew 39% year-over-year in constant currency and 33% as reported. Full year subscription revenue grew 34% year-over-year, while services and other revenue decreased 5%, again both on an as-reported basis. Domestic revenue grew 31% year-over-year in Q4, while international revenue growth was 38% in constant currency and 23% as reported. International revenue represented 45% of total revenue in Q4. We added over 8,400 net new customers in the quarter, bringing our total customer count to 167,000, up 24% year-over-year. Starter CRM Suite continued to fuel our strong net adds again in Q4. Average subscription revenue per customer grew 9% year-over-year in constant currency and 3% on an as-reported basis to $11,200. The primary driver of this strength continues to be the adoption of multiple hubs by professional and enterprise customers. We maintained a healthy gross retention rate in the high 80s in Q4 as customers continue to view HubSpot\u2019s platform as mission-critical. Net revenue retention was 107% in Q4, down 2 points sequentially, driven by continued customer optimization of HubSpot spend. As I have mentioned in the last few quarters, we continue to expect net revenue retention to remain pressured as a result of the challenging macro environment. Deferred revenue as of the end of December was $546 million, a 25% increase year-over-year. Calculated billings were $542 million in Q4, growing 29% year-over-year in constant currency and 26% as reported. The remainder of my comments will refer to non-GAAP measures, except by comments relating to restructuring charges. Q4 gross margin was 84%, up 2 points year-over-year. Subscription gross margin was 86% in Q4, while services and other gross margin was negative 14%. Full year gross margin was 83%, again up 2 points year-over-year. Subscription gross margin was 85%, while services and other gross margin was negative 29%. Q4 operating margin was 14% and full year operating margin was 10%, both up compared to 2021. Q4 operating margin benefited from the impact of slower hiring and reduced discretionary spending that we implemented in the second half of 2022. Net income in Q4 was $57 million or $1.11 per fully diluted share. At the end of the fourth quarter, we had approximately 7,400 employees, up 26% year-over-year and up slightly sequentially. This does not include our recent workforce reduction of approximately 500 employees. CapEx, including capitalized software development costs was $19 million or 4% of revenue in Q4 and $82 million or 5% of revenue for the full year. Free cash flow in the quarter was $71 million or 15% of revenue and $191 million or 11% of revenue for the full year. Finally, our cash and marketable securities totaled $1.5 billion at the end of December. Now before I dive into guidance, I wanted to provide a bit more context regarding our recent restructuring. As Yamini indicated, this wasn\u2019t a decision we made lightly, but it is one that we believe will better align our people with our strategic needs and help position HubSpot as a more efficient and agile company. Our headcount reductions allow us to continue to invest against a number of strategic business needs, including product innovation and systems and automation to scale better in a hybrid world. We are also taking steps to optimize our real estate portfolio to better serve our hybrid employee base by consolidating leases, including our Davenport headquarters building in Cambridge. As we outlined in the 8-K filing a few weeks ago, we expect to incur charges in a range of $72 million to $105 million in connection with the restructuring. We expect the majority of employee severance costs to be incurred in the first quarter, while the lease consolidation costs are expected to be incurred throughout 2023. These charges and related cash expenditures will be excluded from our non-GAAP operating profit, operating cash flow and free cash flow results. And with that, let\u2019s review our guidance for the first quarter and full year of 2023. As we have discussed, the macro environment remains challenging. The customer behavior we are seeing today is very similar to Q4, tighter budgets, deals taking longer to close and more people involved in the approval process. Our guidance assumes that these weaker macroeconomic conditions persist throughout 2023. For the first quarter, total as-reported revenue is expected to be in the range of $473 million to $475 million, up 20% year-over-year at the midpoint. We expect foreign exchange to be a 4-point headwind to as-reported revenue growth in the first quarter. Non-GAAP operating profit is expected to be between $45 million and $47 million. We expect foreign exchange to be a 1-point headwind to operating profit margin in the first quarter. Non-GAAP diluted net income per share is expected to be between $0.82 and $0.84. This assumes 51.5 million fully diluted shares outstanding. And for the full year of 2023, total as-reported revenue is expected to be in the range of $2.05 billion to $2.06 billion, up 19% year-over-year at the midpoint or 20% in constant currency, including a foreign exchange headwind of 1-point for the full year. Non-GAAP operating profit is expected to be between $248 million and $252 million. We now expect foreign exchange to be a slight headwind to as-reported operating profit margin for the full year of 2023. Non-GAAP diluted net income per share is expected to be between $4.24 and $4.32. This assumes 52.2 million fully diluted shares outstanding. As you adjust your models, keep in mind the following. Most of the operating margin increase we expect from our restructuring will be realized in Q2 through Q4 of 2023 and is included in our guidance. We expect non-GAAP operating profit margin to be between 9% and 10% in the first and second quarters, low-double digits in the third quarter and high-teens in the fourth quarter. We expect CapEx as a percentage of revenue to be roughly 5% and free cash flow to be about $225 million for the full year of 2023 with seasonally stronger free cash flow in Q1 and Q4. And with that, I will hand things back over to Yamini for her closing remarks.\nYamini Rangan: Thank you so much, Kate. As I look ahead, we have a clear long-term vision to become the number one CRM platform for scaling companies and a focused strategy in 2023 to make progress on that vision. Our customers continue to depend on HubSpot and we are more motivated than ever to help them grow. We also have a clear strategy to drive profitable growth long-term and thoughtful changes we are making to build a more efficient company. All of this makes me confident in HubSpot\u2019s future. I want to thank our employees for their adaptability and continued focus on solving for our customers. I want to thank our customers, our partners and our shareholders for your support. With that, Operator, let\u2019s open up the call for questions.\nOperator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Samad Samana of Jefferies. Please proceed.\nSamad Samana: The initial FY 2023 guidance is also very healthy considering the macro environment. How should we think about what -- yeah?\nChuck MacGlashing: Yeah. Sorry, we didn\u2019t hear the first part of -- yeah, we missed the first part of that. Could you maybe start over for us? Thanks.\nSamad Samana: Yeah. Sorry. Yeah. Sorry, I was saying that, it was an impressive 2022 under tough circumstances and the initial 2023 guidance is also very healthy considering the macro environment. How should we think about what\u2019s considered in the guidance when we compare it to your comments in the recent shareholder letter, the letter to employees about potentially tougher times ahead and does it factor in the impact from the areas that will be deemphasized following the layoff?\nYamini Rangan: Hey, Samad. Thanks a lot for your question. So maybe -- this is Yamini. Maybe I will start with the strategic rationale for the layoff and then give a little bit of color in terms of demand and then Kate can answer the question on guidance. In terms of the layoff, this was the most difficult decision we had to make in HubSpot\u2019s history and something that we did not take lightly. And if we step back, this is not simply a short-term cost-cutting decision. This was a strategic realignment of our people and investments so we can drive long-term profitable growth. And there are two reasons why we got to this decision. The first is that we had areas within the business where headcount had grown faster than revenue, areas like recruiting and services, and even when we consider 2023 growth, we had that excess capacity. So we wanted to ensure that our people and our resources are clearly aligned to the growth in 2023 and our strategy in 2023. The second rationale is that we want to invest thoughtfully in key areas of the business to drive profitable growth over the next decade. We want to invest in product innovation so we can drive customer outcomes and emerge stronger from the cycle. We want to invest internally in our own systems and automation wherever we find there are manual processes so we can be even more efficient and innovative as a company. So those were the two reasons why we got to this difficult decision. Now you mentioned the employee letter and the comment that we have made in terms of the demand environment. Look, demand environment in Q4 remained very consistent with what we shared in Q3. We saw deal cycles lengthening. We saw more decision-makers involved. We saw more scrutiny of deals and budgets before approvals. Q4 did not get better, but it did not get materially worse and so what we have assumed is that the demand environment will remain challenging going into 2023.\nKate Bueker: Yeah. And Samad, I will just follow-up with Yamini\u2019s comments around how we thought about guidance. The baseline assumption in our 2023 guidance is consistent with Yamini\u2019s description of the environment, which is, it stays difficult, but it remains very consistent with what we saw throughout Q3. It doesn\u2019t get materially better and it doesn\u2019t get materially worse. Now that said, as you know, we always try to set guidance that contemplates a variety of outcomes and we did the same thing this time. And so we feel good about our guidance with that set of base case assumptions, but we also feel good about that guidance even if the external environment gets a little bit worse from here.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy of JPMorgan. Please proceed.\nMark Murphy: Yeah. Thank you very much and I will echo my congrats on the ability to navigate this environment out there. I am wondering, if perhaps in any pockets, you might have noticed any change in the buyer behavior in the last three months or four months. Basically since we started to see some of the cooler CPI inflation data, I am just curious if that development might be sporadically loosening up some conversations. I know you are saying the environment was just as tough overall in Q4, but do you think anything could be changing on the margin as we head into the spring and summer or do you think that, that will take more time?\nYamini Rangan: Yeah. Mark, this is Yamini. Thanks a lot for your question. And look, I think, overall, the demand environment has remained consistent. It\u2019s not gotten better and it\u2019s not gotten materially worse. As we looked at our pipeline, now our pipelines tend to be just current quarter, next quarter, there are a couple of things that we are seeing at the margin, right? Short-cycle deals, ones that are typically created in month and closed in months and they tend to be in the lower end of our segments are continuing to maintain velocity. So we see reasonable velocity there. Longer-cycle deals that typically tend to be upmarket are taking just a little longer to close, and again, this is because of more decision-makers involved, more kind of caution in terms of looking at the budget. And so that\u2019s the maybe minor change or shift that I would say in terms of the types of deals. Now if I look at pipeline, I have been talking to customers a lot more in Q3, Q4 and going into Q1, there are few kinds of characteristics of what we see within the pipeline, customers care a lot about time to value. The number one question that I get, we get, is how quickly can we migrate, what is the value and how quickly am I going to get there and HubSpot is resonating because we can deliver value in a matter of weeks, not months. The second thing that we are seeing is people care about driving productivity and a tight alignment between marketing and sales. This is the year where driving clear productivity across marketing and sales and getting much better visibility on the customer\u2019s matter and so we begin to see that in the pipeline. And then, finally, eliminating point solutions and driving down costs, a lot of conversations on platform consolidation and with a view towards cost savings, that\u2019s what we are seeing. It\u2019s a high bar for action amongst customers. That high bar remains. But I am really pleased with how the team is focused on executing in this environment.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Brent Bracelin of Piper Sandler. Please proceed.\nBrent Bracelin: Thank you and good afternoon. I wanted to follow up on the large customer cohort. This sounds like it\u2019s the fastest growing part of the business. We have seen an appetite to consolidate vendors, which really spiked up in our survey ahead of the year. Enterprises seem to be more than willing to consolidate vendors more than ever. Have you seen a change relative to the size of the large customers wanting to consolidate on the HubSpot? I ask because it does feel like you are getting pulled into the Enterprise. So can you just refresh us on your ambition to move upmarket versus staying in the core mid-market swim lane?\nYamini Rangan: Yeah. Thanks a lot for the question. Look, we remain very focused. Our segmentation and the segment that we care about deeply is 200 to 2,000 employees. That\u2019s the segmentation that we care about. Within that, the 200 to 2,000 segment is what we consider upmarket customers. And as I mentioned, we certainly saw momentum and a lot more larger deals in Q4 and we are continuing to see that now. I think if you step back and think about these larger customers, they are expecting a lot more out of their marketing and sales spend this year. They want more leads. They want better visibility of pipeline. They want better rep effectiveness, and as you think about this, HubSpot delivers that. We are a connected marketing sales and front-office solution and our hubs are clearly delivering value, which is why we see that. The second thing that you mentioned is also around platform consolidation. One of the key priorities this year is to look at the Sales Stack and the Martech Stack and look at ways of eliminating point solutions to drive cost savings and in all of those considerations, HubSpot is becoming the platform of choice. Now that\u2019s certainly because of the product momentum we have, it\u2019s because our go-to-market has adapted with our partners to be able to drive value for these upmarket customers and we are really proud of the work that the entire organization is doing in terms of where we are in the market.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Terry Tillman of Truist. Please proceed.\nTerry Tillman: Yeah. Thanks for taking my question and congrats from me as well in terms of the strong execution. Yamini, I had a question related to partners. I mean funders over time, I mean, some of these partners have grown up with you all and scaled up as you all scaled up and they have become pretty big themselves. But I am curious if we can get an update on partner influence or percentage of the businesses from partners? And if you could just unpack a little bit about it, it sounds like there\u2019s some changes or evolution with partners. But maybe you can just help us a little bit more on kind of what\u2019s instigating that and what kind of outcomes or benefits come out of the work you are doing there incrementally with partners? Thank you.\nYamini Rangan: Yeah. Absolutely. Happy to take that, Terry. Look, our partner strategy is working, and a few years ago, we went to our partner ecosystem and we said, look, we are transitioning to marketing automation to CRM platform and our vision is to scale selling and servicing with export partners. That is working and our partner influenced MRR or ARR is about 45% compared to the overall. So it\u2019s a good split between direct and partner-influenced MRR. We have momentum. We are co-selling much better over the last three years and partners are behind us. Now I did mention that we are making a structural change to the commission. If we step back, our partner commission was initially set up when HubSpot had one hub and just a couple of additions. This is like 10 years ago. And then as you all know, over the last couple of years, we have expanded our product portfolio. We have added Operations Hub, we have added CMS Hub and we have added more additions to the hub. So as we step back and we looked at our partner commission strategy, we want to incentivize our partners who are now coming along this journey with us to do a couple of things. We want them to first be deeply engaged with customers. When partners get involved with customers, it leads to better close rates and it leads to better retention and we want to drive that. And second, we want to be enabled to incentivize them on driving more multi-hub, as well as co-sells. And so we just announced, I just came from the partner kickoff today, as well as yesterday, where we announced a few changes to the commission structure, which again, incentivizes them to have deeper connection with our customers. And I have been talking to a number of our top partners over the past few weeks in terms of this change they get it, they understand that we are evolving to a multi-hub company and they understand that we are going to continue to invest within the ecosystem. So, overall, excited by the change, as well as the evolution of the partner strategy.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Gabriela Borges of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.\nGabriela Borges: Good afternoon. Thank you. Questions for Kate on the net retention number. Give us a little bit of a sense on how much exposure you have to growing and scaling customers in the technology vertical, specifically looking to understand what\u2019s going on with the shift from hiring in the technology vertical to perhaps being more of a headwind and do you think 107% will be the trough for 2023 and that was a question? Thank you.\nKate Bueker: Yeah. A couple of questions in there, Gabriela, but let me give it a shot. I mean just maybe start with the facts, which is I shared in the prepared remarks that our net revenue retention in the fourth quarter was 107%, which was down a little bit from Q3, but really very much in line with the expectations that we shared in Q3. And I think you know, there\u2019s really two big components of net revenue retention. One is the gross retention or what we call customer dollar and that\u2019s really hung in there very resiliently in that high 80s. The other piece is the net upgrade rate and that includes a number of motions, some of that you are talking about, which are seat upgrades, contact tier upgrades, edition upgrades, some cross-selling. And it\u2019s really that net upgrade motion that has been challenged in the economic environment as customers are both slowing the rate at which they are upgrading, but also have a bit of a sharper eye on their overall spend with HubSpot. And so we are seeing pressure both on the upgrade side and also on the downgrade side. And in the near-term, we expect that, that pressure will remain. We actually think that net revenue retention is likely to tick down again in Q1. But we feel really good about our ability to hold net revenue retention above 100%. Over the longer term, we continue to believe that we can deliver net revenue retention of 110% in any healthier macro environment.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Rishi Jaluria of RBC. Please proceed.\nRishi Jaluria: Oh! Wonderful. Thanks so much for taking my question. It\u2019s nice to see continued resilience in the business model. Yamini, I wanted to dig a little bit more into some of the momentum you are seeing with Service Hub post-relaunch. What has kind of been the momentum you have seen so far? And really, importantly, when you think about the feedback that you have gotten from customers so far. Are there any other kind of enterprise-grade features or functionality that need to be developed further in order to be more competitive against some of the incumbents like the likes of Zendesk or is that something that\u2019s already happening? Thank you.\nYamini Rangan: Hey, Rishi. Thanks a lot for the question. Look, we are very excited about Service Hub. Last year was a pretty big year. We did relaunch and there were a number of features that move the needle in terms of Service Hub and we see that in the momentum in terms of the go-to-market. Now I mentioned in the prepared remarks a little bit about multi-hub momentum, a lot more three, as well as five hub deals and customer wins that we are seeing and part of that is the strength of Service Hub. And we are going to continue to focus on it, it\u2019s one of our strategic objectives in 2023 is to go deep in terms of leadership in Marketing Hub, Sales Hub and Service Hub. And we are evolving to support workspace, we are going to be driving even more omni-channel service through improved calling functionality, knowledge base, SMS. The recent WhatsApp launch in Q4, that was a pretty big win and we got a lot of positive feedback from our customers and we are pretty excited to share more there. As we do these things, we step back and listen, are we getting more multi-hub customers, are we delivering more value and when the customers begin to use it, are we driving improved customer satisfaction. And for each of those questions in Service Hub, the answer is, yes. So we are pleased with it, and it will continue to be a strategic objective this year to drive thought leadership within Service Hub.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Alex Zukin of Wolfe Research. Please proceed.\nAlex Zukin: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question and congrats obviously on a solid quarter. I guess, if we think about the shape of the growth curve for 2023 versus 2022 from the standpoint of customer adds versus ASRPC, how has it changed given some of the momentum upmarket that you are seeing? Where -- would you expect it to be similar, slightly different? And then, I guess, just to clarify the comment on net revenue retention, expect to keep it over 100% in the short term but return to potentially 110%. How -- what\u2019s -- meaning when does that trough, like if you were to think about from a quarterly basis? Is that -- is there comp that you would get past where this activity started, meaning like as of 3Q of this year where you start to see that rebound or help us there a little bit?\nKate Bueker: Yeah. Thank you. I will try to hit all of your questions. I will do my very best. Let me just start with the revenue retention question. The short answer is, like, I wish I knew. To me it\u2019s very much tied to your view of the macroeconomic environment. And I think -- when I think about the areas of pressure on the net upgrade rate, they are very much tied to the external environment, and as we start to see that like solidify and recover, I think that\u2019s when you will start to see net revenue retention recover. I will then try to address your KPI question around ASRPC and net adds. I think you astutely noticed that things are shifting a little bit here. This is now our second quarter of really strong net customer adds at the low end. We are seeing really nice sign-ups of our free CRM, we are seeing the free CMS really resonate and it\u2019s that sort of sign-up volume converting into our Starter tier that is driving a real strength in net customer adds. Now like -- as you know, there\u2019s push and pull across ASRPC and net customer adds when it\u2019s being fueled by that low end of our bimodal. And what you saw in Q4 is after a period of real strength at the Enterprise that drove ASRPC up in the double digits in constant currency pretty consistently, we dipped below 10% in ASRPC growth. And that pressure that we are seeing from the success at the low end is going to continue into 2023 and we expect that ASRPC growth in 2023 is going to look more like low-to-mid single digits.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Arjun Bhatia of William Blair. Please proceed. My apologies. The next question comes from Michael Turits of Key Capital. Please proceed.\nMichael Turits: Yeah. Thanks. Yeah. Thanks. Congrats on everything, especially on the margins. So maybe I will take that margin as a topic -- as an extension to Alex\u2019s question where you went with that, Kate. To the extent that you are more focused on adds as opposed to ASRPC as a driver, how does that impact the balancing act with margin expansion to the extent that you should be getting a lot of easy -- relatively easy leverage out of ASRPC growth, arguably less so out of cost of adds?\nKate Bueker: Yeah. I guess, maybe I will just start by answering your foundational comment, which is, like focusing on adds versus focusing on ASRPC. These are output metrics and I think we have talked about this in the past, like our goal is consistently to drive topline growth in ARR over time, not to drive growth in one or the other of ASRPC or new customer adds. And when you see us consistently investing in that bimodal strategy, there\u2019s going to naturally be some periods of time where we have more expansion in ASRPC and more expansion in other times in net customer adds, and probably, that\u2019s just as the balance of new versus installed base sort of moves around. The other question you had was around leverage and I am glad you asked. We provided guidance for this year that reflects our ongoing commitment to balancing growth and profitability. We delivered nice results in Q4 at a full year of 10% operating profit margin and our guide implies another 2, excuse me, 250 basis points of margin improvement. Over time, we have the financial framework that shows and demonstrates our balance between growth and profitability and we continue to remain committed to delivering against that.\nYamini Rangan: Yeah. I think like Kate hit on all of the points there. The one thing I would say is, as we think about this mid- to long-term and especially as we think about our sales and marketing efficiency, look, we have product led growth, it\u2019s sales rep growth and partner led growth, and all of these are the input engines that then result in our net adds as well as ASRPC. And as we think about each of these three things; product led growth, we are driving more and more initiatives so we can get efficient; sales led growth, we are driving more automation, more systems, more investments so we can make our reps even more productive; and partner led growth, we talked about some of the changes that we are structurally making so that we can become even more efficient. And so as we think about how we balance growth and profitability, we have short-term initiatives and then we have medium-term initiatives and we are really committed to balancing both growth and profitability.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Brian Peterson of Raymond James. Please proceed.\nBrian Peterson: Hi. Thanks for taking the question and I will echo congrats on the strong quarter. I\u2019d love to understand on the multi-hub adoption and the success you are having there. Is that more a function of the landing with more hubs and higher attach rates on Starter tiers or where we have seen a lot of success on cross-sell as well, there\u2019s a lot of time kind of spend on the net down sell. But I\u2019d love to understand what the cross-sell motion has looked like for net new in the existing base, because I think that\u2019s obviously got a secular perspective there?\nYamini Rangan: Yeah. I think that\u2019s a great question. Look, I think, we are seeing both multi-hub lands, as well as strong cross-sells. And let me step back and maybe look at this from the customer perspective. As we talk to customers, a couple of things are becoming very clear. As they think about 2023, it is a lot about driving sales and marketing alignment. The handoff between marketing and sales has all has been tricky. Whose pipeline are you getting and is this good quality of pipeline? So if you think about customers, they want more needs, they want better campaign effectiveness, they want more activity tracking and they want all of this to line up to growth from a sales perspective. And therefore, in our conversations, we see that there are more multi-hub starting points, more starting points with Marketing and Sales and Operations Hub, for example, in the initial sale. So that\u2019s happening within new land. And then, similarly, what we see is when our customer has adopted, for example, Marketing or Sales and they see the value proposition of HubSpot, which is easy-to-use, easy-to-manage, driving adoption, then it becomes an easier conversation to have a cross-sell dialogue with the VP of Sales or the VP of Service. And so we do find that in the first year of HubSpot purchase, customers have a high propensity to kind of look at additional hubs and get the visibility across customer base. And so the combination of both of those lead to very healthy three-hub, as well as five-hub wins from a customer perspective.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Brad Sills of Bank of America. Please proceed.\nBrad Sills: Oh! Great. I will add my congratulations on a real nice finish to the year in a tough environment. Maybe if you could drill in a little bit on that same topic there, Yamini, where are you seeing these three and five-hub deals where there\u2019s incremental strength across the stack? I mean Sales and Marketing, obviously, the core. It sounds like Service Hub is strong, CMS, would love to get some color there and anything on Payments? So just any incremental strength across the stack and these larger multi-hub deals?\nYamini Rangan: Yeah. Thanks a lot, Brad. Look, I think, if you look at our performance in Q4, we are very pleased, because it shows strength in upmarket, it shows strength in multi-hub and it shows strength in our low end adds of Starter Suite. And this is our bimodal strategy. Our bimodal strategy is we want to add volume of customers at the lower end and as they scale and as they see value within HubSpot, they continue to upgrade to Pro and Enterprise tiers and get even more value from HubSpot and that bimodal strategy working. And in terms of which product areas are we seeing strength, certainly, Marketing and Sales are core front doors and we are very pleased to see Sales Hub become a legitimate front door. A lot more conversations on tying Sales and Marketing and that\u2019s an area that we have talked about. And when they buy Sales and Marketing and they want to deeply integrate and connect with other systems within the organization, Ops Hub comes in. And Ops Hub, we have talked about how it drives value from an integration perspective and providing and building on that reporting and then Service Hub. So across all of our core hubs, we are seeing pretty good momentum. In terms of commerce, now that\u2019s a longer term bet. We are pleased with the levels of merchant activation, as well as the transactions. It\u2019s early, early stages, and there\u2019s just a lot more to go, and as I look at our strategy this year, it\u2019s super clear. We want to go deep in Marketing, Sales and Service, and we want to continue to maintain the momentum that we have in commerce and we want to do both of those by focusing on the bimodal strategy, which is working. I hope that gives you a little bit more color, Brad.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Josh Reilly of Needham & Company. Please proceed.\nJosh Reilly: Hey, there. Thanks for taking my question. One of the interesting points I thought highlighted at the Analyst Day last year was the large mix of Starter customers as a percent of total paying customers, which potentially is creating the kind of pent-up demand to migrate to Pro and Enterprise when the market recovers. How would you characterize the magnitude of the mix of customers postponing upgrades due to the macro today versus prior slowdowns? And is there a point in time where these customers need to migrate regardless of the macro or what have you seen in past cycles? Thank you.\nKate Bueker: Yeah. It\u2019s an interesting question. Thanks for that. We do feel like the momentum in the Starter customer adds is a great long-term strategy for us. In terms of what we are seeing today around Starter upgrades, the newer cohorts that have started with us are actually upgrading at pretty healthy rates. We took a number of actions last year to solve for the customer to really drive that volume that we are seeing at the lower end. We talked about things like bringing marketing automation down, introducing a free CMS and we continue to experiment around pricing and packaging. All of that has resulted in like a nice expansion of the number of Starter customers that are joining us. But at the same time, we watch those cohorts really closely to make sure that their usage and their upgrade patterns are consistent and healthy and they are pretty consistent with what we have seen in the past.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Keith Bachman of BMO. Please proceed.\nAdam Holt: Hi. This is Adam on for Keith. First, thank you for taking my questions. I wanted to dig a little deeper into the 2023 revenue guidance. So I hear your comments on Payments being relatively early still. But I think you previously commented that you expect contributions to growth next year for Payments and then I know we have ongoing contribution from the margin kind of enterprise price hike. So I was wondering if we could parse out the benefits to each of those for next year? Thank you.\nKate Bueker: Yeah. Thanks so much for the question. You are hitting on all of the details here. I would just say Payments, as we -- I will reiterate Yamini\u2019s comments. Payments is early, we are investing for the long term in Payments. As I shared with -- at Analyst Day, it is not going to be a material contributor to our growth or profitability in 2023. On the Marketing Hub Enterprise price change, we continue to hear positive feedback on the change. Again, it is not a material driver of the results in 2023.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Elizabeth Porter of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.\nElizabeth Porter: Great. Thanks so much. Yeah. You talked a lot about deals taking longer and more scrutiny, which we are clearly hearing across the broader landscape. I was curious on what you are seeing just at the top of funnel and how the pipeline is shaping up and anything we should look for outside of just macro factors to help us convert that faster in the medium to near-term? I know you highlighted investments around sales and partners, are these more tailwinds that are after 2023? Thank you.\nYamini Rangan: Yeah. Elizabeth, great question. Look, it\u2019s very interesting. When we talk to customers, two things are happening at the same time. SMBs are deeply committed to digital and it\u2019s -- there was a question about whether SMBs are going to thrive during the pandemic. There\u2019s a question about whether SMBs are going to survive this downturn. But what we find is that SMBs are committed to digital. They are continuing to build their businesses on digital. They are continuing to leverage digital solutions to be able to stay in touch with their customers. And I hear this in over and over in my conversations with customers and we see this within the pipeline. Now at the same time, what we have been talking about is that, they want to understand value deeply, they want to buy a little bit more cautiously and that translates into longer deal cycles. I think we, like everybody else, we are going to continue to monitor and continue to look at leading indicators as we go and how does that change our dynamic and how we have adapted our execution? I think a few things based on what we are seeing. We are leading with value. Every conversation is about value, about delivering quick time to value, as well as the cost savings that our customers can see in terms of consolidating on the platform. And our sales teams, as well as the partner organizations are enabled to have these conversations and our value proposition really resonates. So for us the go-to-market has really adopted. And from a product perspective, we are in a place of strength. You just heard us talk about G2. In G2, we have been rated as number one in Marketing, number one in Sales. And we have become a platform of choice for mid-market companies and scaling companies that are looking at options, whether they are driving productivity or they are driving cost savings, we are in those conversations. So I feel even given the macro conditions, the combination of our product innovation, as well as go-to-market execution positions us really strongly. And then, overall, as we all expect me, at some point, this cycle, the economic cycle is going to turn. And so part of the focus in terms of the leadership team is, how do we make strong and thoughtful decisions right now to position ourselves to emerge stronger when the cycle turns. So that\u2019s how we think about this year and then beyond.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Michael Turrin of Wells Fargo. Please proceed.\nMichael Berg: Hi. This is Michael Berg on from Michael Turrin. Congrats on a great quarter. I wanted to double click on the margin seasonality you laid out on your -- earlier in the call. When I am thinking about the back half of this year, is there any benefits from the real estate consolidation that\u2019s baked into that number or are those benefits expected to be seen beyond 2023?\nKate Bueker: So there is -- thank you for the question. There -- the benefits of the restructuring will accrue to the business in Q3 and Q4. As you know, we tend to have seasonally stronger back half margins anyway. There is some amount of real estate benefit in the back half of the year and the benefit from the workforce reduction is spread pretty evenly across those quarters.\nOperator: Thank you. And our final question will come from the line of Arjun Bhatia of William Blair. Please proceed.\nArjun Bhatia: Perfect. Thank you guys for taking the question. Yamini, maybe one for you, just going back to the restructuring a little bit. I am curious if there is any impact to the product roadmap to the launch of new hubs as a result of the restructuring or if this was purely focused on maybe more support type roles, how should we see that impact playing out?\nYamini Rangan: Yeah. Good question, Arjun. Just to kind of share some perspective of how we thought about this. We have mentioned this a couple of times, this was not short-term costing decision. This was a strategic realignment of our investment so that we can drive long-term innovation, as well as scalability within the organization. So as we step back, we look across the company on how best to align our people, resources to our strategy so that we can emerge stronger from this economic cycle. And the fact is we have teams with excess capacity like recruiting and services and those were the areas that we pulled back aggressively. We also looked at areas where there was duplicate work and opportunities for us to be much more efficient. Now throughout the process, we were very careful about protecting product innovation, as well as direct quota carrying roles. And in fact, as we have said a couple of times, we are reinvesting in areas of product, as well as internally so that we can drive scalability. So we feel very good in terms of our strategic objectives and ability to continue to fuel the pace of innovation that we have had.\nOperator: Thank you. And with that, we will conclude our question-and-answer session for today\u2019s call. I would now like to pass the conference over to the management team for closing remarks.\nYamini Rangan: Thank you so much everybody. We really appreciate your support. A huge thanks to HubSpot employees, customers, partners for their resilience as they have navigated all of these times. Look forward to talking to you all next quarter.\nOperator: And with that, we will conclude today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect your line.",

            "name": "Kate Bueker",
            "content": "Thanks, Yamini. Let's turn to our Q4 and full year 2022 financial results. Fourth quarter revenue grew 35% year-over-year in constant currency and 27% on an as-reported basis. Q4 subscription revenue grew 28% year-over-year, while services and other revenue increased 8% on an as-reported basis. Full year 2022 revenue grew 39% year-over-year in constant currency and 33% as reported. Full year subscription revenue grew 34% year-over-year, while services and other revenue decreased 5%, again both on an as-reported basis. Domestic revenue grew 31% year-over-year in Q4, while international revenue growth was 38% in constant currency and 23% as reported. International revenue represented 45% of total revenue in Q4. We added over 8,400 net new customers in the quarter, bringing our total customer count to 167,000, up 24% year-over-year. Starter CRM Suite continued to fuel our strong net adds again in Q4. Average subscription revenue per customer grew 9% year-over-year in constant currency and 3% on an as-reported basis to $11,200. The primary driver of this strength continues to be the adoption of multiple hubs by professional and enterprise customers. We maintained a healthy gross retention rate in the high 80s in Q4 as customers continue to view HubSpot's platform as mission-critical. Net revenue retention was 107% in Q4, down 2 points sequentially, driven by continued customer optimization of HubSpot spend. As I have mentioned in the last few quarters, we continue to expect net revenue retention to remain pressured as a result of the challenging macro environment. Deferred revenue as of the end of December was $546 million, a 25% increase year-over-year. Calculated billings were $542 million in Q4, growing 29% year-over-year in constant currency and 26% as reported. The remainder of my comments will refer to non-GAAP measures, except by comments relating to restructuring charges. Q4 gross margin was 84%, up 2 points year-over-year. Subscription gross margin was 86% in Q4, while services and other gross margin was negative 14%. Full year gross margin was 83%, again up 2 points year-over-year. Subscription gross margin was 85%, while services and other gross margin was negative 29%. Q4 operating margin was 14% and full year operating margin was 10%, both up compared to 2021. Q4 operating margin benefited from the impact of slower hiring and reduced discretionary spending that we implemented in the second half of 2022. Net income in Q4 was $57 million or $1.11 per fully diluted share. At the end of the fourth quarter, we had approximately 7,400 employees, up 26% year-over-year and up slightly sequentially. This does not include our recent workforce reduction of approximately 500 employees. CapEx, including capitalized software development costs was $19 million or 4% of revenue in Q4 and $82 million or 5% of revenue for the full year. Free cash flow in the quarter was $71 million or 15% of revenue and $191 million or 11% of revenue for the full year. Finally, our cash and marketable securities totaled $1.5 billion at the end of December. Now before I dive into guidance, I wanted to provide a bit more context regarding our recent restructuring. As Yamini indicated, this wasn't a decision we made lightly, but it is one that we believe will better align our people with our strategic needs and help position HubSpot as a more efficient and agile company. Our headcount reductions allow us to continue to invest against a number of strategic business needs, including product innovation and systems and automation to scale better in a hybrid world. We are also taking steps to optimize our real estate portfolio to better serve our hybrid employee base by consolidating leases, including our Davenport headquarters building in Cambridge. As we outlined in the 8-K filing a few weeks ago, we expect to incur charges in a range of $72 million to $105 million in connection with the restructuring. We expect the majority of employee severance costs to be incurred in the first quarter, while the lease consolidation costs are expected to be incurred throughout 2023. These charges and related cash expenditures will be excluded from our non-GAAP operating profit, operating cash flow and free cash flow results. And with that, let's review our guidance for the first quarter and full year of 2023. As we have discussed, the macro environment remains challenging. The customer behavior we are seeing today is very similar to Q4, tighter budgets, deals taking longer to close and more people involved in the approval process. Our guidance assumes that these weaker macroeconomic conditions persist throughout 2023. For the first quarter, total as-reported revenue is expected to be in the range of $473 million to $475 million, up 20% year-over-year at the midpoint. We expect foreign exchange to be a 4-point headwind to as-reported revenue growth in the first quarter. Non-GAAP operating profit is expected to be between $45 million and $47 million. We expect foreign exchange to be a 1-point headwind to operating profit margin in the first quarter. Non-GAAP diluted net income per share is expected to be between $0.82 and $0.84. This assumes 51.5 million fully diluted shares outstanding. And for the full year of 2023, total as-reported revenue is expected to be in the range of $2.05 billion to $2.06 billion, up 19% year-over-year at the midpoint or 20% in constant currency, including a foreign exchange headwind of 1-point for the full year. Non-GAAP operating profit is expected to be between $248 million and $252 million. We now expect foreign exchange to be a slight headwind to as-reported operating profit margin for the full year of 2023. Non-GAAP diluted net income per share is expected to be between $4.24 and $4.32. This assumes 52.2 million fully diluted shares outstanding. As you adjust your models, keep in mind the following. Most of the operating margin increase we expect from our restructuring will be realized in Q2 through Q4 of 2023 and is included in our guidance. We expect non-GAAP operating profit margin to be between 9% and 10% in the first and second quarters, low-double digits in the third quarter and high-teens in the fourth quarter. We expect CapEx as a percentage of revenue to be roughly 5% and free cash flow to be about $225 million for the full year of 2023 with seasonally stronger free cash flow in Q1 and Q4. And with that, I will hand things back over to Yamini for her closing remarks. Yeah. And Samad, I will just follow-up with Yamini's comments around how we thought about guidance. The baseline assumption in our 2023 guidance is consistent with Yamini's description of the environment, which is, it stays difficult, but it remains very consistent with what we saw throughout Q3. It doesn't get materially better and it doesn't get materially worse. Now that said, as you know, we always try to set guidance that contemplates a variety of outcomes and we did the same thing this time. And so we feel good about our guidance with that set of base case assumptions, but we also feel good about that guidance even if the external environment gets a little bit worse from here. Yeah. A couple of questions in there, Gabriela, but let me give it a shot. I mean just maybe start with the facts, which is I shared in the prepared remarks that our net revenue retention in the fourth quarter was 107%, which was down a little bit from Q3, but really very much in line with the expectations that we shared in Q3. And I think you know, there's really two big components of net revenue retention. One is the gross retention or what we call customer dollar and that's really hung in there very resiliently in that high 80s. The other piece is the net upgrade rate and that includes a number of motions, some of that you are talking about, which are seat upgrades, contact tier upgrades, edition upgrades, some cross-selling. And it's really that net upgrade motion that has been challenged in the economic environment as customers are both slowing the rate at which they are upgrading, but also have a bit of a sharper eye on their overall spend with HubSpot. And so we are seeing pressure both on the upgrade side and also on the downgrade side. And in the near-term, we expect that, that pressure will remain. We actually think that net revenue retention is likely to tick down again in Q1. But we feel really good about our ability to hold net revenue retention above 100%. Over the longer term, we continue to believe that we can deliver net revenue retention of 110% in any healthier macro environment. Yeah. Thank you. I will try to hit all of your questions. I will do my very best. Let me just start with the revenue retention question. The short answer is, like, I wish I knew. To me it's very much tied to your view of the macroeconomic environment. And I think -- when I think about the areas of pressure on the net upgrade rate, they are very much tied to the external environment, and as we start to see that like solidify and recover, I think that's when you will start to see net revenue retention recover. I will then try to address your KPI question around ASRPC and net adds. I think you astutely noticed that things are shifting a little bit here. This is now our second quarter of really strong net customer adds at the low end. We are seeing really nice sign-ups of our free CRM, we are seeing the free CMS really resonate and it's that sort of sign-up volume converting into our Starter tier that is driving a real strength in net customer adds. Now like -- as you know, there's push and pull across ASRPC and net customer adds when it's being fueled by that low end of our bimodal. And what you saw in Q4 is after a period of real strength at the Enterprise that drove ASRPC up in the double digits in constant currency pretty consistently, we dipped below 10% in ASRPC growth. And that pressure that we are seeing from the success at the low end is going to continue into 2023 and we expect that ASRPC growth in 2023 is going to look more like low-to-mid single digits. Yeah. I guess, maybe I will just start by answering your foundational comment, which is, like focusing on adds versus focusing on ASRPC. These are output metrics and I think we have talked about this in the past, like our goal is consistently to drive topline growth in ARR over time, not to drive growth in one or the other of ASRPC or new customer adds. And when you see us consistently investing in that bimodal strategy, there's going to naturally be some periods of time where we have more expansion in ASRPC and more expansion in other times in net customer adds, and probably, that's just as the balance of new versus installed base sort of moves around. The other question you had was around leverage and I am glad you asked. We provided guidance for this year that reflects our ongoing commitment to balancing growth and profitability. We delivered nice results in Q4 at a full year of 10% operating profit margin and our guide implies another 2, excuse me, 250 basis points of margin improvement. Over time, we have the financial framework that shows and demonstrates our balance between growth and profitability and we continue to remain committed to delivering against that. Yeah. It's an interesting question. Thanks for that. We do feel like the momentum in the Starter customer adds is a great long-term strategy for us. In terms of what we are seeing today around Starter upgrades, the newer cohorts that have started with us are actually upgrading at pretty healthy rates. We took a number of actions last year to solve for the customer to really drive that volume that we are seeing at the lower end. We talked about things like bringing marketing automation down, introducing a free CMS and we continue to experiment around pricing and packaging. All of that has resulted in like a nice expansion of the number of Starter customers that are joining us. But at the same time, we watch those cohorts really closely to make sure that their usage and their upgrade patterns are consistent and healthy and they are pretty consistent with what we have seen in the past. Yeah. Thanks so much for the question. You are hitting on all of the details here. I would just say Payments, as we -- I will reiterate Yamini's comments. Payments is early, we are investing for the long term in Payments. As I shared with -- at Analyst Day, it is not going to be a material contributor to our growth or profitability in 2023. On the Marketing Hub Enterprise price change, we continue to hear positive feedback on the change. Again, it is not a material driver of the results in 2023. So there is -- thank you for the question. There -- the benefits of the restructuring will accrue to the business in Q3 and Q4. As you know, we tend to have seasonally stronger back half margins anyway. There is some amount of real estate benefit in the back half of the year and the benefit from the workforce reduction is spread pretty evenly across those quarters."

            "name": "Yamini Rangan",
            "content": "Thank you, Chuck, and welcome to everyone joining us on the call. Today, I want to focus on our Q4 results, reflect on 2022 and share our strategy for driving profitable growth going forward. Before we get started, I want to acknowledge the restructuring announcement we just made two weeks ago, where we decided to part ways with approximately 500 HubSpotters. This was the most difficult decision in HubSpot's history and not one we took lightly, but one we believe is in the best interest of the company over the long-term. I will talk further about the rationale and the impact in a few minutes. Now on to our results. Q4 revenue grew 35% year-over-year in constant currency and full year 2022 revenue grew 39% in constant currency. Our operating profit margin was 14% in Q4 and 10% for the full year. Total customers grew 24% to over 167,000 globally. Our bimodal strategy is clearly working. We saw strong net customer adds of 8,400 in Q4 driven by a strong quarter of free CRM sign-ups, CMS Hub Free, which continues to open up our distribution channels, and the Starter Suite, which is delivering more value through better automation. At the same time, we also have momentum upmarket where we are delivering clear value for larger customers. In fact, large deals were the fastest growing area of our business in Q4. These results demonstrate that HubSpot's connected, easy-to-use, powerful platform is mission critical for our customers. In terms of the demand environment, I talked in November about what we are seeing with customers, including longer deal cycles, more decision makers and increased budget scrutiny. While these trends and macro pressures persisted throughout Q4, they did not get materially worse. We continue to navigate this environment by demonstrating the value HubSpot can deliver and we are increasingly becoming the platform of choice. We saw more multi-hub deals with the mix shifting even more to three and five hub deals. I am pleased with how we continue to solve for the customer with product innovation, while executing against our strategic priorities throughout 2022. Now reflecting on 2022, it truly was a roller-coaster of a year. Much like our peers, we experienced a perfect storm of uncertain macro, tighter customer budgets and longer decision making cycles. As I talk to our customers, a few shifts are increasingly clear. SMBs are doubling down on digital. Their businesses are now built on digital compared to pre-pandemic. They are not turning back. But instead of operating in a buy first, understand value later mode, they are now in a understand value deeply by cautiously mode. HubSpot has always resonated with customers because we deliver easy-to-buy, easy-to-use and easy-to-manage solutions. Now in this environment, we are focused on helping our customers drive innovation and efficiency with a quick time to value with customers taking under eight weeks on average to activate and see value. Throughout 2022, we had two key areas of focus; maintaining our fast pace of product innovation while driving consistent results. On the product side, innovation was just cranking. We relaunched Service Hub, added CMS Hub Free and launched hundreds of new enhancements to meet our customer's evolving needs. Three areas I want to highlight; we drove more omni-channel execution with launches like our WhatsApp integration; more intelligence and insights with customer journey analytics and Campaigns 2.0; and more connected commerce with payment subjects, recurring ACH and payment schedules. It was a record year of innovation capped off by being rated by G2 as the number one global software company in 2023 and the number one product in both Marketing and Sales. Just awesome recognition and a strong testament to the progress we are making on driving innovation. Also, I am happy to announce that we are promoting Andy Pitre to lead our product organization as EVP of Product and User Experience. Andy has had an incredible influence on our product over the past 13 years at HubSpot. He is one of the very early product leaders who drove the CRM platform vision, was the brain behind Operations Hub and is exceptionally customer-centric. Andy will be filling the role formerly held by Steph Cuthbertson, who made a personal decision to step down as Chief Product Officer at the end of 2022. I want to thank Steph for her contributions to HubSpot and wish her the very best. In terms of go-to-market execution, as customer behavior shifted in 2022, we adopted. We leaned more heavily into total cost of ownership and got even better at communicating the tremendous value of HubSpot. We did more team selling and delivered clear messaging to the multiple buyers and personas that are now part of the buying process. In short, we stepped up to the challenge, executed well and helped our customers navigate choppy waters. Now let's shift gears to 2023. Our continued focus is on driving profitable growth, maintaining agility and executing efficiently. I am confident in our ability to normally navigate uncertain times but also to emerge stronger. Here are some of the decisions we have made to help drive long-term profitable growth. First, in January, we announced plans to reduce our workforce by 7% and consolidate our facilities. We made this decision to thoughtfully align our people and resources to strategic business needs. We are also optimizing our real estate portfolio to better align with the needs of our hybrid workforce. These changes will help us drive profitable growth and enable us to invest more in innovation that solves for our customers long into the future. We are also taking steps to drive more efficiency over the long-term. Specifically, we are looking at multiple areas within sales and marketing. On the direct sales side, we are investing in systems and automation to improve rep productivity internally. We are continuing our journey on product-led growth, both to scale the low end of our business with Starter and to drive demand for Pro and Enterprise in a more efficient manner. On the partner side, we are making important changes to our commission structure to align partner incentives with customer value. We are leaning into better reward partners who source demand, who co-sell alongside us and engage deeply with our customers. These are multiyear initiatives and will lead to a more efficient direct, product led and partner sales motions that set us up for profitable growth and margin expansion. I want to wrap up by sharing our strategic objectives for 2023. While the environment may be uncertain, we operate in massive markets and are confidently pursuing our goal of becoming the number one CRM platform for scaling companies. Our first objective is to become the SMB market share leader in marketing, sales and service. We are laser-focused on these three mega markets and we will enable more upmarket customers to adopt HubSpot with easier customization, greater extensibility and better governance capabilities. We will help our customers drive revenue through improved customer journeys and greater rep effectiveness. And we will lean into omni-channel by expanding channels to serve the changing needs of our customers. Our next objective is to continue on our journey to transform B2B commerce. We launched HubSpot Payments a little over a year ago and early customer interest have been strong despite the macro environment. This year, as we continue to ramp, we will be focused on driving greater awareness of our commerce capabilities and increase customer adoption, while adding key functionality like native invoices, flexible billing and flexible payment processing that our customers need. Third, we will double down on our bimodal strategy. Our strategy of focusing on volume of customer adds at the low end, while expanding the value of customers at the upper end is working. We launched CMS Free, introduced self-guided demos, moved automation down to our Starter edition and optimized sign-ups. These initiatives drove results, and we added over 30,000 net new customers last year, with the majority landing on the Starter CRM Suite and expanding beyond. We will continue to find creative ways to make it even easier for customers to get started with HubSpot and get value out of our platform quickly. Our final objective is to build a high performing, sustainable and equitable company. We are focused on foundational investments that can help us scale better. That includes better coaching and development for top talent, better performance culture, better systems and better hybrid connection. We know when we invest in our employees' growth we will drive better outcomes for our customers and for HubSpot. We have a clear opportunity ahead to drive value for our customers and we have the right strategy in place to drive profitable growth. With that, I will hand it over to our CFO, Kate Bueker, to take you through our financial and operating results. Thank you so much, Kate. As I look ahead, we have a clear long-term vision to become the number one CRM platform for scaling companies and a focused strategy in 2023 to make progress on that vision. Our customers continue to depend on HubSpot and we are more motivated than ever to help them grow. We also have a clear strategy to drive profitable growth long-term and thoughtful changes we are making to build a more efficient company. All of this makes me confident in HubSpot's future. I want to thank our employees for their adaptability and continued focus on solving for our customers. I want to thank our customers, our partners and our shareholders for your support. With that, Operator, let's open up the call for questions. Hey, Samad. Thanks a lot for your question. So maybe -- this is Yamini. Maybe I will start with the strategic rationale for the layoff and then give a little bit of color in terms of demand and then Kate can answer the question on guidance. In terms of the layoff, this was the most difficult decision we had to make in HubSpot's history and something that we did not take lightly. And if we step back, this is not simply a short-term cost-cutting decision. This was a strategic realignment of our people and investments so we can drive long-term profitable growth. And there are two reasons why we got to this decision. The first is that we had areas within the business where headcount had grown faster than revenue, areas like recruiting and services, and even when we consider 2023 growth, we had that excess capacity. So we wanted to ensure that our people and our resources are clearly aligned to the growth in 2023 and our strategy in 2023. The second rationale is that we want to invest thoughtfully in key areas of the business to drive profitable growth over the next decade. We want to invest in product innovation so we can drive customer outcomes and emerge stronger from the cycle. We want to invest internally in our own systems and automation wherever we find there are manual processes so we can be even more efficient and innovative as a company. So those were the two reasons why we got to this difficult decision. Now you mentioned the employee letter and the comment that we have made in terms of the demand environment. Look, demand environment in Q4 remained very consistent with what we shared in Q3. We saw deal cycles lengthening. We saw more decision-makers involved. We saw more scrutiny of deals and budgets before approvals. Q4 did not get better, but it did not get materially worse and so what we have assumed is that the demand environment will remain challenging going into 2023. Yeah. Mark, this is Yamini. Thanks a lot for your question. And look, I think, overall, the demand environment has remained consistent. It's not gotten better and it's not gotten materially worse. As we looked at our pipeline, now our pipelines tend to be just current quarter, next quarter, there are a couple of things that we are seeing at the margin, right? Short-cycle deals, ones that are typically created in month and closed in months and they tend to be in the lower end of our segments are continuing to maintain velocity. So we see reasonable velocity there. Longer-cycle deals that typically tend to be upmarket are taking just a little longer to close, and again, this is because of more decision-makers involved, more kind of caution in terms of looking at the budget. And so that's the maybe minor change or shift that I would say in terms of the types of deals. Now if I look at pipeline, I have been talking to customers a lot more in Q3, Q4 and going into Q1, there are few kinds of characteristics of what we see within the pipeline, customers care a lot about time to value. The number one question that I get, we get, is how quickly can we migrate, what is the value and how quickly am I going to get there and HubSpot is resonating because we can deliver value in a matter of weeks, not months. The second thing that we are seeing is people care about driving productivity and a tight alignment between marketing and sales. This is the year where driving clear productivity across marketing and sales and getting much better visibility on the customer's matter and so we begin to see that in the pipeline. And then, finally, eliminating point solutions and driving down costs, a lot of conversations on platform consolidation and with a view towards cost savings, that's what we are seeing. It's a high bar for action amongst customers. That high bar remains. But I am really pleased with how the team is focused on executing in this environment. Yeah. Thanks a lot for the question. Look, we remain very focused. Our segmentation and the segment that we care about deeply is 200 to 2,000 employees. That's the segmentation that we care about. Within that, the 200 to 2,000 segment is what we consider upmarket customers. And as I mentioned, we certainly saw momentum and a lot more larger deals in Q4 and we are continuing to see that now. I think if you step back and think about these larger customers, they are expecting a lot more out of their marketing and sales spend this year. They want more leads. They want better visibility of pipeline. They want better rep effectiveness, and as you think about this, HubSpot delivers that. We are a connected marketing sales and front-office solution and our hubs are clearly delivering value, which is why we see that. The second thing that you mentioned is also around platform consolidation. One of the key priorities this year is to look at the Sales Stack and the Martech Stack and look at ways of eliminating point solutions to drive cost savings and in all of those considerations, HubSpot is becoming the platform of choice. Now that's certainly because of the product momentum we have, it's because our go-to-market has adapted with our partners to be able to drive value for these upmarket customers and we are really proud of the work that the entire organization is doing in terms of where we are in the market. Yeah. Absolutely. Happy to take that, Terry. Look, our partner strategy is working, and a few years ago, we went to our partner ecosystem and we said, look, we are transitioning to marketing automation to CRM platform and our vision is to scale selling and servicing with export partners. That is working and our partner influenced MRR or ARR is about 45% compared to the overall. So it's a good split between direct and partner-influenced MRR. We have momentum. We are co-selling much better over the last three years and partners are behind us. Now I did mention that we are making a structural change to the commission. If we step back, our partner commission was initially set up when HubSpot had one hub and just a couple of additions. This is like 10 years ago. And then as you all know, over the last couple of years, we have expanded our product portfolio. We have added Operations Hub, we have added CMS Hub and we have added more additions to the hub. So as we step back and we looked at our partner commission strategy, we want to incentivize our partners who are now coming along this journey with us to do a couple of things. We want them to first be deeply engaged with customers. When partners get involved with customers, it leads to better close rates and it leads to better retention and we want to drive that. And second, we want to be enabled to incentivize them on driving more multi-hub, as well as co-sells. And so we just announced, I just came from the partner kickoff today, as well as yesterday, where we announced a few changes to the commission structure, which again, incentivizes them to have deeper connection with our customers. And I have been talking to a number of our top partners over the past few weeks in terms of this change they get it, they understand that we are evolving to a multi-hub company and they understand that we are going to continue to invest within the ecosystem. So, overall, excited by the change, as well as the evolution of the partner strategy. Hey, Rishi. Thanks a lot for the question. Look, we are very excited about Service Hub. Last year was a pretty big year. We did relaunch and there were a number of features that move the needle in terms of Service Hub and we see that in the momentum in terms of the go-to-market. Now I mentioned in the prepared remarks a little bit about multi-hub momentum, a lot more three, as well as five hub deals and customer wins that we are seeing and part of that is the strength of Service Hub. And we are going to continue to focus on it, it's one of our strategic objectives in 2023 is to go deep in terms of leadership in Marketing Hub, Sales Hub and Service Hub. And we are evolving to support workspace, we are going to be driving even more omni-channel service through improved calling functionality, knowledge base, SMS. The recent WhatsApp launch in Q4, that was a pretty big win and we got a lot of positive feedback from our customers and we are pretty excited to share more there. As we do these things, we step back and listen, are we getting more multi-hub customers, are we delivering more value and when the customers begin to use it, are we driving improved customer satisfaction. And for each of those questions in Service Hub, the answer is, yes. So we are pleased with it, and it will continue to be a strategic objective this year to drive thought leadership within Service Hub. Yeah. I think like Kate hit on all of the points there. The one thing I would say is, as we think about this mid- to long-term and especially as we think about our sales and marketing efficiency, look, we have product led growth, it's sales rep growth and partner led growth, and all of these are the input engines that then result in our net adds as well as ASRPC. And as we think about each of these three things; product led growth, we are driving more and more initiatives so we can get efficient; sales led growth, we are driving more automation, more systems, more investments so we can make our reps even more productive; and partner led growth, we talked about some of the changes that we are structurally making so that we can become even more efficient. And so as we think about how we balance growth and profitability, we have short-term initiatives and then we have medium-term initiatives and we are really committed to balancing both growth and profitability. Yeah. I think that's a great question. Look, I think, we are seeing both multi-hub lands, as well as strong cross-sells. And let me step back and maybe look at this from the customer perspective. As we talk to customers, a couple of things are becoming very clear. As they think about 2023, it is a lot about driving sales and marketing alignment. The handoff between marketing and sales has all has been tricky. Whose pipeline are you getting and is this good quality of pipeline? So if you think about customers, they want more needs, they want better campaign effectiveness, they want more activity tracking and they want all of this to line up to growth from a sales perspective. And therefore, in our conversations, we see that there are more multi-hub starting points, more starting points with Marketing and Sales and Operations Hub, for example, in the initial sale. So that's happening within new land. And then, similarly, what we see is when our customer has adopted, for example, Marketing or Sales and they see the value proposition of HubSpot, which is easy-to-use, easy-to-manage, driving adoption, then it becomes an easier conversation to have a cross-sell dialogue with the VP of Sales or the VP of Service. And so we do find that in the first year of HubSpot purchase, customers have a high propensity to kind of look at additional hubs and get the visibility across customer base. And so the combination of both of those lead to very healthy three-hub, as well as five-hub wins from a customer perspective. Yeah. Thanks a lot, Brad. Look, I think, if you look at our performance in Q4, we are very pleased, because it shows strength in upmarket, it shows strength in multi-hub and it shows strength in our low end adds of Starter Suite. And this is our bimodal strategy. Our bimodal strategy is we want to add volume of customers at the lower end and as they scale and as they see value within HubSpot, they continue to upgrade to Pro and Enterprise tiers and get even more value from HubSpot and that bimodal strategy working. And in terms of which product areas are we seeing strength, certainly, Marketing and Sales are core front doors and we are very pleased to see Sales Hub become a legitimate front door. A lot more conversations on tying Sales and Marketing and that's an area that we have talked about. And when they buy Sales and Marketing and they want to deeply integrate and connect with other systems within the organization, Ops Hub comes in. And Ops Hub, we have talked about how it drives value from an integration perspective and providing and building on that reporting and then Service Hub. So across all of our core hubs, we are seeing pretty good momentum. In terms of commerce, now that's a longer term bet. We are pleased with the levels of merchant activation, as well as the transactions. It's early, early stages, and there's just a lot more to go, and as I look at our strategy this year, it's super clear. We want to go deep in Marketing, Sales and Service, and we want to continue to maintain the momentum that we have in commerce and we want to do both of those by focusing on the bimodal strategy, which is working. I hope that gives you a little bit more color, Brad. Yeah. Elizabeth, great question. Look, it's very interesting. When we talk to customers, two things are happening at the same time. SMBs are deeply committed to digital and it's -- there was a question about whether SMBs are going to thrive during the pandemic. There's a question about whether SMBs are going to survive this downturn. But what we find is that SMBs are committed to digital. They are continuing to build their businesses on digital. They are continuing to leverage digital solutions to be able to stay in touch with their customers. And I hear this in over and over in my conversations with customers and we see this within the pipeline. Now at the same time, what we have been talking about is that, they want to understand value deeply, they want to buy a little bit more cautiously and that translates into longer deal cycles. I think we, like everybody else, we are going to continue to monitor and continue to look at leading indicators as we go and how does that change our dynamic and how we have adapted our execution? I think a few things based on what we are seeing. We are leading with value. Every conversation is about value, about delivering quick time to value, as well as the cost savings that our customers can see in terms of consolidating on the platform. And our sales teams, as well as the partner organizations are enabled to have these conversations and our value proposition really resonates. So for us the go-to-market has really adopted. And from a product perspective, we are in a place of strength. You just heard us talk about G2. In G2, we have been rated as number one in Marketing, number one in Sales. And we have become a platform of choice for mid-market companies and scaling companies that are looking at options, whether they are driving productivity or they are driving cost savings, we are in those conversations. So I feel even given the macro conditions, the combination of our product innovation, as well as go-to-market execution positions us really strongly. And then, overall, as we all expect me, at some point, this cycle, the economic cycle is going to turn. And so part of the focus in terms of the leadership team is, how do we make strong and thoughtful decisions right now to position ourselves to emerge stronger when the cycle turns. So that's how we think about this year and then beyond. Yeah. Good question, Arjun. Just to kind of share some perspective of how we thought about this. We have mentioned this a couple of times, this was not short-term costing decision. This was a strategic realignment of our investment so that we can drive long-term innovation, as well as scalability within the organization. So as we step back, we look across the company on how best to align our people, resources to our strategy so that we can emerge stronger from this economic cycle. And the fact is we have teams with excess capacity like recruiting and services and those were the areas that we pulled back aggressively. We also looked at areas where there was duplicate work and opportunities for us to be much more efficient. Now throughout the process, we were very careful about protecting product innovation, as well as direct quota carrying roles. And in fact, as we have said a couple of times, we are reinvesting in areas of product, as well as internally so that we can drive scalability. So we feel very good in terms of our strategic objectives and ability to continue to fuel the pace of innovation that we have had. Thank you so much everybody. We really appreciate your support. A huge thanks to HubSpot employees, customers, partners for their resilience as they have navigated all of these times. Look forward to talking to you all next quarter."

Now it's my pleasure to turn over the call to HubSpot's Chief Executive Officer, Yamini Rankin. Yamini?\nYamini Rangan: Thank you so much, Chuck, and welcome to everyone joining us on the call today. Q3 was another solid quarter for HubSpot with revenue growing 38% year-over-year in constant currency. We added over 8,000 net new customers in the quarter, growing our customer base to nearly 160,000 globally, representing 24% growth year-over-year. These strong results reflect our focus on innovation and execution. Our connected platform is clearly driving value for customers, especially as they look to increase efficiencies, while lowering the total cost of ownership during the period of uncertainty. HubSpot continues to be a mission-critical platform for our customers as they depend on us to stay connected with their customers. On the last call, I spoke about the launch of CMS Free and moving marketing automation down into our start-up year. These plays, combined with our focused go-to-market initiatives, drove strong customer adoption and multihub momentum in the quarter. Before I get into some of the trends we're seeing in the business more broadly, I want to reflect on a recent milestone for HubSpot, which was our annual inbound event in September. This year, as you know, we hosted INBOUND in-person in Boston as well as online and had tens of thousands of attendees from all over the world join us. It was clearly a week to remember with incredible speakers and fantastic opportunities to connect with our customers, partners and community. I know many of you attended as well. So thank you again for joining us. I left INBOUND feeling more energized than ever about HubSpot's future. Through my conversations with customers and partners, it becomes even more clear that we are well-positioned to drive long-term durable growth. And there are three key reasons for this. First, we have a unique opportunity to help our customers with solving the crisis of disconnection. I spoke at INBOUND about the prices our customers are facing as a result of disconnected systems, disconnected customers and disconnection from their peers. To solve this crisis, our customers need to be able to seamlessly connect their data, connect with their customers and with each other, all in one place. That's exactly what we've been building at HubSpot with our connected customer platform. We already see the value customers are getting from being able to connect their entire front office. For example, take GrowthLab Financial, a financial services company. Their growth was limited by disconnected tools and a legacy CRM platform. Without a central platform, their team spent hour\u2019s manually tracking prospects and didn't have the insights they needed to optimize their growth. They consolidated onto the HubSpot CRM platform with Marketing Hub, Sales Hub and Service Hub. GrowthLab now uses automation to boost conversion and shorten deal cycles, and leverage the CRM data to get insights on revenue attribution, so they can make more data-driven decisions. Since implementing HubSpot, GrowthLab Financial doubled their revenue and saved a significant amount of time eliminating manual tasks. This is just one great example of how scaling companies can grow better with HubSpot's connected CRM. The second reason we're well-positioned is that our market opportunity is large, expanding and underserved. We operate in massive underserved markets that are forecasted to grow to over $70 billion by 2027. Within this market, we have multiple levers to drive durable long-term growth. Our land and expand motion is working with a majority of our customers trying to treat product before purchasing. And our pathways for expansion have diversified with the breadth and depth we have added in our product. We're also launching into new product categories like payments and commerce, which will continue to open up new avenues for future growth at HubSpot. Even in the weeks since INBOUND, we have a number of new exciting features in private beta, including payment schedules and native invoicing. We're encouraged by the long-term opportunity to help B2B companies transform their buying processes and sell easily online. Finally, our product innovation is cranking. We announced over 80 new product enhancements at INBOUND to meet our customer's evolving needs and help them optimize for connection. Two product highlights where our new campaigns 2.0 tool and customer journey analytics, both are crafted to give businesses a more unified view of their customers experience, and bring data together for deeper insights. We're thrilled to see the positive feedback from data so far. As we look ahead, we\u2019re focused on maintaining the pace of innovation, so we can drive even more value for customers and emerge stronger as the connected platform of choice for the mid-market. I'm energized by the opportunity we have, to solve the crisis of disconnection for our customers, serve mega markets and continue to drive the pace of product innovation in order to set ourselves apart. Next, I want to talk about the demand environment, we see today and reiterate our playbook for managing through it. Last quarter, I talked about the demand trends we were seeing in the business through the end of July, including a lengthening of deal cycles, and more decision-makers involved in deals. Since then, the macro environment has become incrementally more challenging. We see two clear trends in this environment based on our customer and prospect conversations. On one hand, deals are taking longer to close. There are more decision-makers involved, more approval layers and budgets are tighter. We continue to see this across the geographies and segments we serve. On the other hand, HubSpot is emerging as a platform of choice to help customers get through these uncertain times. Our customers need more leads, better conversions and better customer experience. But they need to do it all with less. Our value proposition of easy-to-buy, easy-to-use and easy to build, resonates even more now as customers are looking to consolidate their tech stack. Despite the softer macro environment, I'm confident in HubSpot's playbook for resilient growth through the cycle. Our playbook is based on three core principles that served us well during the pandemic and again, through the macro volatility this year. We talked about these principles last quarter, but there was repeating. The first is solve for the customer, even during uncertain times, one thing we're certain of is that, solving for the customer is good business. What this means right now is that, we are helping customers understand the value of consolidating onto a connected platform and the impact it can have on their total cost of ownership. We're also providing even more functionality at the lower end. We moved high-value features like marketing automation, down to starter, and helping early-stage businesses get online with three CRM and CMS. These plays are resonating with our customers, and you can see it in our results. Second, we will continue to invest in innovation to emerge stronger. We're being more prudent with our hiring as well as discretionary spend, but remain committed to investing in innovation. In fact, we're so thrilled to see that our product investments resulted in HubSpot being recognized as a leader in the Magic Quadrant for B2B marketing automation platforms by Gartner this past quarter. Moving forward, we'll continue to invest and innovate and functionality to help scaling companies optimized for customer connection. Lastly, we execute with focus. For us, it is all about controlling the controllables. We're focused on driving expansion through cross-sell and upsell motions and the percentage of ARR from customers with 3-plus hubs grew nicely within this quarter. We're executing on our bimodal strategy with strength in both net customer additions at the lower end and momentum among larger customers, driving double-digit ASRPC growth. And we're continuing to balance growth and profitability through more measured hiring and tighter control of discretionary spreads. Heading into the end of the year, I feel energized. We have a clear opportunity ahead to drive value for our customers. Our teams are focused on execution, and we have the right playbook in place to drive growth in this uncertain environment. With that, I'll hand it over to Kate.\nKate Bueker: Thanks, Yamini. Let's turn to our Q3 2022 financial results. Third quarter revenue grew 38% year-over-year in constant currency and 31% on an as-reported basis. Q3 subscription revenue grew 32% year-over-year, while services and other revenues decreased 13% on an as-reported basis. Domestic revenue grew 33% year-over-year in Q3, while international revenue growth was 44% in constant currency and 29% as reported. International revenue represented 46% of total revenue in Q3. We added over 8,000 net new customers in the quarter, bringing our total customer count to nearly 160,000, up 24% year-over-year. A big driver of the strength this quarter was customers adopting the starter CRM suite as HubSpot continues to emerge as a platform of choice in times of certainty and uncertainty. Average subscription revenue per customer grew 12% year-over-year in constant currency and 7% on an as-reported basis to $11,200. The primary driver of this strength continues to be professional and enterprise customers adopting multiple products. Despite the more challenging macro environment, we maintained a healthy growth retention rate in the high 80s as customers look to HubSpot platform to drive increased efficiencies. Net revenue retention was 109% in Q3, down quarter-over-quarter as a result of slower net upgrades, particularly in the marketing contact and seat expansion motion. Deferred revenue as of the end of September was $474 million, a 26% increase year-over-year. Calculated billings were $444 million in Q3, growing 34% year-over-year in constant currency and 26% as reported. The remainder of my comments will refer to non-GAAP measures. Third quarter gross margin was 82%, up 2 points year-over-year. Subscription gross margin was 85% in Q3, while services and other gross margin was negative 49%. Third quarter operating margin was 9%, including a 1 point margin headwind from the impact of foreign exchange. Net income in the third quarter was $35 million or $0.69 per fully diluted share. At the end of the third quarter, we had over 7,400 employees, up 35% year-over-year and down 6 points sequentially. We expect our hiring to moderate further in Q4 and to exit the year with headcount growth in the mid- to high 20s. As we discussed last quarter, hiring for the remainder of the year will be focused in R&D and revenue-generating sales headcount. CapEx including capitalized software development costs, was $25 million or 6% of revenue in Q3 and free cash flow in the quarter was $36 million or 8% of revenue. Finally, our cash and marketable securities totaled $1.4 billion at the end of September. And with that, let's review our guidance for the fourth quarter and full year of 2022. As Yamini described in her remarks, the macro environment has become incrementally more difficult through October. It's taking customers longer to make decisions, causing deal cycles to elongate. There are more people involved in the approval process and budgets have tightened. Our guidance assumes that these weaker macroeconomic conditions persist through the remainder of the year. For the fourth quarter, total as reported revenue is expected to be in the range of $444 million to $446 million, up 20% year-over-year at the midpoint. We expect foreign exchange to be a 9-point headwind to as reported revenue growth in the fourth quarter, representing an incremental $4 million headwind relative to our previous forecast. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be between $47 million and $49 million. We expect foreign exchange to be a 2-point headwind to operating profit margin in the fourth quarter. Non-GAAP diluted net income per share is expected to be between $0.82 and $0.84. This assumes 51.2 million fully diluted shares outstanding. And for the full year of 2022, total as reported revenue is now expected to be in the range of $1.705 billion to $1.707 billion, up 31% year-over-year at the midpoint. We expect foreign exchange to be a 6-point headwind to as reported revenue growth for the full year of 2022. Non-GAAP operating income is now expected to be between $152 million and $154 million. We expect foreign exchange to be a 1 point headwind to as reported operating profit margin for the full year of 2022. Non-GAAP diluted net income per share is now expected to be between $2.48 and $2.57. This assumes 51.1 million fully diluted shares outstanding. As you adjust your models, keep in mind the following. We continue to expect CapEx as a percentage of revenue to be roughly 5%, and now expect free cash flow to be about $195 million for the full year of 2022, reflective of the incremental headwind from the strengthening of the US dollar relative to our prior forecast. While it's too early to provide formal guidance for 2023, given the material moves in foreign exchange rates this year, we thought it would be helpful to quantify the impact of foreign exchange on 2023 revenue. At current spot rates, we expect a 4-point or $70 million headwind to as reported revenue growth for the full year of 2023. And with that, I will hand things back over to Yamini for her closing remarks.\nYamini Rangan: Thank you so much, Kate. I want to close by emphasizing that HubSpot is operating from a position of strength. We've built a robust connected customer platform that is meeting the evolving needs of our customers. We have a strong balance sheet and an incredible team and company culture that allows us to attract and retain top talent. We're thrilled for HubSpot to be ranked number one in employee happiness among top rated large companies by comparably just last month. Our culture and people continue to be a competitive advantage for HubSpot. Looking ahead, we will continue to adapt to the realities of the environment without losing sight of our mission to become the number one CRM platform for scaling companies. Thank you so much to our customers. our partners, our employees and shareholders. With that, operator, let's open up the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The first question we have comes from Brian Peterson of Raymond James. Your line is now open, Brian.\nBrian Peterson: Thanks for taking my question, and congrats on the really strong quarter. So maybe taking a step back here, Yamini, we've heard from a number of companies that the macro got incrementally worse over the course of the quarter. It sounds like that was the case for HubSpot as well. Would appreciate any color maybe on what's changed and how you're thinking about the macro impacting fourth quarter guidance?\nYamini Rangan: Yes. Thanks a lot, Brian, for the question. Yes, we are seeing many of the same trends in our customer base that we saw in Q2. It was just a bit more intensified in Q3. We saw the longer deal cycles that we talked about in Q2. We saw more decision makers getting involved in deals and more approvals needed. Typically, we will talk to the VP of Marketing Sales for approval. Now we're talking to the CFO, CEO and sometimes even the Board. Product evaluations are taking longer as buyers are generally much more risk averse and the budgets are tight now. So look, I think we're seeing a lot of things that are very much in line with what you've heard from other companies this quarter, the overall environment is just incrementally more challenging than it was in Q2. Now having said that, Brian, we continue to win and our value proposition resonates really well in this environment. Customers want a clear value case and they want to clear business case for driving efficiency. So we're working with our champions. We're working with our point of contact with the customers to be able to articulate the business case, and then we're able to present to the C suite and Board. Our customers want ease of use and ease of implementation, because the combination of those two lead to time to value, and that's what matters in this environment. Now both of those, ease of use and ease of implementation, they both historically been core differentiators for HubSpot and continues to be a differentiator now, and it's really important in this environment. And then finally, I'd say that customers are looking to standardize on a platform. They're looking to eliminate point solutions. They are looking to reduce their budgets and they're looking to us to be able to bring more data and have a single platform, we're now no longer nice to have solution, we're just becoming a must-have mission-critical solution for our customers. So all of those are resonating within our customer base, and you can see that within our results. Now look, looking forward, we don't have a crystal ball, but we expect these conditions to persist in Q4 and possibly even into 2023. We're navigating through all of these choppy waters from a position of strength and will remain exceptionally focused on executing the playbook that I just walked through.\nBrian Peterson: Great. I appreciate the color. Maybe to follow up, in terms of the value of the platform. Were there certain products kind of on top of marketing that you saw a particular strength in the quarter, whether that's Sales Hub or Service Hub. I'd love to understand maybe where the cross-sell was really successful this quarter? Thanks guys.\nYamini Rangan: Yes. Brian, I think the combination of marketing and sales is becoming exceptionally more important right now. When I talk to customers, they are expecting much more from their marketing and sales for organizations. They are expecting more leads, better lead quality, better conversion, better visibility into the pipeline and they want all of this for less, right?  And that means we're definitely seeing the value of having a connected marketing and sales hub solution that's what is really key within our customer base. And so, when we talk about multihub, most of our multi-hub have Sales Hub and Marketing Hub involved, and we're helping our customers kind of now to get through this environment as well.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question we have from the phone lines comes from Mark Murphy of JPMorgan Chase. Your line is now open, Mark. \nMark Murphy: Yes, thank you very much. I'll have my congrats on the execution in a tough environment. So, I wanted to ask you, as you're building out these more sophisticated enterprise features, which started with custom objects. Could you share perhaps how some of the upper thresholds are changing for HubSpot, if we think about kind of the upper bands for MRR or even speed counts for Sales Hub as you gravitate to the enterprise end up, mostly what I'm wondering is do those continue to increase even despite the macro that you're encountering?\nYamini Rangan: Yes, Mark, thanks a lot for your question. Look, from a segmentation strategy, we're very much focused on the 2 to 2,000 segment. So for us, the upper bounds of the segment continued to be 200 to 2,000 person employee company. The only thing is we're winning our fair share within that market. And as you rightly pointed out, over the past couple of years, we have invested going upmarket with features like custom objects at inbound we announced more than 80 new enhancements and features across the entire platform and a number of these enhancements and features are really driving better UI customization, better data management, advanced permissioning, granular ability for admins to control the environment. So a lot of the features have enabled us to win our fair share going up market and in this environment, one of the things that we see is customers, as I just talked about, care about better visibility, but they also care about better time to value and cost-effective solution. So going back to really the fundamental value proposition of HubSpot were easy to use, but we have very powerful features, and that makes us exceptionally competitive in that tough market. So we're remaining true to the segmentation and winning our fair share of that market.\nMark Murphy: I understand. Thank you, Yamini. And just as a quick follow-up, I was wondering if you or Kate, could you just clarify because I think we're trying to maybe understand somewhere in the results where we would see some of the signs of incremental strain. But just based on what you saw, are you trying to convey that the month of September and October did in fact, feel a bit tougher save in July and August in terms of the friction in the selling cycle because I think that's generally what we're hearing elsewhere.\nYamini Rangan: Yes. It should be very clear. What we saw in Q3 was just an incrementally more challenging environment than what we saw in Q2. And specifically, budgets are tight and every approval is being carefully considered. And because of that, the approval processes are longer, customers are spending a little bit more time getting a value case delivered to their fee level for approval and sometimes even going to the board. So, we're continuing to see that pressure. We're also seeing the need for a crystal care plan to deliver value, which means more time to understand implementation plans, user adoption plans, more times to understand the training plans. And all of this means that there is just a lot more rigor, more demos, and more conversations. So, we definitely are seeing incrementally more challenging environment from a macro perspective. Having said that, like we talked about, we've put in some place from being focused on the customer and those plays continue to work at the bottom end, which is where you see the strength in net adds and our multi-hub value proposition is resonating. And so we'll continue to work through this choppy environment.\nMark Murphy: Excellent. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. We now have Samad Samana from Jefferies. Please go ahead when you're ready.\nSamad Samana: Hi, great. Thank you. And I'll secret work and focus by the whole organization sets on op spotters great job. Yamini, maybe the first one for you. I know you talked about the macro getting incrementally worse, longer cycle, more approval. But what you didn't mention is a change in the top of the funnel or maybe inbound interest. So, just could you shed some light on, are you seeing any changes in terms of the customers that are reaching out or coming into the top of the funnel and just interest levels, maybe is that even uptick because you had inbound in this quarter? Just -- maybe help us understand what you're seeing at the top of the funnel versus just in terms of the deal closings or the cycles?\nYamini Rangan: Samad, thanks a lot, and I will double down and emphasize, I think, congratulations to the entire company, both in the product and flywheel and the entire company for executing in a very tough macro environment. Look, on the demand side, if you consider a year ago, it was primarily all inbound. So, with a lot of people raising hands and coming to us mostly qualified. And so it was fairly quick to take that kind of a qualified lead and convert it into a customer win. What we are beginning to see is that, that level of inbound has changed. And right now, it's a combination of that and our customer success team, our sales organization, going to new customers and going through prospects and having conversations about HubSpot. So, it's a combination of people raising their hands and coming to us. And that part of it has slowed down a little bit. So, it's us going back to our installed base and having conversations on how we can add more value. So certainly, from a demand perspective, we see a pretty big shift from last year and somewhat of a shift from the first half of the year. Having said that, what I'd say is like there's just a higher bar to action within the pipeline. There's more conversations, more approvals and more demos that are needed to get to action. And so the way, I would characterize, it is demand has slowed. We've compensated it by going out and proactively having conversations to the customer base, and it takes much longer for us to close, and we continue to be very, very focused on executing in this environment.\nSamad Samana: Very helpful. And then maybe, Kate, if I could just ask a quick follow-up, I wanted to make sure, I think you said a 4 point FX headwind, where things stand today for 2023 revenue, was that \u2013 one, did I hear that correctly? And two, is that the level that you had assumed when you gave the flat margin guidance at the Analyst Day, or should we rethink that as well?\nKate Bueker: Yeah. Thanks for asking. I do think it's a really important point for us to communicate. As you know, foreign exchange has been one of those things that has moved pretty dramatically throughout 2022, but frankly, like even within the back half of Q3. And so you are right, given sort of current foreign exchange rates, we would have a 4-point headwind to 2023 revenue growth, and that's about a $70 million nominal headwind. Foreign exchange did get harder in the last couple of months. You heard us talk about our Q4 guidance as having an incremental $4 million of headwind relative to the last time we guided you should assume that 2023 saw similar trends to that.\nSamad Samana: Okay. Thank you so much.\nDharmesh Shah: Samad, as far as we did \u2013 as far as the 8% margin that we talked about at the Analyst Day, it did incorporate where rates stand today.\nSamad Samana: Okay. Perfect. Thank you for clarifying. Have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you so much. We now have Arjun Bhatia of William Blair. Please go ahead. Please go ahead, when you\u2019re ready, Arjun.\nArjun Bhatia: Yes, perfect. Thank you for taking my questions. I'll have my congrats on the quarter. Yamini, understandably as more buyers and more approval levels get involved in the process that creates a tougher selling environment. But you did mention that you're getting a little bit more exposure, higher in the organization to the C-suite to the Board. What does this do for HubSpot in your ability to pay yourself as a more strategic partner to make a broader platform sale to maybe buyers that you didn't have access to as much in prior years? And how equipped do you think the sales team is to make that pitch to those higher-level buyers at this point?\nYamini Rangan: Yeah. Really good question. Certainly, more CEOs, CFOs, CTOs than we have dealt with in the past. And it is \u2013 while the conversations take longer, they are really good conversations. And the way, I'd characterize it is that when we talk to the C we've written our customer organizations, there are a few things that matter to them. First is time to value. They really care about how quickly they're going to get to value and how their teams are going to see the impact. And so part of it us having a clear articulation of value as well as cost savings to the C-suite. The second is really talking about the value of a consolidated platform. There -- over the past couple of years, a lot of these companies have ended up buying disconnected point solutions and that's costing them. And so when we have conversations with CEOs and CFOs, we talk about how we can help them with eliminating some of these point solutions and consolidating and seeing the value of a consolidated platform and that certainly resonates. Now, on the second part of your question, this has meant that we've doubled down on enablement for our sales team for our customer success team as well as the partner organization. We've rolled out TCO playbook as well as value playbook so that they can bring these conversations earlier in the sales process. They can proactively talk about how we can help them get to time to value as well as cost savings. And that part of the enablement is something that we're doubling down, and we're doubling down in terms of execution as well. So, absolutely see all of those within the pipeline.\nArjun Bhatia: Okay, perfect. Very helpful. And then the other part, your new customer adds actually ticked up, and this is something that we're not seeing, I think, with your peers where new customers have seen greater headwinds. I'm curious, as you look at the new customer cohort that's coming in, are you seeing more replacement opportunities even in that starter CRM suite where customers are wanting to rip out existing solutions versus more of a greenfield opportunity than you may have seen in the past?\nKate Bueker: Yes. Thanks for the question. Maybe I'll dive in. You are right. The net adds for the quarter came in a little better than we had even expected. And where we saw the strength was really at that starter here, particularly in the starter CRM suite. These are not customers that typically are working and replacing. These are customers where HubSpot is the first tool that they are largely using. And there's a couple of things that we think really contributed to the strength this quarter and talked a little bit about them. But you may remember, we took a bunch of actions last quarter that were really customer-first in nature that leaned into the value proposition at the starter tier. One is that we added automation to Marketing Hub Starter. We launched CMS Free at inbound, and we continue to experiment on pricing and packaging in that starter tier. And it's really the combination of these three actions that we believe drove the increase in net customer additions quarter-over-quarter. It's not something we solve for. It's an output. Our goal is really to drive both long-term and short-term growth in the business. But this quarter, the plays that worked really drove customer additions and really focused customer additions at the low end. The one thing that I would just add about that is there's two pieces of the KPI equation. One is the net customer additions, the other is ASRPC. And so when you see really strong quarters like this one in terms of net customer adds, particularly at Starter, what you're going to see on the other side is a little less strength in the ASRPC growth. And as a result, what I would encourage you to see in like a Q4 is that ASRPC will likely be more like 10% in constant currency.\nDharmesh Shah: And one thing I'd like to add just on that starter tier is that, obviously, it's nice to have the revenue from those 8,000 new customer adds. But the other way, it helps is that kind of part of our bimodal strategy, which is \u2013 as we get more and more customers, it kind of helps with our brand in the word of mouth, which has been a strong driver of growth for HubSpot historically. And the second piece is that, we're looking to build a CRM platform that's a defacto standard in SMB. And the more customers we have, the more attractive the platform is for third-party applications to build on for solutions partners to kind of partner up with our customers. So it's just \u2013 it's a net positive all around, but that started years, it's been a really strong driver for us.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Rishi Jaluria from RBC. Please go ahead, Rishi. Your line is now open.\nRishi Jaluria: Wonderful. Thanks so much for taking my questions. Nice to see continued execution in spite of the macro. I want to go back to the commentary about the opportunity to consolidate point solutions. I think that makes a lot of sense in theory, I was wondering, if you could point to any examples of that sort of behavior that you've already seen? And if there are particular areas within the Martech Stack or within CRM that you're already seeing that sort of interest from existing customers? And then I've got a quick follow-up.\nYamini Rangan: Yeah. Rishi, the elimination of foreign solutions is a place where customers look to as their budget gets super constrained, right? And again, an example in the prepared remarks of one of our customers kind of consolidating, there are many more like that, that we're having conversations. We have a ERP software solution organization in North America. So we're using multiple tools for marketing as well as their sales efforts, and all of that was extremely manual siloed and so they looked to us. And over a period of time, we had multiple conversations in initially started with Marketing Hub and then extended to marketing and sales and eliminating six tools as we were looking to help them consolidate their go-to-market stack. And so that led to not only this improved marketing efforts, but also reducing their overall spend. So a number of customers. Now, I'm not saying that these are easy. I'm not saying that, these are quick because that's not happening within this environment. But when we start with either marketing or sales, we do have the opportunity to engage with our customers strategically and talk about their entire stack and how we can help them consolidate their stack.\nOperator: Thank you. We now have Alex Zukin of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Please go ahead, when you\u2019re ready.\nAlex Zukin: Hey, guys. So just maybe two numbers questions for me. I guess I want to understand, given the commentary on the incremental macro and demand environment, which doesn't seem to be denting gross retention today. I guess, how do we think about your assumptions for gross retention for Q4? And also net revenue retention, that 109%, do we \u2013 like does it kind of go down and then stabilize at some notional level when we think about Q4 and beyond? And then on the margin side, I guess to the \u2013 is it fair to assume you're reiterating kind of the margin guide you gave for 2023 at the Analyst Day? And is that \u2013 just remind us how you think about that balance of growth and profitability. Again, in the context of the first question, if you do continue to see the macro deterioration, what are the levers that you have for next year?\nKate Bueker: Yes. Why don't I start and then on to the extent that you have comments to add, please don't have the page to dive in. You're right, Alex, I shared in the prepared remarks, data points for both growth and net retention this quarter remained in the high 80s. Net revenue retention fell to 109%, and that was a result of really lower net upgrade motions from that gross retention. We've talked about this. We talked about it on the last earnings call. We talked again about it at Analyst Day that we thought we would see pressure on that net revenue retention in the near-term, really as a result of the macro environment factors sort of the difficulty that we're seeing there. So, I would expect that you would see Q4 net revenue retention continue to be pressured for like all the same reasons that we are seeing in Q3. I think the good news in all of this is that we have seen the customer dollar retention really stick in the high 80s, into Q3 and again into October, like our customers are staying with HubSpot. They are doing things to optimize like cleaning up contacts and eliminating our new seats. They're upgrading seat at potentially a lower rate. But we think that it puts us in a really nice position as we start to see the economy turn to really lean into that growth with the recovery. Over the long-term, we still feel good about 110% plus. But to your question, in Q4, we think will continue -- net revenue retention will continue to be fostered. And then on your margin question, as it relates to the 2023 margin that we talked about at the Analyst Day, look, if I just take a step back, I think that about 2023 as having a few things that are really driving the margin profile for the year. The first is we hired pretty aggressively in 2021. We hired pretty aggressively into the first half of 2022. And we want to realize the productivity efficiency from these hires. But when you think about 2023, you're going to see a full year of the cost associated with that hiring. The second thing that I would say is we have actually pulled back pretty significantly and taken a number of steps to reduce hiring in the back half of this year and reduce overall discretionary spending in things like T&E and facilities, and we're going to continue to do that as we move into 2023. And then finally, we talked a little bit about foreign exchange and the impact on 2023. There is real FX headwind to operating margin. It's about 1 point in this year 2022. It's an incremental point in 2023. And so if I just sort of step back and think about all of those things, we're doing a bunch of -- or taking a bunch of actions to be really prudent in our spending and we're going to continue to do that into 2023. But we will retain investment in certain areas like R&D and revenue-generating headcount to preserve growth both in the near-term and long-term. So, all that said, we said 8%. We're committed to delivering 8% and we will share a very specific guidance with you when we announce our Q4 results.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We have the next question from Gabriela Borges of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, when you\u2019re ready.\nGabriela Borges: Good afternoon and thank you. One clarification on the earlier demand comments. Is the rate of change still getting worse in 4Q, or is it stable at the new lower demand level? And then for my question, I want to ask about the earlier comments on the shift in demand from orphan inbound merchant to HubSpot catalyze mission. What are the implications for customer acquisition costs longer term? Do you think that this dynamic is more temporary or structural in nature? And I'm looking to understand as well, is it cheaper for HubSpot to sell but to acquire $1 in the installed base or in the new customer lands? So a couple of things in there, I would appreciate the color. Thank you/\nYamini Rangan: Gabriela, multiple questions there. I try to answer those, and I'm sure Kate can jump in there as well. In terms of the demand, we did see an incrementally more challenging environment from a demand perspective in Q3 than we saw in Q4. It's a new level, it's not getting worse. It is an incrementally more challenging demand environment than Q2, and all of the things that we talked about, more conversations, more time to get approval, more demos. All of that adds to that incrementally challenging environment. And when I talked about last year, almost everything that we did was just inbound where we had customers coming in, was in their hands coming to us, wanting digital transformation. Right now, that is not the kind of tailwind that you can hear from all of the macro commentary at abating even other peers within the industry. It's a combination of some of the inbound demand, the digital trend is continuing, but it is kind of metered by the cyclical macro trends. And so partly, our teams have to go engage with our customers and identify opportunities for them to save cost or consolidate on a platform or continue on the digital journey. And yeah, I think it's cyclical in nature. I think it's based on what is currently happening from a macro environment perspective. And the overall structural need for digital and the belief that our customers have in digital transformation has not changed. Kate, do you want to add anything on the latter part of the cash question?\nKate Bueker: Yeah. Why don't I do that \u2013 I think, Gabriela, what I at least tried to communicate during the Analyst Day is that we have a number of different motions to acquire new customers. And we are continuing to make investments in all of those motions that we think are over the long term going to drive real leverage on the sales and marketing side. So we talked about a number of them at the Analyst Day. We're investing in the data and systems that are really designed to improve rent efficiency that helps a lot of this all-bound motion that Yamini is talking about. We're continuing to invest in our product-led freemium motion. We've been doing that for a number of years, and we still think there's a lot of runway there. And we're investing in linear growth opportunities by commerce, right? And so all of those are long-term bets for us that will take time to impact the P&L, but will ultimately drive nice leverage in our go-to-market.  In the more near-term, we do have a number of plays that are focused on driving increased productivity in the sales organization. Again, Yamini talked about a number of these. We have invested pretty aggressively in sales enablement. We're arming both sales teams and also our customer success teams with TCO playbooks that really helps them engage customers in a relevant way at the moment. We're leaning into the partner channel that's always been a successful channel and it's even more important when we see sort of upmarket more complicated multiproduct deals. And we're really looking at our own marketing organization to drive efficiencies in top-of-funnel demand investment. So all of those things we believe can translate into higher sales productivity even in this more difficult environment.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead when you're ready Keith.\nKeith Weiss: Excellent. Thank you guys and thank you for taking the questions. Really nice quarter in an environment that everyone on our side of the fence, we're definitely quite worried about given the macro trends that we're seeing. In particular, we're most worried has been in Europe. And so I was wondering, one, if you could kind of get your guys' perspective on trends in Europe versus the US? I know you guys talked about Europe a little bit last quarter. Has that -- incremental weakness, has that spread into the US more so because of your team numbers were -- or your international growth was strong this quarter on a constant currency basis? And then two, when you're talking about these macro impacts, it sounds a lot like it's new customers coming in the door, but the new customer count was good. Am I misunderstanding that is the like elongation of sales cycles, is that on upsells as well as bringing new customers in the door or like where did that really reared? Thank you.\nYamini Rangan: Yes. Let me answer the first one, and then maybe Kate can answer the second part. So, international revenue grew 44% in constant currency in Q3. That's pretty good in the macro environment like this. As we mentioned before, even starting in Q1 and certainly in Q2, the trend for longer deal cycles started in EMEA. But however, what we're seeing now is the macro environment is just broad-based. We're now seeing the trends that's starting at kind of across all segments and all geos. So, really not a notable difference in EMEA versus North America for now.\nKeith Weiss: That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.\nKate Bueker: Yes, you cut out a little bit, and I think you were asking whether or not elongated deal cycles were seen across both new customers and existing customers. The answer we are seeing elongated sales cycles everywhere. And so there isn't anything that I would necessarily call out other than what Yamini has already talked about, which is the action is just higher across the board.\nKeith Weiss: Got it. So, when we see your new customer count actually like improving nicely in this quarter despite those elongated deal cycles. Is it a difference in kind of like the starter addition and sort of the experimentation you're doing there, enabled better new customer additions at the low end, but the higher-end stuff is where you saw the longer deal cycles?\nKate Bueker: I mean, you are exactly right. The investments and experiments we're doing at the low end with our freemium motion and product-led growth are the key drivers for our quarter-over-quarter uptick in new customer additions.\nOperator: Thank you. We now have a question from Brad Sills of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nBrad Sills: Great. Thank you. I wanted to ask a question around Service Hub. It's a big category and one where you've made a big step forward with the new release earlier this year. Just curious, is there a different sales audience here versus sales and marketing versus support, particularly as you go upmarket, or is it that platform sale here where you're already in sales and marketing you've got that warm lead. Just curious to get your thoughts on just the adoption curve for Service Hub versus sales and marketing at your end of the market? Thank you.\nDharmesh Shah: Yeah. Thanks for the question. So I mean, as you noted in last quarter, we kind of did a re-launch of Service Hub Pro with a bunch of really pivotal features, including SLAs and mobile health desk and inbound calling. And that's really going to kind of open the door for kind of more sophisticated service team to be able to implement Service Hub. And to kind of get to your question, what's happening now with Service Hub, we kind of asked ourselves a post launch are more people buying Service Hub? Are they adopting the feature sets more readily? Are they happy with the product? And the answer to all those questions is yes. So we're overall kind of happy with where Service Hub is headed. But right now, we're still seeing a lot of interest in kind of multi-hub deals, a lot of cross-sell between marketing and sales and going to what Yamini spoke of earlier, people just want visibility into the entire market sales pipeline going all the way to customer service and success. So Service Hub right now is a kind of strong participant in that multi-hub cross-sell opportunity. Over the midterm, we think it will become an increasingly \u2013 increasing large opportunity for being a kind of front door where people come in as a result of service having then we sell marketing and sells up to those customers. But right now, very strong. I'm looking to cross-sell motion and multi-hub deals. But we're kind of pleased with the progress.\nOperator: Thank you. We now have Michael Turrin of Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead, when you\u2019re ready. \nMichael Turrin: Hi, there. Thanks. Obviously, a lot to talk about. I mean, I just wanted to take a step back and the two key metrics that we tend to focus on, just based on the disclosure, the net new customers and the ASRPC number. With 8,000 net new added and 14% constant currency growth on that number in Q3, I'm not sure we've seen those metrics work as well and balance this quarter as what we're generally used to seeing. So I can appreciate the commentary around the starter. I think that's useful. But can you just talk more about the interplay? I know you don't necessarily manage the business to these two inputs, but the reasons that they're both coming through so well, particularly given a tough macro backdrop, I think it's just useful for us all to hear a bit more about.\nKate Bueker: Yeah. Thank you, Michael. I mean in truth, the trend that we're seeing this quarter and the KPIs are a continuation of some of the trends that we've been seeing for a while, particularly in ASRPC, our strength in installed base selling is very much aligned with the platform value that you are hearing from Yamini at that professional and enterprise. And that is what is enabling us to continue to grow ASRPC even with the larger customer ads at the low end.\nOperator: Thank you. We now have Ken Wong from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead when you're ready. We have had no response from the line. Ken Wong could you cancel if you're on mute? We now have had no response.\nChuck MacGlashing: Operator, move on to the next question.\nOperator: We now have the next question from Parker Lane of Stifel. Your line is open.\nParker Lane: Yes, hi. Thanks for taking the question. Wondering if you could comment on the general health of the partner channel. A lot of your agency partners are small businesses themselves. So, wondering if they're seeing any added pressure here. And just overall, what is the performance of the agency partner channel look like relative to your own direct sales efforts and inbound demand?\nYamini Rangan: Yes, Parker, really good question. I think, look, no one is immune to the macro headwinds that we are overall seeing. So, I think if VPA partners will also see it. Now, having said that, we have about 6,000 partners within our overall ecosystem and they contribute about 40% of our revenue. Over the last couple of years, we have invested pretty heavily in the partners in terms of enabling the partners in terms of helping them kind of really transform from being a marketing agency to a full-fledged CRM implementer and being able to take our upmarket customers and drive sales distal for of market customers. And I'd say that is working really well. Partner contribution to total rep-driven MRR, both what they're sourcing as well as what they are co-selling with HubSpot is doing well. It was pretty high in Q2, and it continued to be pretty high in Q3, and that's sign that partners are very engaged and they are moving on the journey with us as we really provide a platform for scaling companies. So, we're happy with how our partners are executing and they're executing in a tough environment. So, huge thanks and shout out to them.\nOperator: Thank you. We now have Sarah Hindlian from Macquarie. Please go ahead when you're ready.\nSarah Hindlian: Great. Thank you so much for squeezing me in. I really appreciate you it. Maybe I want to ask a little bit more of an access question. When you're in year-on-year meetings and you're speaking about the C-suite, I would be curious to know what you're seeing about their desire to move marketing away from some of the really predominant social platforms that seem to be stumbling a little bit right now or perhaps where strength is moving to TikTok, and how that's helping drive more conversations around inbound marketing?\nYamini Rangan: Hey Sarah, thanks for that. I'm going to maybe just started and then Dharmesh, feel free to jump in here as well. Look, the conversations right now are all around driving efficiency, driving time to value, and getting results that can impact the outcomes in the near-term, right? And as we think about that, omni-channel marketing is really important. When I have conversations with CMOs mean CEOs, who within customers, they clearly understand that it cannot be just one channel. And so a lot of it is omni-channel marketing. And this is why what we announced and launched at inbound, which our teams worked really hard on customer journey analytics and campaigns, 2.0 functionality. Both of those really meet the needs of where the marketing organization is expected to step up and deliver right now. And that's the kind of conversations that we are having. In general, a lot of marketing spend is around driving direct impact to revenue and pipeline in the short term and away from things like ad spend or even spend or brand spend. That is what we are hearing based on talking to customers.\nDharmesh Shah: Yeah. One quick thing I would add is that it's a combination of \u2013 there's these new channels emerging and it has to be omni-channel. Part of HubSpot's differentiated value proposition is that because everything is on one data platform in one database, wanting to bad experience, we have the data to be able to draw the insight, not just how many people visit the website or how many engaged in social or how many through ads, like who were those customers, what was the revenue associated with that, we can do kind of full circuit reporting, which is really hard to do when you get kind of the siloed products, and that's one of the appeals of the HubSpot platform.\nOperator: Thank you. We have a final question from Siti Panigrahi from Mizuho. Please go ahead, when you\u2019re ready.\nSiti Panigrahi: Thank you. Thanks for squeezing me in. Not sure, if this questions, was asked. If I look at your Q4 guidance, that looks really conservative when I look at historical guide for 4Q, usually like 4% sequential versus flat this year. So, wondering, is this mostly FX or you have some kind of incremental conservatives impact into the guidance considering the macro environment?\nKate Bueker: Why don't I \u2013 I'll take that. I think if you were paying attention on the call, we definitely spent a lot of time talking about the challenging environment in which we're operating, and that is certainly reflected in the Q4 guidance. In addition, you highlight FX that is also an incremental headwind for us into Q4. We called out $4 million of incremental headwind as a result of foreign exchange movements. And so it's really both of those things that are contributing to our Q4 guidance. We are assuming that the environment stays about how it is operating today. And as always, we want to make sure that we can \u2013 we're confident in our ability to deliver even if it gets just a little bit worse from here.\nOperator: Thank you. I would now like to hand it back to Yamini for any final remarks.\nYamini Rangan: Well, I want to do a big call out to HubSpotters globally. They are just so focused on executing. So thank my heart call thanks to all the employees and all things to customers, partners and investors, look forward to talking to you next year.\nOperator: Thank you for joining. This does conclude today's call. Have a lovely day, and you may now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Dharmesh Shah",
            "content": "Samad, as far as we did \u2013 as far as the 8% margin that we talked about at the Analyst Day, it did incorporate where rates stand today. And one thing I'd like to add just on that starter tier is that, obviously, it's nice to have the revenue from those 8,000 new customer adds. But the other way, it helps is that kind of part of our bimodal strategy, which is \u2013 as we get more and more customers, it kind of helps with our brand in the word of mouth, which has been a strong driver of growth for HubSpot historically. And the second piece is that, we're looking to build a CRM platform that's a defacto standard in SMB. And the more customers we have, the more attractive the platform is for third-party applications to build on for solutions partners to kind of partner up with our customers. So it's just \u2013 it's a net positive all around, but that started years, it's been a really strong driver for us. Yeah. Thanks for the question. So I mean, as you noted in last quarter, we kind of did a re-launch of Service Hub Pro with a bunch of really pivotal features, including SLAs and mobile health desk and inbound calling. And that's really going to kind of open the door for kind of more sophisticated service team to be able to implement Service Hub.

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Kate Bueker",
            "content": "Thanks, Yamini. Let's turn to our Q3 2022 financial results. Third quarter revenue grew 38% year-over-year in constant currency and 31% on an as-reported basis. Q3 subscription revenue grew 32% year-over-year, while services and other revenues decreased 13% on an as-reported basis. Domestic revenue grew 33% year-over-year in Q3, while international revenue growth was 44% in constant currency and 29% as reported. International revenue represented 46% of total revenue in Q3. We added over 8,000 net new customers in the quarter, bringing our total customer count to nearly 160,000, up 24% year-over-year. A big driver of the strength this quarter was customers adopting the starter CRM suite as HubSpot continues to emerge as a platform of choice in times of certainty and uncertainty. Average subscription revenue per customer grew 12% year-over-year in constant currency and 7% on an as-reported basis to $11,200. The primary driver of this strength continues to be professional and enterprise customers adopting multiple products. Despite the more challenging macro environment, we maintained a healthy growth retention rate in the high 80s as customers look to HubSpot platform to drive increased efficiencies. Net revenue retention was 109% in Q3, down quarter-over-quarter as a result of slower net upgrades, particularly in the marketing contact and seat expansion motion. Deferred revenue as of the end of September was $474 million, a 26% increase year-over-year. Calculated billings were $444 million in Q3, growing 34% year-over-year in constant currency and 26% as reported. The remainder of my comments will refer to non-GAAP measures. Third quarter gross margin was 82%, up 2 points year-over-year. Subscription gross margin was 85% in Q3, while services and other gross margin was negative 49%. Third quarter operating margin was 9%, including a 1 point margin headwind from the impact of foreign exchange. Net income in the third quarter was $35 million or $0.69 per fully diluted share. At the end of the third quarter, we had over 7,400 employees, up 35% year-over-year and down 6 points sequentially. We expect our hiring to moderate further in Q4 and to exit the year with headcount growth in the mid- to high 20s. As we discussed last quarter, hiring for the remainder of the year will be focused in R&D and revenue-generating sales headcount. CapEx including capitalized software development costs, was $25 million or 6% of revenue in Q3 and free cash flow in the quarter was $36 million or 8% of revenue. Finally, our cash and marketable securities totaled $1.4 billion at the end of September. And with that, let's review our guidance for the fourth quarter and full year of 2022. As Yamini described in her remarks, the macro environment has become incrementally more difficult through October. It's taking customers longer to make decisions, causing deal cycles to elongate. There are more people involved in the approval process and budgets have tightened. Our guidance assumes that these weaker macroeconomic conditions persist through the remainder of the year. For the fourth quarter, total as reported revenue is expected to be in the range of $444 million to $446 million, up 20% year-over-year at the midpoint. We expect foreign exchange to be a 9-point headwind to as reported revenue growth in the fourth quarter, representing an incremental $4 million headwind relative to our previous forecast. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be between $47 million and $49 million. We expect foreign exchange to be a 2-point headwind to operating profit margin in the fourth quarter. Non-GAAP diluted net income per share is expected to be between $0.82 and $0.84. This assumes 51.2 million fully diluted shares outstanding. And for the full year of 2022, total as reported revenue is now expected to be in the range of $1.705 billion to $1.707 billion, up 31% year-over-year at the midpoint. We expect foreign exchange to be a 6-point headwind to as reported revenue growth for the full year of 2022. Non-GAAP operating income is now expected to be between $152 million and $154 million. We expect foreign exchange to be a 1 point headwind to as reported operating profit margin for the full year of 2022. Non-GAAP diluted net income per share is now expected to be between $2.48 and $2.57. This assumes 51.1 million fully diluted shares outstanding. As you adjust your models, keep in mind the following. We continue to expect CapEx as a percentage of revenue to be roughly 5%, and now expect free cash flow to be about $195 million for the full year of 2022, reflective of the incremental headwind from the strengthening of the US dollar relative to our prior forecast. While it's too early to provide formal guidance for 2023, given the material moves in foreign exchange rates this year, we thought it would be helpful to quantify the impact of foreign exchange on 2023 revenue. At current spot rates, we expect a 4-point or $70 million headwind to as reported revenue growth for the full year of 2023. And with that, I will hand things back over to Yamini for her closing remarks. Yeah. Thanks for asking. I do think it's a really important point for us to communicate. As you know, foreign exchange has been one of those things that has moved pretty dramatically throughout 2022, but frankly, like even within the back half of Q3. And so you are right, given sort of current foreign exchange rates, we would have a 4-point headwind to 2023 revenue growth, and that's about a $70 million nominal headwind. Foreign exchange did get harder in the last couple of months. You heard us talk about our Q4 guidance as having an incremental $4 million of headwind relative to the last time we guided you should assume that 2023 saw similar trends to that. Yes. Thanks for the question. Maybe I'll dive in. You are right. The net adds for the quarter came in a little better than we had even expected. And where we saw the strength was really at that starter here, particularly in the starter CRM suite. These are not customers that typically are working and replacing. These are customers where HubSpot is the first tool that they are largely using. And there's a couple of things that we think really contributed to the strength this quarter and talked a little bit about them. But you may remember, we took a bunch of actions last quarter that were really customer-first in nature that leaned into the value proposition at the starter tier. One is that we added automation to Marketing Hub Starter. We launched CMS Free at inbound, and we continue to experiment on pricing and packaging in that starter tier. And it's really the combination of these three actions that we believe drove the increase in net customer additions quarter-over-quarter. It's not something we solve for. It's an output. Our goal is really to drive both long-term and short-term growth in the business. But this quarter, the plays that worked really drove customer additions and really focused customer additions at the low end. The one thing that I would just add about that is there's two pieces of the KPI equation. One is the net customer additions, the other is ASRPC. And so when you see really strong quarters like this one in terms of net customer adds, particularly at Starter, what you're going to see on the other side is a little less strength in the ASRPC growth. And as a result, what I would encourage you to see in like a Q4 is that ASRPC will likely be more like 10% in constant currency. Yes. Why don't I start and then on to the extent that you have comments to add, please don't have the page to dive in. You're right, Alex, I shared in the prepared remarks, data points for both growth and net retention this quarter remained in the high 80s. Net revenue retention fell to 109%, and that was a result of really lower net upgrade motions from that gross retention. We've talked about this. We talked about it on the last earnings call. We talked again about it at Analyst Day that we thought we would see pressure on that net revenue retention in the near-term, really as a result of the macro environment factors sort of the difficulty that we're seeing there. So, I would expect that you would see Q4 net revenue retention continue to be pressured for like all the same reasons that we are seeing in Q3. I think the good news in all of this is that we have seen the customer dollar retention really stick in the high 80s, into Q3 and again into October, like our customers are staying with HubSpot. They are doing things to optimize like cleaning up contacts and eliminating our new seats. They're upgrading seat at potentially a lower rate. But we think that it puts us in a really nice position as we start to see the economy turn to really lean into that growth with the recovery. Over the long-term, we still feel good about 110% plus. But to your question, in Q4, we think will continue -- net revenue retention will continue to be fostered. And then on your margin question, as it relates to the 2023 margin that we talked about at the Analyst Day, look, if I just take a step back, I think that about 2023 as having a few things that are really driving the margin profile for the year. The first is we hired pretty aggressively in 2021. We hired pretty aggressively into the first half of 2022. And we want to realize the productivity efficiency from these hires. But when you think about 2023, you're going to see a full year of the cost associated with that hiring. The second thing that I would say is we have actually pulled back pretty significantly and taken a number of steps to reduce hiring in the back half of this year and reduce overall discretionary spending in things like T&E and facilities, and we're going to continue to do that as we move into 2023. And then finally, we talked a little bit about foreign exchange and the impact on 2023. There is real FX headwind to operating margin. It's about 1 point in this year 2022. It's an incremental point in 2023. And so if I just sort of step back and think about all of those things, we're doing a bunch of -- or taking a bunch of actions to be really prudent in our spending and we're going to continue to do that into 2023. But we will retain investment in certain areas like R&D and revenue-generating headcount to preserve growth both in the near-term and long-term. So, all that said, we said 8%. We're committed to delivering 8% and we will share a very specific guidance with you when we announce our Q4 results. Yeah. Why don't I do that \u2013 I think, Gabriela, what I at least tried to communicate during the Analyst Day is that we have a number of different motions to acquire new customers. And we are continuing to make investments in all of those motions that we think are over the long term going to drive real leverage on the sales and marketing side. So we talked about a number of them at the Analyst Day. We're investing in the data and systems that are really designed to improve rent efficiency that helps a lot of this all-bound motion that Yamini is talking about. We're continuing to invest in our product-led freemium motion. We've been doing that for a number of years, and we still think there's a lot of runway there. And we're investing in linear growth opportunities by commerce, right? And so all of those are long-term bets for us that will take time to impact the P&L, but will ultimately drive nice leverage in our go-to-market.  In the more near-term, we do have a number of plays that are focused on driving increased productivity in the sales organization. Again, Yamini talked about a number of these. We have invested pretty aggressively in sales enablement. We're arming both sales teams and also our customer success teams with TCO playbooks that really helps them engage customers in a relevant way at the moment. We're leaning into the partner channel that's always been a successful channel and it's even more important when we see sort of upmarket more complicated multiproduct deals. And we're really looking at our own marketing organization to drive efficiencies in top-of-funnel demand investment. So all of those things we believe can translate into higher sales productivity even in this more difficult environment. Yes, you cut out a little bit, and I think you were asking whether or not elongated deal cycles were seen across both new customers and existing customers. The answer we are seeing elongated sales cycles everywhere. And so there isn't anything that I would necessarily call out other than what Yamini has already talked about, which is the action is just higher across the board. I mean, you are exactly right. The investments and experiments we're doing at the low end with our freemium motion and product-led growth are the key drivers for our quarter-over-quarter uptick in new customer additions. Yeah. Thank you, Michael. I mean in truth, the trend that we're seeing this quarter and the KPIs are a continuation of some of the trends that we've been seeing for a while, particularly in ASRPC, our strength in installed base selling is very much aligned with the platform value that you are hearing from Yamini at that professional and enterprise. And that is what is enabling us to continue to grow ASRPC even with the larger customer ads at the low end. Why don't I \u2013 I'll take that. I think if you were paying attention on the call, we definitely spent a lot of time talking about the challenging environment in which we're operating, and that is certainly reflected in the Q4 guidance. In addition, you highlight FX that is also an incremental headwind for us into Q4. We called out $4 million of incremental headwind as a result of foreign exchange movements. And so it's really both of those things that are contributing to our Q4 guidance. We are assuming that the environment stays about how it is operating today. And as always, we want to make sure that we can \u2013 we're confident in our ability to deliver even if it gets just a little bit worse from here."

            "name": "Yamini Rangan",
            "content": "Thank you so much, Chuck, and welcome to everyone joining us on the call today. Q3 was another solid quarter for HubSpot with revenue growing 38% year-over-year in constant currency. We added over 8,000 net new customers in the quarter, growing our customer base to nearly 160,000 globally, representing 24% growth year-over-year. These strong results reflect our focus on innovation and execution. Our connected platform is clearly driving value for customers, especially as they look to increase efficiencies, while lowering the total cost of ownership during the period of uncertainty. HubSpot continues to be a mission-critical platform for our customers as they depend on us to stay connected with their customers. On the last call, I spoke about the launch of CMS Free and moving marketing automation down into our start-up year. These plays, combined with our focused go-to-market initiatives, drove strong customer adoption and multihub momentum in the quarter. Before I get into some of the trends we're seeing in the business more broadly, I want to reflect on a recent milestone for HubSpot, which was our annual inbound event in September. This year, as you know, we hosted INBOUND in-person in Boston as well as online and had tens of thousands of attendees from all over the world join us. It was clearly a week to remember with incredible speakers and fantastic opportunities to connect with our customers, partners and community. I know many of you attended as well. So thank you again for joining us. I left INBOUND feeling more energized than ever about HubSpot's future. Through my conversations with customers and partners, it becomes even more clear that we are well-positioned to drive long-term durable growth. And there are three key reasons for this. First, we have a unique opportunity to help our customers with solving the crisis of disconnection. I spoke at INBOUND about the prices our customers are facing as a result of disconnected systems, disconnected customers and disconnection from their peers. To solve this crisis, our customers need to be able to seamlessly connect their data, connect with their customers and with each other, all in one place. That's exactly what we've been building at HubSpot with our connected customer platform. We already see the value customers are getting from being able to connect their entire front office. For example, take GrowthLab Financial, a financial services company. Their growth was limited by disconnected tools and a legacy CRM platform. Without a central platform, their team spent hour's manually tracking prospects and didn't have the insights they needed to optimize their growth. They consolidated onto the HubSpot CRM platform with Marketing Hub, Sales Hub and Service Hub. GrowthLab now uses automation to boost conversion and shorten deal cycles, and leverage the CRM data to get insights on revenue attribution, so they can make more data-driven decisions. Since implementing HubSpot, GrowthLab Financial doubled their revenue and saved a significant amount of time eliminating manual tasks. This is just one great example of how scaling companies can grow better with HubSpot's connected CRM. The second reason we're well-positioned is that our market opportunity is large, expanding and underserved. We operate in massive underserved markets that are forecasted to grow to over $70 billion by 2027. Within this market, we have multiple levers to drive durable long-term growth. Our land and expand motion is working with a majority of our customers trying to treat product before purchasing. And our pathways for expansion have diversified with the breadth and depth we have added in our product. We're also launching into new product categories like payments and commerce, which will continue to open up new avenues for future growth at HubSpot. Even in the weeks since INBOUND, we have a number of new exciting features in private beta, including payment schedules and native invoicing. We're encouraged by the long-term opportunity to help B2B companies transform their buying processes and sell easily online. Finally, our product innovation is cranking. We announced over 80 new product enhancements at INBOUND to meet our customer's evolving needs and help them optimize for connection. Two product highlights where our new campaigns 2.0 tool and customer journey analytics, both are crafted to give businesses a more unified view of their customers experience, and bring data together for deeper insights. We're thrilled to see the positive feedback from data so far. As we look ahead, we're focused on maintaining the pace of innovation, so we can drive even more value for customers and emerge stronger as the connected platform of choice for the mid-market. I'm energized by the opportunity we have, to solve the crisis of disconnection for our customers, serve mega markets and continue to drive the pace of product innovation in order to set ourselves apart. Next, I want to talk about the demand environment, we see today and reiterate our playbook for managing through it. Last quarter, I talked about the demand trends we were seeing in the business through the end of July, including a lengthening of deal cycles, and more decision-makers involved in deals. Since then, the macro environment has become incrementally more challenging. We see two clear trends in this environment based on our customer and prospect conversations. On one hand, deals are taking longer to close. There are more decision-makers involved, more approval layers and budgets are tighter. We continue to see this across the geographies and segments we serve. On the other hand, HubSpot is emerging as a platform of choice to help customers get through these uncertain times. Our customers need more leads, better conversions and better customer experience. But they need to do it all with less. Our value proposition of easy-to-buy, easy-to-use and easy to build, resonates even more now as customers are looking to consolidate their tech stack. Despite the softer macro environment, I'm confident in HubSpot's playbook for resilient growth through the cycle. Our playbook is based on three core principles that served us well during the pandemic and again, through the macro volatility this year. We talked about these principles last quarter, but there was repeating. The first is solve for the customer, even during uncertain times, one thing we're certain of is that, solving for the customer is good business. What this means right now is that, we are helping customers understand the value of consolidating onto a connected platform and the impact it can have on their total cost of ownership. We're also providing even more functionality at the lower end. We moved high-value features like marketing automation, down to starter, and helping early-stage businesses get online with three CRM and CMS. These plays are resonating with our customers, and you can see it in our results. Second, we will continue to invest in innovation to emerge stronger. We're being more prudent with our hiring as well as discretionary spend, but remain committed to investing in innovation. In fact, we're so thrilled to see that our product investments resulted in HubSpot being recognized as a leader in the Magic Quadrant for B2B marketing automation platforms by Gartner this past quarter. Moving forward, we'll continue to invest and innovate and functionality to help scaling companies optimized for customer connection. Lastly, we execute with focus. For us, it is all about controlling the controllables. We're focused on driving expansion through cross-sell and upsell motions and the percentage of ARR from customers with 3-plus hubs grew nicely within this quarter. We're executing on our bimodal strategy with strength in both net customer additions at the lower end and momentum among larger customers, driving double-digit ASRPC growth. And we're continuing to balance growth and profitability through more measured hiring and tighter control of discretionary spreads. Heading into the end of the year, I feel energized. We have a clear opportunity ahead to drive value for our customers. Our teams are focused on execution, and we have the right playbook in place to drive growth in this uncertain environment. With that, I'll hand it over to Kate. Thank you so much, Kate. I want to close by emphasizing that HubSpot is operating from a position of strength. We've built a robust connected customer platform that is meeting the evolving needs of our customers. We have a strong balance sheet and an incredible team and company culture that allows us to attract and retain top talent. We're thrilled for HubSpot to be ranked number one in employee happiness among top rated large companies by comparably just last month. Our culture and people continue to be a competitive advantage for HubSpot. Looking ahead, we will continue to adapt to the realities of the environment without losing sight of our mission to become the number one CRM platform for scaling companies. Thank you so much to our customers. our partners, our employees and shareholders. With that, operator, let's open up the call for questions. Yes. Thanks a lot, Brian, for the question. Yes, we are seeing many of the same trends in our customer base that we saw in Q2. It was just a bit more intensified in Q3. We saw the longer deal cycles that we talked about in Q2. We saw more decision makers getting involved in deals and more approvals needed. Typically, we will talk to the VP of Marketing Sales for approval. Now we're talking to the CFO, CEO and sometimes even the Board. Product evaluations are taking longer as buyers are generally much more risk averse and the budgets are tight now. So look, I think we're seeing a lot of things that are very much in line with what you've heard from other companies this quarter, the overall environment is just incrementally more challenging than it was in Q2. Now having said that, Brian, we continue to win and our value proposition resonates really well in this environment. Customers want a clear value case and they want to clear business case for driving efficiency. So we're working with our champions. We're working with our point of contact with the customers to be able to articulate the business case, and then we're able to present to the C suite and Board. Our customers want ease of use and ease of implementation, because the combination of those two lead to time to value, and that's what matters in this environment. Now both of those, ease of use and ease of implementation, they both historically been core differentiators for HubSpot and continues to be a differentiator now, and it's really important in this environment. And then finally, I'd say that customers are looking to standardize on a platform. They're looking to eliminate point solutions. They are looking to reduce their budgets and they're looking to us to be able to bring more data and have a single platform, we're now no longer nice to have solution, we're just becoming a must-have mission-critical solution for our customers. So all of those are resonating within our customer base, and you can see that within our results. Now look, looking forward, we don't have a crystal ball, but we expect these conditions to persist in Q4 and possibly even into 2023. We're navigating through all of these choppy waters from a position of strength and will remain exceptionally focused on executing the playbook that I just walked through. Yes. Brian, I think the combination of marketing and sales is becoming exceptionally more important right now. When I talk to customers, they are expecting much more from their marketing and sales for organizations. They are expecting more leads, better lead quality, better conversion, better visibility into the pipeline and they want all of this for less, right?  And that means we're definitely seeing the value of having a connected marketing and sales hub solution that's what is really key within our customer base. And so, when we talk about multihub, most of our multi-hub have Sales Hub and Marketing Hub involved, and we're helping our customers kind of now to get through this environment as well. Yes, Mark, thanks a lot for your question. Look, from a segmentation strategy, we're very much focused on the 2 to 2,000 segment. So for us, the upper bounds of the segment continued to be 200 to 2,000 person employee company. The only thing is we're winning our fair share within that market. And as you rightly pointed out, over the past couple of years, we have invested going upmarket with features like custom objects at inbound we announced more than 80 new enhancements and features across the entire platform and a number of these enhancements and features are really driving better UI customization, better data management, advanced permissioning, granular ability for admins to control the environment. So a lot of the features have enabled us to win our fair share going up market and in this environment, one of the things that we see is customers, as I just talked about, care about better visibility, but they also care about better time to value and cost-effective solution. So going back to really the fundamental value proposition of HubSpot were easy to use, but we have very powerful features, and that makes us exceptionally competitive in that tough market. So we're remaining true to the segmentation and winning our fair share of that market. Yes. It should be very clear. What we saw in Q3 was just an incrementally more challenging environment than what we saw in Q2. And specifically, budgets are tight and every approval is being carefully considered. And because of that, the approval processes are longer, customers are spending a little bit more time getting a value case delivered to their fee level for approval and sometimes even going to the board. So, we're continuing to see that pressure. We're also seeing the need for a crystal care plan to deliver value, which means more time to understand implementation plans, user adoption plans, more times to understand the training plans. And all of this means that there is just a lot more rigor, more demos, and more conversations. So, we definitely are seeing incrementally more challenging environment from a macro perspective. Having said that, like we talked about, we've put in some place from being focused on the customer and those plays continue to work at the bottom end, which is where you see the strength in net adds and our multi-hub value proposition is resonating. And so we'll continue to work through this choppy environment. Samad, thanks a lot, and I will double down and emphasize, I think, congratulations to the entire company, both in the product and flywheel and the entire company for executing in a very tough macro environment. Look, on the demand side, if you consider a year ago, it was primarily all inbound. So, with a lot of people raising hands and coming to us mostly qualified. And so it was fairly quick to take that kind of a qualified lead and convert it into a customer win. What we are beginning to see is that, that level of inbound has changed. And right now, it's a combination of that and our customer success team, our sales organization, going to new customers and going through prospects and having conversations about HubSpot. So, it's a combination of people raising their hands and coming to us. And that part of it has slowed down a little bit. So, it's us going back to our installed base and having conversations on how we can add more value. So certainly, from a demand perspective, we see a pretty big shift from last year and somewhat of a shift from the first half of the year. Having said that, what I'd say is like there's just a higher bar to action within the pipeline. There's more conversations, more approvals and more demos that are needed to get to action. And so the way, I would characterize, it is demand has slowed. We've compensated it by going out and proactively having conversations to the customer base, and it takes much longer for us to close, and we continue to be very, very focused on executing in this environment. Yeah. Really good question. Certainly, more CEOs, CFOs, CTOs than we have dealt with in the past. And it is \u2013 while the conversations take longer, they are really good conversations. And the way, I'd characterize it is that when we talk to the C we've written our customer organizations, there are a few things that matter to them. First is time to value. They really care about how quickly they're going to get to value and how their teams are going to see the impact. And so part of it us having a clear articulation of value as well as cost savings to the C-suite. The second is really talking about the value of a consolidated platform. There -- over the past couple of years, a lot of these companies have ended up buying disconnected point solutions and that's costing them. And so when we have conversations with CEOs and CFOs, we talk about how we can help them with eliminating some of these point solutions and consolidating and seeing the value of a consolidated platform and that certainly resonates. Now, on the second part of your question, this has meant that we've doubled down on enablement for our sales team for our customer success team as well as the partner organization. We've rolled out TCO playbook as well as value playbook so that they can bring these conversations earlier in the sales process. They can proactively talk about how we can help them get to time to value as well as cost savings. And that part of the enablement is something that we're doubling down, and we're doubling down in terms of execution as well. So, absolutely see all of those within the pipeline. Yeah. Rishi, the elimination of foreign solutions is a place where customers look to as their budget gets super constrained, right? And again, an example in the prepared remarks of one of our customers kind of consolidating, there are many more like that, that we're having conversations. We have a ERP software solution organization in North America. So we're using multiple tools for marketing as well as their sales efforts, and all of that was extremely manual siloed and so they looked to us. And over a period of time, we had multiple conversations in initially started with Marketing Hub and then extended to marketing and sales and eliminating six tools as we were looking to help them consolidate their go-to-market stack. And so that led to not only this improved marketing efforts, but also reducing their overall spend. So a number of customers. Now, I'm not saying that these are easy. I'm not saying that, these are quick because that's not happening within this environment. But when we start with either marketing or sales, we do have the opportunity to engage with our customers strategically and talk about their entire stack and how we can help them consolidate their stack. Gabriela, multiple questions there. I try to answer those, and I'm sure Kate can jump in there as well. In terms of the demand, we did see an incrementally more challenging environment from a demand perspective in Q3 than we saw in Q4. It's a new level, it's not getting worse. It is an incrementally more challenging demand environment than Q2, and all of the things that we talked about, more conversations, more time to get approval, more demos. All of that adds to that incrementally challenging environment. And when I talked about last year, almost everything that we did was just inbound where we had customers coming in, was in their hands coming to us, wanting digital transformation. Right now, that is not the kind of tailwind that you can hear from all of the macro commentary at abating even other peers within the industry. It's a combination of some of the inbound demand, the digital trend is continuing, but it is kind of metered by the cyclical macro trends. And so partly, our teams have to go engage with our customers and identify opportunities for them to save cost or consolidate on a platform or continue on the digital journey. And yeah, I think it's cyclical in nature. I think it's based on what is currently happening from a macro environment perspective. And the overall structural need for digital and the belief that our customers have in digital transformation has not changed. Kate, do you want to add anything on the latter part of the cash question? Yes. Let me answer the first one, and then maybe Kate can answer the second part. So, international revenue grew 44% in constant currency in Q3. That's pretty good in the macro environment like this. As we mentioned before, even starting in Q1 and certainly in Q2, the trend for longer deal cycles started in EMEA. But however, what we're seeing now is the macro environment is just broad-based. We're now seeing the trends that's starting at kind of across all segments and all geos. So, really not a notable difference in EMEA versus North America for now. Yes, Parker, really good question. I think, look, no one is immune to the macro headwinds that we are overall seeing. So, I think if VPA partners will also see it. Now, having said that, we have about 6,000 partners within our overall ecosystem and they contribute about 40% of our revenue. Over the last couple of years, we have invested pretty heavily in the partners in terms of enabling the partners in terms of helping them kind of really transform from being a marketing agency to a full-fledged CRM implementer and being able to take our upmarket customers and drive sales distal for of market customers. And I'd say that is working really well. Partner contribution to total rep-driven MRR, both what they're sourcing as well as what they are co-selling with HubSpot is doing well. It was pretty high in Q2, and it continued to be pretty high in Q3, and that's sign that partners are very engaged and they are moving on the journey with us as we really provide a platform for scaling companies. So, we're happy with how our partners are executing and they're executing in a tough environment. So, huge thanks and shout out to them. Hey Sarah, thanks for that. I'm going to maybe just started and then Dharmesh, feel free to jump in here as well. Look, the conversations right now are all around driving efficiency, driving time to value, and getting results that can impact the outcomes in the near-term, right? And as we think about that, omni-channel marketing is really important. When I have conversations with CMOs mean CEOs, who within customers, they clearly understand that it cannot be just one channel. And so a lot of it is omni-channel marketing. And this is why what we announced and launched at inbound, which our teams worked really hard on customer journey analytics and campaigns, 2.0 functionality. Both of those really meet the needs of where the marketing organization is expected to step up and deliver right now. And that's the kind of conversations that we are having. In general, a lot of marketing spend is around driving direct impact to revenue and pipeline in the short term and away from things like ad spend or even spend or brand spend. That is what we are hearing based on talking to customers. Well, I want to do a big call out to HubSpotters globally. They are just so focused on executing. So thank my heart call thanks to all the employees and all things to customers, partners and investors, look forward to talking to you next year."

Now it's my pleasure to turn over the call to HubSpot's Chief Executive Officer, Yamini Rangan. Yamini?\nYamini Rangan: Thank you Chuck, and welcome to everyone joining us on the call. Today, I want to focus on the Q2 results, what\u2019s driving performance and HubSpot\u2019s playbook for driving durable growth over the long-term. First, let\u2019s kick it off with our results this quarter. Q2 was a solid quarter for HubSpot with revenue growing 41% year-over-year in constant currency and total customers growing 25% year-over-year to more than 150,000 globally with more than 50% using multiple HubSpot products. These results were driven by strong product innovation, a deep understanding of what our customers need in order to grow today and focussed execution. As I talked to our customers, it is clear that SMBs need to do more with less as they navigate the current macroeconomic environment. They're looking for ways to consolidate their fragmented tech stack of point solutions, improve efficiencies, and get better visibility into their customers journey. As a result, HubSpot connected, easy to use platform is mission critical for our customers. Let's start with product innovation in the second quarter. We're focused on delivering a world class Front Office platform by investing in our anchor hubs of marketing, sales and service and by innovating with our newer hubs. We made important strides in both areas in Q2. Last time we talked, I shared the exciting news, that marketing hub had just surpassed a billion dollars in annual recurring revenue. In Q2, we unlocked marketing automation features in the start up here, so that marketers can deliver a personalized touch without draining personal time. Teams can now engage and convert customers faster by personalizing and segmenting marketing efforts and automating routine tasks. This unlocks tremendous value for the start up here. On the upper end of the market, we're increasing marketing hub enterprise pricing in September, to match the additional value we've been delivering to customers over the last few years with more sophisticated functionality, like revenue attribution reporting, AI powered AB testing, and more. These changes are consistent with our pricing and packaging strategy of driving high value features down to starter, while fueling innovation at the higher tiers. During our last call, we had also just re-launched service hub, and over the past quarter, we've been pleased to see customer usage of features like tickets, and inbox tools increase. In Q2, we further enhance service hub by launching inbound calling, so that customers can provide real time service and engagement over the phone. With these developments, we're making meaningful progress with service hub to empower our customers to deliver an exceptional customer experience at scale. Another big product milestone in Q2 was the launch of CMS Hub Free. Why Free CMS now? Well, every business today starts with a website to connect with their customers. But too often, they're forced to choose between free content management systems with limited customization or robust solutions that are cost prohibitive, especially in this environment. What differentiates CMS Hub from other website building tools is that it's powered by a Free CRM platform. That means companies can easily build a beautiful website to attract visitors and leverage CRM to nurture that business across their entire front office, all on HubSpot. That combination is powerful and unique. As part of the launch in June, we also introduced CMS website themes in our marketplace to give Business Builders the tools and the assets to get started online. As a result, we've seen nearly 4000 CMS free signups in the first month since launch, and 110% increase in marketplace transactions. I'm really excited that these results and the large green space opportunity to drive premium growth with CMS Free. This pace of product innovation in the second quarter demonstrates that HubSpot is making meaningful progress to become the platform of choice for scaling businesses. Okay, shifting gears, I want to acknowledge that we like a number of companies saw lengthening of deal cycles, and more decision makers getting involved in deals in June. While we cannot predict how the macroeconomic environment will evolve in the second half, I want to share the HubSpot playbook for how we will navigate through the uncertainty in the short term while driving the business towards strong durable growth over the long term. Then in a few minutes, Kate will talk about how we're planning to continue to grow profitability in the software demand environment. One of HubSpot\u2019s trends is that we focus on near term execution while driving a clear long term strategy. During times of uncertainty in the past, we've continued to play strategic bets that will help us and our customers emerge stronger. We did this successfully throughout the pandemic by following three core principles; solving for a customer, sustained investments in product and execute with focus. We're taking the same approach to drive durable growth now. Let me unpack each of these core principles. During the pandemic, solving for the customer was all about helping businesses become digitally enabled. Now, it is about helping customers become digitally powered, by helping them consolidate on a single platform to drive efficiencies. For example, take Sando [ph] design, a digital design branding agency. Before HubSpot their front office consisted of multiple point solutions that are cobbled together by different departments. Our team helped them consolidate all of their point\u2019s solutions and moved their entire front office onto the HubSpot platform. Before implementing HubSpot, it took them months to create landing pages and email campaigns. Now it just takes a few days. Additionally, Sando design has saved thousands of dollars by getting rid of point solutions. This is exactly how our customers are reducing costs, increasing efficiency and growing better by consolidating on HubSpot. The second principle in our playbook is to sustain investments in product. Throughout the pandemic, we maintain our investment in product innovation. This enabled us to create levers for long term growth with platform and payments. And now we're continuing to build on that foundation. In the second quarter, we enhanced our platform for our customers with more sophisticated means by releasing new sales hub features that enable CRM customization and crafted data management. We also continue to expand HubSpot app ecosystem, with our integration catalog growing nearly 40% year-over-year. Moving forward, we will continue to invest in our developer\u2019s strategy to drive customization and extensibility of the HubSpot platform. We also made meaningful progress in payments by launching new features including paid meetings, forms and links. In addition to recurring ACH and payments object. These features are helping our customers unlock the power of a commerce enabled CRM. Take the non-profit trade group, international carwash association as an example. They're disconnected payment and fulfillment paths were creating customer friction and lots of manual processing. They were already using HubSpot marketing, sales and service hub when they decided to implement payments to connect the buyer\u2019s journey. Since adopting payments, they've increased e-commerce sales by 400% and set up the fulfillment process by nearly twofold. This is a powerful example of how B2B businesses can sell online and create new revenue streams with HubSpot. Looking ahead, we plan to sustain key investments in products so that we can emerge stronger as a platform of choice. The third and final principle is to execute with focus. Like every business, there are many factors outside of our control due to uncertainty in the macro environment. So we will control the controllables. We're focused on driving both direct and partner enablement, reaching our customers with relevant TCO playbooks and continuing to build a foundation for excellent execution. These principles have helped guide HubSpot to the position of strength we are in today. The long term drivers of our business remained solid, as HubSpot continues to be mission critical for our customers. And we are making meaningful progress towards becoming the number one CRM platform for scaling companies. With that, I'll hand it over to Kate to talk about our financial results and our strategy for driving profitable growth.\nKate Bueker: Thanks Yamini. Let's turn to our second quarter 2022 financial results. Second quarter revenue grew 41% year-over-year in constant currency and 36% on an as reported basis. Q2 subscription revenue grew 37% year-over-year, while services and other revenue decreased 10% on an as reported basis. Domestic revenue grew 35% year-over-year in Q2, while international revenue growth was 49% in constant currency, and 37% as reported. International revenue represented 46% of total revenue in Q2. We added approximately 7100 net new customers in the quarter, bringing our total customer count to over 150,000 up 25% year-over-year. Average subscription revenue per customer grew 14% year-over-year in constant currency and 10% on an as reported basis to $11,200. This was driven by continued strength and multi hub adoption. We saw healthy net revenue retention rates in Q2 on a continued strong foundation and customer retention and nice cross sell and upsell activity. Deferred revenue as of the end of June was $474 million or 31% increase year-over-year. Calculated billings were $433 million in Q2, growing 39% year-over-year in constant currency, and 30% as reported. The remainder of my comments will refer to non-GAAP measures. Second quarter gross margin was 82%, up one point year-over-year. Subscription gross margin was 85% in Q2 while services and other gross margin was negative 42%. Second quarter operating margin was 7%, down two point\u2019s year-over-year. There was approximately a one point headwind to operating profit margin from FX in the quarter. Net income in the second quarter was $22 million or $0.44 per fully diluted share. At the end of the second quarter, we had just over 7000 employees up 41% year-over-year. CapEx including capitalized software development cost was $90 million, or 4% of revenue in Q2, and free cash flow in the quarter was $22 million or 5% of revenue. Finally, our cash and marketable securities totaled $1.4 million at the end of June. As Yamini highlighted we saw a softening in demand in June, marked by lengthening deal cycles, and more decision makers and deals. In light of this increased macroeconomic pressure, we are taking several actions to drive a continued balance between growth and profitability. We had a strong first half of hiring and have a talented team in place to execute against our strategic goals, which gives us the opportunity to slow our hiring in the second half of the year. We will continue to maintain investments in product and engineering and grow revenue generating sales headcount in the second half, but we will moderate headcount growth in other areas of the business. In addition, we are taking steps to pullback T&E facilities and other discretionary expenses in the second half of 2022. Before I turn to our outlook, I want to highlight the impact of foreign currency translation on our as reported financial results. U.S. Dollar strengthened sharply throughout Q2 and into July, creating a meaningful incremental headwind to our 2022 as reported revenue and non-GAAP operating profit relative to the guidance we provided on our May earnings call. At current spot rates, we now expect FX to negatively impact full year 2022 revenue growth by six points up from our prior expectation of a five point headwind. Finally, our guidance assumes continued macroeconomic headwinds throughout the remainder of the year. And with that, let's review our guidance for the third quarter and full year of 2022. For the third quarter, total as reported revenue is expected to be in the range of $425 million to $426 million, up 25% year-over-year at the midpoint. We expect FX to be an eight point headwind as reported revenue growth in the third quarter. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be between $31 million and $32 million. Non-GAAP, diluted net income per share is expected to be between $0.50 and $0.52. This assumes 51.0 million fully diluted shares outstanding. And for the full year of 2022, total as reported revenue is now expected to be in the range of $1.69 billion to $1.695 billion, up 30% year-over-year at the midpoint. As I mentioned, we now expect FX to be a six point headwind to as reported revenue growth for the full year of 2022. Non-GAAP operating income is now expected to be between $143 million and $144 million, which includes an incremental $5 million FX headwind versus our prior forecast. Non-GAAP diluted net income per share is now expected to be between $2.28 and $2.30. This assumes 51.1 million fully diluted shares outstanding. As you adjust your models, keep in mind the following; we expect CapEx as a percentage of revenue to be roughly 5% and free cash flow to be about $200 million for the full year of 2022, including an incremental headwind of approximately $10 million from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to our prior forecast. And with that, I'll hand things back over to Yamini for her closing remarks.\nYamini Rangan: Thank you so much, Kate. I want to close by saying we are confident in HubSpot\u2019s future despite the headwinds we are seeing from the macro environment. We have a clear strategy to drive long term durable and profitable growth and award winning culture and an incredible team solving for our customers every single day. I want to thank our employees globally for their adaptability and commitment to our mission. Lastly, I look forward to seeing many of you at our analysts day as part of our INBOUND 2022 event on September 7. With that operator, please open up the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]Our first question today comes from Samad Samana from Jefferies. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nSamad Samana: Hey, good afternoon. Let me start by saying, if we step back, it's just an awesome performance to deliver the constant currency growth that you are with everything that's going on with the macro backdrop. I mean, 39% for billings, and 42% for revenue growth is extremely impressive. So just wanted to get that out of the way but maybe Yamini, I wanted to double click on your commentary around what's happening with what you've seen in demand environment. So just it's shifted for HubSpot and a number of other companies since you gave the guidance for 2Q and you updated that, for your guidance. Can you maybe walk through the linearity of demand trends that you saw on the quarter and what you're maybe seeing more broadly across your business in real time today?\nYamini Rangan: Yes, thanks a lot Samad for that question. We are seeing two trends. First of all, these cycles are lengthening and more decision makers, specifically CFOs and CEOs are getting pulled into deals for approval. Now, in early May, we were one of the first companies to transparently share that we saw deals taking longer in Europe. And in June, we saw these trends become more broad based across our segments and the GEOs [ph] that we serve. Now, while these trends will have impact in the short term, and it is reflected within our guidance, we are confident in HubSpot\u2019s long term growth opportunity for a couple of reasons. First off, why these deals are taking longer? They are coming down to platform and multi hub decisions. SMBs are figuring out how to spend effectively, and they're looking at HubSpot as the platform to run their front office. So we see deals close favorably, but taking a little bit longer. And second, we're not a discretionary point solutions. We\u2019re the backbone for small and medium businesses. All these businesses still need to market, they need to sell, they need to serve as their customers. And HubSpot is a system of record and engagement for customer data. So we're mission critical, and they're sticky. So while we're seeing the demand trend softened a bit in the short term, we are very confident in our strategy and long term growth. Thanks for that question, Samad.\nSamad Samana: Very helpful. And then Kate, maybe if I could ask you a quick follow up. Just as I think about the -- the Yamani talked about what you're seeing in terms of deals, etcetera. But maybe could you help me get some color on what you're seeing in terms of retention trends within the install base? And if there's been any change or anything worth calling out what you're seeing with your existing customers? And maybe what you're assuming in the guidance around retention?\nKate Bueker: Yes, sure thing. As you know, we think about retention in two ways, we have a growth retention. That is the base of what we then ultimately have as net revenue retention, which happens after the net upsell. Net retention in our quarter was comfortably above that 110 target that we've been talking about, despite really the more difficult environment that we saw towards the end of the quarter. I think the good news there is that underneath that the growth retention remained really solid in the high 80s, which is the range that we've been talking about for a year or two now. And then on the net retention side, we had another quarter of really strong install base selling, which, in particular, edition upgrades and cross sell really led the way for us here in Q2. In the back half of the year, it's a good question. I would expect that net revenue retention will hang in there, I would call it around 110 for Q3, and Q4.\nSamad Samana: Great, really appreciate it. And again, very impressive results in a tough backdrop.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Arjun Bhatia from William Blair. Your line is open.\nArjun Bhatia: Perfect. Thank you so much for taking my questions. Maybe just a follow on onto that. Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing, in terms of additions to the pipeline and velocity of deals that are being added? Understandably, it's taking a little bit longer as companies are scrutinizing spend more, but is the shape of what's coming into the pipeline changing at all or the products that customers are looking at changing? And if you can give any color on that? That'd be super helpful.\nYamini Rangan: Yes, thanks a lot, Arjun for the question. So look, I think the best way to think about is the more discreet changes are deal cycles, elongating and more decision makers kind of getting involved as they assess their budget as they do a double click and scrutinize their investments. And this is not just happening in one part, it's kind of happening across geo segments and industries and I there's not anything more specific, the BC in terms of pipeline, assets close to through from the top of the funnel all the way down. Now, having said that, as I talked to customers hear from customers around the quarter, there are a couple of feeds, right. Customers are looking for clear revenue impact, so the closer the solution is to driving the impact, the faster the customer decision. So from our perspective, we are leading with a clear impact from having marketing sales service tied together. The other part that's changing is that customers want to be able to do more with less, that means they are okay giving up on point solutions. They're looking for more platform level solutions that are very cost effective. So we're leading with our CRM platform as well as multi help value proposition to have very clear TCO savings decision for our customers. And so that's how I would think about the color.\nArjun Bhatia: Alright, that's very helpful. Thank you very much.\nChuck MacGlashing: Operator, I think we'll take the next question. Appears that we're having some technical difficulties here, just hang with us? Hey, Gabriela [ph], it looks like your line is open. Can you hear us?\nUnidentified Analyst: Oh, great. Hi. Good afternoon. Yeah, I can hear you.\nChuck MacGlashing: Like, I'm going to be monitoring the call from here, though for your question.\nUnidentified Analyst: I have one Yamini and one for Kate. So for Yamini, the comments that you were just making on driving to a clear revenue impact. I'm curious if you could share with us any nuances you're seeing within the front office categories? Are there some areas that you feel more ripe for consolidation than others in the context of perhaps some of your company's specific product cycles? And then the follow up question is for Kate. So you mentioned earlier that continued macro headwinds being incorporated into guidance? Could you share a little bit about what you're assuming about the trend that you're looking at June and extrapolating that things get worse? So you're looking at June and assuming things stay the same at the squishy June levels and a color that would be helpful?\nYamini Rangan: Yes, thanks a lot, Gabriela. I'll start with the first one, which is, there any color specifically around products or segments? If not, I will say broadly, as we look at how customers are focused on [Indiscernible] they are deprioritizing -- that is not closely tied to revenue, examples of that could be like events, and brands and adds them, those are areas that they're deprioritizing. And they're prioritizing, then that clearly drive pipelines, and it's closer to revenue. And examples of that are, sales marketing that continues to help them grow. And so, I think it's really a question of where they are prioritizing. I think more broadly speaking, there is look at, how many points solutions do we have? Do we need all of these? And is there an opportunity to eliminate some of these points solutions and consolidate on a platform like HubSpot? And that's certainly a value proposition that we're leaning into, for both monitoring hub sales, as well as our entire suite sales. I'll pass it to Kate for the second half.\nKate Bueker: Yes, sure. In terms of guidance, I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we're factoring in a continuation of the current weaker environment. That really means like we saw a weakness through June and July, and we're assuming that that continues through the rest of the year. So we're also assuming that foreign currency rates stay in and around current spot rates, which, as you know, is a one point incremental headwind to our growth for 2022. And we feel really good about our ability to deliver against that guidance. And the continued weaker environment we see today or even in something a little bit worse than that.\nUnidentified Analyst: That makes sense. Congrats on the quarter.\nOperator: Our next question is from Alex Zukin from Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nAlex Zukin: Hey, guys, can you hear me okay?\nYamini Rangan: We can.\nAlex Zukin: Perfect. I guess I want to ask about just the magnitude of incremental deterioration that that's kind of assumed in the guide, maybe for subscription constant currency subscription revenue for the year. And then any, is there anything in payment terms that you're seeing, lengthening, that's impacting cash flow this year? Or, and or, linearity or seasonality of billings in the second half?\nKate Bueker: Yes, maybe I'll dive in there. What we decided in May, Alex are the midpoint of our guide was 32.5% growth for full year revenue, and on an as reported basis. And our update is for 30% of the midpoint on an as reported basis, which is a 2.5% slowdown. One point of that is from FX. And then the other point and a half is associated with macro and business performance. I would like to remind you that our guidance includes six points of FX impact for the full year up from five. So our constant currency revenue growth has moved from 37.5% to 36% growth for 2022. And then, in terms of payment terms, we really haven't seen anything. Of note, I think the thing that we've seen most in sort of new deals is exactly what Yamini was talking about, which is a bit of a lengthening in the sales cycle, and more decision makers really getting involved before things are signed.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brent Bracelin from Piper Sandler. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nBrent Bracelin: Thank you, Yamini for you here that the growth equation is benefited from both strong new customer ads and strong ASRPC growth over the last couple of years. As you think about entering a new period here where customer growth starts to slow just on the length in sales cycles, can you continue to drive ASRPC growth higher? I asked that because we are in a period here where we're starting to hear more narrative around vendor consolidation, which might play to larger deal bundles, just trying to think through that equation as a potential offset to slowing customer net ads.\nKate Bueker: Yes, maybe this is Kate; maybe I will dive on in around KPIs. I think you've heard us say, over a long period of time that we see a lot of opportunity, both in continuing to drive new customer acquisition, and also in our ability to sell more of HubSpot into our install base. And, I think that the KPIs we saw in Q2 really demonstrated that balance pretty nicely. We added, 7000 plus new customers, and we were able to grow double digit, both income to currency and on an as reported basis our ASRPC. That being said, I think, as you look forward, and we've talked a lot about the moderating macro environment, we'll probably see a little bit of a moderation, similar to what we're seeing in revenue across our KPIs. And so we don't really give guidance there. But we do think we would anticipate kind of back half of the year or something that looks like 6000 to 7000 new customers added in Q3 and Q4 and ASRPC growth that looks closer to the 10% and of the double digit in constant currency.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Keith Bachman from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nKeith Bachman: Yes, thank you. I want to segway on that. Could you talk a little bit more about the price increases? I don't think you mentioned that percent. What is there a range that you could share with us on how prices are increasing? Where would that where would that be? And then how would that flow into both the ASRPC and/or revenues more broadly?\nYamini Rangan: Sure, Keith, I'll take the first part of the question, and then I'll have Kate comment on the second part, which is impact. Well from a pricing perspective, we will stay very consistent with our pricing and packaging philosophy that we have talked to you all about. We pour innovation and build powerful features within the Enterprise tier and over time we will bring those high end features down to professional starter and premium editions. That's been our pricing and packaging philosophy for a while. When we have added tremendous value, then we look at pricing changes. And that's been very consistent. So what I mentioned in the prepared remarks today is that with marketing com, we've innovated, we've added tons of incremental value over the last few years. And the last time we increased price for marketing hub enterprise was inbound 2018. So that was like four years ago. And they're certainly added a lot of value. So what we did in July is that we announced an upcoming modest increase in terms of pricing that will be effective, nine one for new customers, it's kind of in that 12% range. And that announcement has gone out, we are tracking the feedback from customers, and it has been fine so far. So broadly, we'll continue to stay focused on driving a lot of value with our products. And when we deliver value to customers, we look at pricing and packaging decisions and changes. Kate, I will pass it to you.\nKate Bueker: Yes, sure. In terms of impact, I think it will take time for us to recognize the full impact of the incremental price on marketing hub enterprise as customers go through the renewal process. And as we add new customers, any impacts for 2022 is incorporated in the guidance we shared earlier.\nOperator: We now turn to Michael Turits from KeyBanc. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nMichael Turits: Hey, I'm going to start with Kate and then we\u2019ll see Yamini. So Kate, just the cash flow guide came down more than the EBIT guide came down. So is there some impact there from [Indiscernible] lengthening decision cycles in terms of working capital? And then and then Yamini I have this really high level question. But we've sort of all agonized over Oh, front office's Great. Oh, no, the pull forward? Oh, no, no, it seems to be back. And at least in core, you're doing well. So I'm wondering how you're really thinking about how demand for a front office for your customer set has evolved? Let's call it over the last two quarters.\nKate Bueker: Yes, Michael, I\u2019ll start. You're right. The reduction of the free cash flow estimate for the full year incorporates two things. One is an incremental $10 million headwind from foreign exchange on cash flow, and the other is in the demand environment reflected in our revenue guidance.\nYamini Rangan: Yes. And, and so Michael, I'll pick the second part of the question in terms of how we see the demand for front office evolve. Look, I mean, coming straight out of the pandemic, it was just massive tailwind. Every small medium business that needed to get connected to their customers needed some kind of digital marketing or sales or support. And so I'd say that was just acceleration for adopting new solutions. And I think now it is much more about driving productivity and making sure that it is very close to revenue impact, and it's also very, very cost effective. So I think the nature of the conversations and therefore the nature of the demand has shifted, but broadly, our SMB customers, they are continuing on their path to digital transformation, the conversations and certainly the rigor with which they look at a purchase decision has changed.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rishi Jaluria from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nRishi Jaluria: Oh, wonderful. Thanks so much for taking my questions. First, I just wanted to start on going back to the price increases. Number one, what has just been the general feedback from customers you've talked to about the upcoming price increases? And I know it's baked into guidance, but should we expect there to be any potential pull forward of business with the expectation of an upcoming price increase? And then I've got a follow up for Kate?\nYamini Rangan: Yes, I'll start with that. I mean, look, I think in terms of the price increase in the feedback, as I mentioned marketing club enterprise has gone through a very, very fast pace of innovation. We've added a tremendous number of features there. I mentioned revenue attribution reporting, but that's just the first of many we've done a lot in terms of omni channel marketing and building a world class marketing solution. So innovations have gone in there, which means our customers understand they use it and they are leveraging it. And we have not increased prices for the last four years. So the feedback from our customers that's going to [Indiscernible] then got it, we get it given the level of innovation. And we'll keep tracking, the feedback from our partners as well as customers. And Kate, I don't know if you want to add more in terms of how we think about flowing this.\nKate Bueker: Yes, I mean, look, I think that all product announcements carry with it some positive impact and momentum, if not internally and externally, but it's not a huge needle mover for us, given the timeline. And it, as I said, it's all already there in the guidance.\nRishi Jaluria: Okay, great. That's, that's helpful. And then Kate, I just wanted to look at the, SPC line. Historically, your stock comp, I think has been pretty responsible and relatively low for a company of their growth profile, but it looks like it's spiked up a lot this quarter to 90% of revenue. And I know there's obviously a lot of moving pieces there, any one time impacts that lead to that big spike and maybe taking a step back. Can you maybe walk us through philosophically how you think about stock comp at HubSpot and kind of the balance of stock versus cash? Thank you.\nKate Bueker: Yes, you're right. So Q2 stock comp expense every year is a high watermark for us as a percentage of revenue, because we do a catch up and expense for two quarters. And so that 19% in Q2 will be the high watermark for 2022. The increase is driven by a few things. One, there's an impact, we had a bunch of notable executive hires over the last six months, and that is that impact. And then the other big change is that we made a shift in our RFQ investing from four years to three years for all of our employees. We think it was an important change for us to make it increase the attractiveness of the RFQ and increase the retentive value of the RFQ. And so those are really the two big drivers of the SPC increase. That's even with those changes; we pay a lot of attention to stock comp as a percentage of revenue. We also pay a lot of attention to dilution. And we look at our management of those relative to our peer companies. And we still compare very well against the software companies in general.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Keith Wise from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nElizabeth Porter: Great, this is Elizabeth Porter on for Keith, thank you so much. Just given the more volatile macro environment, I wanted to see if there was anything you guys are doing to adapt the go-to-market strategy, just more uncertain times, any incremental focus on different customer segments, GEO as a department that might have more durability and spend, for example? Thank you.\nYamini Rangan: Yes, so Elizabeth thanks a lot for the question. In terms of what we are seeing, it's very, very consistent with what I said earlier, there. We saw broad base shifts in terms of the time it takes, but really not that much more. Now, in terms of our go-to-market strategy, think that was an earlier question and how we are adapting, though the place to start, if all this what are the customer conversations focused on. And the customer conversations are focused clearly on revenue impact, or TCO cost savings. That's how the nature has changed and which means, from go-to-market strategy perspective, we're focused on both campaigns as well as arming our direct sales team, the partner organization and our customer success organization with those very specific value messages. Now more broadly, time of shift like this is doubling down on direct and partner enablement, doubling down on the right kinds of messages where we can deliver value to our customers, and overall additional rigor within the sales process and sales execution. That's how I would kind of look at it. I don't know if Kate you have anything else to add?\nKate Bueker: I think you got it.\nOperator: We now turn to Brad Sills from Bank of America Securities. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nBrad Sills: Oh, great. Thanks so much. And I'll echo that congratulations on very solid execution in a tough environment. I wanted to ask about Service Hub first please if I could, it's a major new revamp here. And we're hearing real positive feedback from the challengers to get your perspective on that cycle, please. And then also with the move into higher levels of the organization for approvals could that means that perhaps we see larger, more strategic deals as those deals close?\nYamini Rangan: Hey, Brad, thanks a lot for both of those questions. I'll start with a Service Hub one. We're very happy with the traction that we're beginning to see following the relaunch. And just as a general reminder, we launched a number of features in both Q1 as well as Q2, including SLAs, mobile, help desk, inbound calling, you name it, like there was a very long list of really needed moving features. And the focus for us that part is -- has been providing a modern helpdesk that provides omni channel support and great AI powered automation. And the question that we asked after a major relaunch of a project product like that is, are more customers buying the products? Are more customers using the products? And are more customers happy with the product? And all three are trending positively and in the right direction. And in the past quarter, we've seen customer usage of features like ticket and inbox to increase. And so overall, the feedback from Service Hub has been very positive. Our partners are beginning to see this as traction in terms of the conversations they're having. And so is our direct sales team. So I think that's one, the second part of your question, which is the more decision makers need more strategic deals; it certainly means more platform and multi hub deals. And that's exactly what they're seeing in conversations. As you get a CEO, or CFO getting involved in the field, the question they're asking is, what can be eliminated what can be consolidated and therefore, for us, it has been leaning into our platform message, as well as the value proposition which is we deliver a very cohesive, a connected, easy to use platform. Now in the prepared remarks, I gave you an example of Sando [ph] that was exactly the nature of the conversation. You're already on a couple of hubs from HubSpot. What does it mean to have HubSpot as the platform and how does it drive both direct revenue impact, as well as cost savings? And that's the nature of the conversations you're having.\nBrad Sills: That's great to hear. Thanks Yamini.\nOperator: We now turn to Ken Wong from Oppenheimer & Co. Your line is open.\nKen Wong: Great, thank you for taking my question. A couple of quick ones here. I just wanted to maybe dive into that one and a half point growth headwind due to macro. Think we saw some guys tossed out softness tossed out longer sales cycles in terms of some of the headwinds. Just wanted to double check to see are you seeing? Is it just purely sales cycles lengthening? Or are customers walking away trimming deal sizes as a reflection of the softness? What's the right way to think about that movement? And then the second piece just around moving back to spend? Is that more of a near term tactical response to macro or a broader shift in the growth and profitability algorithm?\nYamini Rangan: Hey, Ken, thanks a lot for the question. In terms of the way to think about this, it's really more conversations and elongation of the sales cycle. When you have additional executives get involved, we're spending the time on making sure that there is clarity and how our solution actually impacts revenue. And most of the time, like I said, in my prepared remarks, it actually comes back and we see it, and then in, in the first or next couple of weeks, those deals can close. And so I think the way to think about it is that elongation and more scrutiny in terms of the budget and more scrutiny in terms of the decision making, but it results in favorable closing for HubSpot, and we\u2019ll continue to execute in a way that it goes forward from there. I think the second question that you've had is, is there more near term practical response or more changed long term. From a HubSpot perspective, we will reflect what our customers need at this moment and certainly we'll have some changes in the near term in terms of how we're responding. But longer term, the secular trends for our customers remain really consistent. We are in the middle of going from a marketing automation company to a CRM platform. We are in the middle of not just serving the smaller end of SMBs, but really going up market. And both of those continue to remain strong. And they both provide durable, longer term growth levers for us. And we'll continue to have those kinds of conversations about customers.\nOperator: Our next question comes from\u2026.\nDharmesh Shah: I'm sorry. One quick thing to add on demand, as you know, we just had our product strategy meeting, which is, we spent eight hours talking about what customers are asking for, what partners are asking for. And one continuing trend we've seen is that customers still have ideas. It's not like they've kind of crawled into a hole like, okay, we're done here. They're still asking for new features. They're asking for new developments, so there's years and years of innovation left across the front office, which is not a static industry, where everyone's kind of said, okay, well, we're done here, we're seeing just as much kind of demand in terms of innovation from our customers and partners, as we have in the past, so that has not slowed down. And, and the list of things that we want to do over the coming years, is just as long as it's ever been.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Turrin from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nMichael Turrin: Hey, there, thanks. Appreciate you taking the question. Kate, I know it's not necessarily the best metric to focus in on for your model, but billings group 39% in constant currency on a tough compare, remind us the puts and takes of that metric. And it I mean, maybe it is seeing some impact. But why isn't that showing more impact given some of the later cycle characterizations we've heard across software companies. And then just any dynamics for us to be mindful of they're given some moving pieces in assumptions. And what you're seeing here currently is helpful. Thank you.\nKate Bueker: Yes, I mean, I guess what I would say is that, billing growth and constant currency and revenue growth and constant currency, generally speaking, are going to track one another. And you're seeing that in the results that we put up in Q2. The difference there is really just a point and a half, which is not particularly large. I think we would expect the relative trend over the back half of the year to kind of remain as it is.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Siti Panigrahi from Mizuho. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nSiti Panigrahi: Thanks for taking my question. Yamini, thanks for setting a playbook to how to navigate uncertainty. When you compare contrast last, 2020, post COVID versus now I mean wanting to say digital enabled versus digitally powered now? It doesn't. I know in 2020, you're more focused on acquiring more customers with that promotion. Could you double click on how what's your strategy going to be now? Is this slowdown, is it more returning and we saw downgrades, subscription downgrades, post pandemic? Could you double take double click how you're trying to be different in your strategy this time versus last what we saw in 2020?\nYamini Rangan: Yes, Siti thanks a lot for the question. I would say that going into the pandemic, the conversations with customers, and what the focus was, was just getting digitally enabled. And there was, I would say, almost buying three towards multiple points, solutions and getting digitally powered, right? Now, as I have conversations with our customers two things have shifted. First off, the conversation is much more about what is the level of revenue impact and what is the level of cost efficiency I can get that is, front and center in a lot of the conversation. So, from our playbook perspective, going into the pandemic, we literally turned around, had our sales organization, Customer Success organization, all focused on helping small and medium businesses get online. Now, our playbooks are turning around, and it's really focused on driving revenue impact, as well as a cost saving for our customers and ensuring that they get the most out of the spend that they've had over the last couple of years. And so when we talk about our playbook and solving for the customers, really everything centers around what is their current top priority? And how can we be very helpful in terms of helping them meet their challenges.\nOperator: We now turn to Terry Tillman from Truist Securities. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. Thanks for taking question. This is Robert Dion [ph] for Terry. Appreciate the International Carwash group case study on payments. But here's to get some feedback on what you've heard from customers using it and where customers are seeing other quantifiable impacts from embedding the feature into CRM? Thanks.\nYamini Rangan: Yes, that's a that's a great question, Robert. I mean, look, I think from a payments perspective, we've said, this is a strategic path, and we are patiently nurturing. And we think it's a very big growth opportunity for us going into the future. And it is actually worth we're trading that payments and commerce for us is based on two very solid hypothesis. The first one is that B2B businesses can grow revenue by selling more online. And it kind of seems very obvious with what we have seen in B2B, but B2B businesses are kind of slower in terms of doing that. And so that is, number one hypothesis. The second part of our hypothesis is that commerce context within CRM will help businesses grow. Why, because when you bring payments, objects and data into a marketing campaign, or in a sales conversation, or you have the support conversation, and it's grounded in terms of what the customer has paid, and what they have purchased from us, then it really helps them grow. So those are our two main hypothesis. And over the past year, our conviction in terms of those two hypothesis has only grown. And the feedback from the customers that we're working with is that, yes, we have now found new ways to sell online. This was the example that I gave in the prepared remarks and guess bringing payments dashboard and connecting it with CRM provides us more visibility into a customer not just before they become a customer, but after they become a customer and they continue to grow with us. And so, we'll certainly share more examples as we go in the future. But broadly speaking, both of those use cases and hypothesis are validated and we're continuing to focus on driving great customer experience. We found the fit now we have to drive great customer experience from the time that they discover payments within HubSpot to the time they close the transaction and continue to grow with us. So we're happy with what we're hearing from customers there.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kirk Materne from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nKirk Materne: Yes, thanks very much. Yamini, sorry if you touched upon this, but just to be clear on the deals that are getting elongated, is there any, I guess split towards you either expansion with existing customers or new customers? It sounds like it's just multi product deals that are bigger in nature from a spend perspective that are getting pushed, I wasn't sure if that was impacting perhaps expansion more or net new. If you can add any color there, that'd be helpful.\nYamini Rangan: Yes, Kirk, it's a good question. And look, I think in terms of what we are seeing both in elongation more people, it's kind of across both install base as well as new. Having said that, I think it's a shorter term, we'll see the mix between install base and new move around. First off, as I mentioned, a couple of times here, we're seeing consolidating, consolidation on fewer platforms. And so if they already have marketing club, or they already have failed pub, they're looking at HubSpot to further consolidate, and that drives more of an installed base mix. And the second part of it is that our product portfolio has expanded both in terms of breadth as well as in depth. And our install base has grown pretty significantly in the last couple of years. So our direct and partner teams have been, more into kind of our broader value proposition as well as install base. And so why we see this mix between install base and new move a little bit around month to month, we see a very healthy balance as we look into the future, both based on what our customers are telling us as well as our product innovation cycle there.\nOperator: Our final question comes from Taylor McGinnis from UBS. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nTaylor McGinnis: Yes, hi, thanks so much for squeezing my question and maybe going off on you know, Michael's question earlier. I believe, duration and co-terming has impacted billing from one quarter to the next. So any thoughts that you can provide on the impact that that might have had on a year-over-year basis. And I guess just given the strength of this metric, does that mean, the lower constant currency rep, rep guide is more reflective of what you're seeing in the pipeline today, as maybe, post to the quarter? And is there any conservatism, embedded in the guide that the slowdown could worsen? And maybe just wanting to be mindful of that? Thanks.\nYamini Rangan: Yes, there's not a ton that I would add around the billing side. We have been consistently seeing a little bit of a shortening of duration over the last couple of years. And that just continued into Q2. So I was not new news. They're just a continuation of the trends that we've been seeing. In terms of the guidance and I tried to cover this in Gabrielle's question. We assumed in the guidance that we were going to continue to see the softness in the macro environment that we saw through June and July, and that would sort of sustain through the back half of the year. We are not assuming that we're going to see another step change down in the overall environment, nor are we assuming that we're going to see a recovery here. It's really just like a status quo from what we saw over the last couple of months.\nOperator: This concludes our Q&A. I will now hand back to Yamini Rangan, CEO of HubSpot for final remarks.\nYamini Rangan: Well, I want to end by thanking all of our employees for their commitment to our mission as well as just incredible work. I also want to thank our customers, partners and investors for their support. And I look forward to seeing many of you at the analyst day at INBOUND in a couple of months. Thanks a lot everyone.\nOperator: Today\u2019s call is now concluded. We like to thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Kate Bueker",
            "content": "Thanks Yamini. Let's turn to our second quarter 2022 financial results. Second quarter revenue grew 41% year-over-year in constant currency and 36% on an as reported basis. Q2 subscription revenue grew 37% year-over-year, while services and other revenue decreased 10% on an as reported basis. Domestic revenue grew 35% year-over-year in Q2, while international revenue growth was 49% in constant currency, and 37% as reported. International revenue represented 46% of total revenue in Q2. We added approximately 7100 net new customers in the quarter, bringing our total customer count to over 150,000 up 25% year-over-year. Average subscription revenue per customer grew 14% year-over-year in constant currency and 10% on an as reported basis to $11,200. This was driven by continued strength and multi hub adoption. We saw healthy net revenue retention rates in Q2 on a continued strong foundation and customer retention and nice cross sell and upsell activity. Deferred revenue as of the end of June was $474 million or 31% increase year-over-year. Calculated billings were $433 million in Q2, growing 39% year-over-year in constant currency, and 30% as reported. The remainder of my comments will refer to non-GAAP measures. Second quarter gross margin was 82%, up one point year-over-year. Subscription gross margin was 85% in Q2 while services and other gross margin was negative 42%. Second quarter operating margin was 7%, down two point's year-over-year. There was approximately a one point headwind to operating profit margin from FX in the quarter. Net income in the second quarter was $22 million or $0.44 per fully diluted share. At the end of the second quarter, we had just over 7000 employees up 41% year-over-year. CapEx including capitalized software development cost was $90 million, or 4% of revenue in Q2, and free cash flow in the quarter was $22 million or 5% of revenue. Finally, our cash and marketable securities totaled $1.4 million at the end of June. As Yamini highlighted we saw a softening in demand in June, marked by lengthening deal cycles, and more decision makers and deals. In light of this increased macroeconomic pressure, we are taking several actions to drive a continued balance between growth and profitability. We had a strong first half of hiring and have a talented team in place to execute against our strategic goals, which gives us the opportunity to slow our hiring in the second half of the year. We will continue to maintain investments in product and engineering and grow revenue generating sales headcount in the second half, but we will moderate headcount growth in other areas of the business. In addition, we are taking steps to pullback T&E facilities and other discretionary expenses in the second half of 2022. Before I turn to our outlook, I want to highlight the impact of foreign currency translation on our as reported financial results. U.S. Dollar strengthened sharply throughout Q2 and into July, creating a meaningful incremental headwind to our 2022 as reported revenue and non-GAAP operating profit relative to the guidance we provided on our May earnings call. At current spot rates, we now expect FX to negatively impact full year 2022 revenue growth by six points up from our prior expectation of a five point headwind. Finally, our guidance assumes continued macroeconomic headwinds throughout the remainder of the year. And with that, let's review our guidance for the third quarter and full year of 2022. For the third quarter, total as reported revenue is expected to be in the range of $425 million to $426 million, up 25% year-over-year at the midpoint. We expect FX to be an eight point headwind as reported revenue growth in the third quarter. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be between $31 million and $32 million. Non-GAAP, diluted net income per share is expected to be between $0.50 and $0.52. This assumes 51.0 million fully diluted shares outstanding. And for the full year of 2022, total as reported revenue is now expected to be in the range of $1.69 billion to $1.695 billion, up 30% year-over-year at the midpoint. As I mentioned, we now expect FX to be a six point headwind to as reported revenue growth for the full year of 2022. Non-GAAP operating income is now expected to be between $143 million and $144 million, which includes an incremental $5 million FX headwind versus our prior forecast. Non-GAAP diluted net income per share is now expected to be between $2.28 and $2.30. This assumes 51.1 million fully diluted shares outstanding. As you adjust your models, keep in mind the following; we expect CapEx as a percentage of revenue to be roughly 5% and free cash flow to be about $200 million for the full year of 2022, including an incremental headwind of approximately $10 million from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to our prior forecast. And with that, I'll hand things back over to Yamini for her closing remarks. Yes, sure thing. As you know, we think about retention in two ways, we have a growth retention. That is the base of what we then ultimately have as net revenue retention, which happens after the net upsell. Net retention in our quarter was comfortably above that 110 target that we've been talking about, despite really the more difficult environment that we saw towards the end of the quarter. I think the good news there is that underneath that the growth retention remained really solid in the high 80s, which is the range that we've been talking about for a year or two now. And then on the net retention side, we had another quarter of really strong install base selling, which, in particular, edition upgrades and cross sell really led the way for us here in Q2. In the back half of the year, it's a good question. I would expect that net revenue retention will hang in there, I would call it around 110 for Q3, and Q4. Yes, sure. In terms of guidance, I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we're factoring in a continuation of the current weaker environment. That really means like we saw a weakness through June and July, and we're assuming that that continues through the rest of the year. So we're also assuming that foreign currency rates stay in and around current spot rates, which, as you know, is a one point incremental headwind to our growth for 2022. And we feel really good about our ability to deliver against that guidance. And the continued weaker environment we see today or even in something a little bit worse than that. Yes, maybe I'll dive in there. What we decided in May, Alex are the midpoint of our guide was 32.5% growth for full year revenue, and on an as reported basis. And our update is for 30% of the midpoint on an as reported basis, which is a 2.5% slowdown. One point of that is from FX. And then the other point and a half is associated with macro and business performance. I would like to remind you that our guidance includes six points of FX impact for the full year up from five. So our constant currency revenue growth has moved from 37.5% to 36% growth for 2022. And then, in terms of payment terms, we really haven't seen anything. Of note, I think the thing that we've seen most in sort of new deals is exactly what Yamini was talking about, which is a bit of a lengthening in the sales cycle, and more decision makers really getting involved before things are signed. Yes, maybe this is Kate; maybe I will dive on in around KPIs. I think you've heard us say, over a long period of time that we see a lot of opportunity, both in continuing to drive new customer acquisition, and also in our ability to sell more of HubSpot into our install base. And, I think that the KPIs we saw in Q2 really demonstrated that balance pretty nicely. We added, 7000 plus new customers, and we were able to grow double digit, both income to currency and on an as reported basis our ASRPC. That being said, I think, as you look forward, and we've talked a lot about the moderating macro environment, we'll probably see a little bit of a moderation, similar to what we're seeing in revenue across our KPIs. And so we don't really give guidance there. But we do think we would anticipate kind of back half of the year or something that looks like 6000 to 7000 new customers added in Q3 and Q4 and ASRPC growth that looks closer to the 10% and of the double digit in constant currency. Yes, sure. In terms of impact, I think it will take time for us to recognize the full impact of the incremental price on marketing hub enterprise as customers go through the renewal process. And as we add new customers, any impacts for 2022 is incorporated in the guidance we shared earlier. Yes, Michael, I'll start. You're right. The reduction of the free cash flow estimate for the full year incorporates two things. One is an incremental $10 million headwind from foreign exchange on cash flow, and the other is in the demand environment reflected in our revenue guidance. Yes, I mean, look, I think that all product announcements carry with it some positive impact and momentum, if not internally and externally, but it's not a huge needle mover for us, given the timeline. And it, as I said, it's all already there in the guidance. Yes, you're right. So Q2 stock comp expense every year is a high watermark for us as a percentage of revenue, because we do a catch up and expense for two quarters. And so that 19% in Q2 will be the high watermark for 2022. The increase is driven by a few things. One, there's an impact, we had a bunch of notable executive hires over the last six months, and that is that impact. And then the other big change is that we made a shift in our RFQ investing from four years to three years for all of our employees. We think it was an important change for us to make it increase the attractiveness of the RFQ and increase the retentive value of the RFQ. And so those are really the two big drivers of the SPC increase. That's even with those changes; we pay a lot of attention to stock comp as a percentage of revenue. We also pay a lot of attention to dilution. And we look at our management of those relative to our peer companies. And we still compare very well against the software companies in general. I think you got it. Yes, I mean, I guess what I would say is that, billing growth and constant currency and revenue growth and constant currency, generally speaking, are going to track one another. And you're seeing that in the results that we put up in Q2. The difference there is really just a point and a half, which is not particularly large. I think we would expect the relative trend over the back half of the year to kind of remain as it is."

            "name": "Yamini Rangan",
            "content": "Thank you Chuck, and welcome to everyone joining us on the call. Today, I want to focus on the Q2 results, what's driving performance and HubSpot's playbook for driving durable growth over the long-term. First, let's kick it off with our results this quarter. Q2 was a solid quarter for HubSpot with revenue growing 41% year-over-year in constant currency and total customers growing 25% year-over-year to more than 150,000 globally with more than 50% using multiple HubSpot products. These results were driven by strong product innovation, a deep understanding of what our customers need in order to grow today and focussed execution. As I talked to our customers, it is clear that SMBs need to do more with less as they navigate the current macroeconomic environment. They're looking for ways to consolidate their fragmented tech stack of point solutions, improve efficiencies, and get better visibility into their customers journey. As a result, HubSpot connected, easy to use platform is mission critical for our customers. Let's start with product innovation in the second quarter. We're focused on delivering a world class Front Office platform by investing in our anchor hubs of marketing, sales and service and by innovating with our newer hubs. We made important strides in both areas in Q2. Last time we talked, I shared the exciting news, that marketing hub had just surpassed a billion dollars in annual recurring revenue. In Q2, we unlocked marketing automation features in the start up here, so that marketers can deliver a personalized touch without draining personal time. Teams can now engage and convert customers faster by personalizing and segmenting marketing efforts and automating routine tasks. This unlocks tremendous value for the start up here. On the upper end of the market, we're increasing marketing hub enterprise pricing in September, to match the additional value we've been delivering to customers over the last few years with more sophisticated functionality, like revenue attribution reporting, AI powered AB testing, and more. These changes are consistent with our pricing and packaging strategy of driving high value features down to starter, while fueling innovation at the higher tiers. During our last call, we had also just re-launched service hub, and over the past quarter, we've been pleased to see customer usage of features like tickets, and inbox tools increase. In Q2, we further enhance service hub by launching inbound calling, so that customers can provide real time service and engagement over the phone. With these developments, we're making meaningful progress with service hub to empower our customers to deliver an exceptional customer experience at scale. Another big product milestone in Q2 was the launch of CMS Hub Free. Why Free CMS now? Well, every business today starts with a website to connect with their customers. But too often, they're forced to choose between free content management systems with limited customization or robust solutions that are cost prohibitive, especially in this environment. What differentiates CMS Hub from other website building tools is that it's powered by a Free CRM platform. That means companies can easily build a beautiful website to attract visitors and leverage CRM to nurture that business across their entire front office, all on HubSpot. That combination is powerful and unique. As part of the launch in June, we also introduced CMS website themes in our marketplace to give Business Builders the tools and the assets to get started online. As a result, we've seen nearly 4000 CMS free signups in the first month since launch, and 110% increase in marketplace transactions. I'm really excited that these results and the large green space opportunity to drive premium growth with CMS Free. This pace of product innovation in the second quarter demonstrates that HubSpot is making meaningful progress to become the platform of choice for scaling businesses. Okay, shifting gears, I want to acknowledge that we like a number of companies saw lengthening of deal cycles, and more decision makers getting involved in deals in June. While we cannot predict how the macroeconomic environment will evolve in the second half, I want to share the HubSpot playbook for how we will navigate through the uncertainty in the short term while driving the business towards strong durable growth over the long term. Then in a few minutes, Kate will talk about how we're planning to continue to grow profitability in the software demand environment. One of HubSpot's trends is that we focus on near term execution while driving a clear long term strategy. During times of uncertainty in the past, we've continued to play strategic bets that will help us and our customers emerge stronger. We did this successfully throughout the pandemic by following three core principles; solving for a customer, sustained investments in product and execute with focus. We're taking the same approach to drive durable growth now. Let me unpack each of these core principles. During the pandemic, solving for the customer was all about helping businesses become digitally enabled. Now, it is about helping customers become digitally powered, by helping them consolidate on a single platform to drive efficiencies. For example, take Sando [ph] design, a digital design branding agency. Before HubSpot their front office consisted of multiple point solutions that are cobbled together by different departments. Our team helped them consolidate all of their point's solutions and moved their entire front office onto the HubSpot platform. Before implementing HubSpot, it took them months to create landing pages and email campaigns. Now it just takes a few days. Additionally, Sando design has saved thousands of dollars by getting rid of point solutions. This is exactly how our customers are reducing costs, increasing efficiency and growing better by consolidating on HubSpot. The second principle in our playbook is to sustain investments in product. Throughout the pandemic, we maintain our investment in product innovation. This enabled us to create levers for long term growth with platform and payments. And now we're continuing to build on that foundation. In the second quarter, we enhanced our platform for our customers with more sophisticated means by releasing new sales hub features that enable CRM customization and crafted data management. We also continue to expand HubSpot app ecosystem, with our integration catalog growing nearly 40% year-over-year. Moving forward, we will continue to invest in our developer's strategy to drive customization and extensibility of the HubSpot platform. We also made meaningful progress in payments by launching new features including paid meetings, forms and links. In addition to recurring ACH and payments object. These features are helping our customers unlock the power of a commerce enabled CRM. Take the non-profit trade group, international carwash association as an example. They're disconnected payment and fulfillment paths were creating customer friction and lots of manual processing. They were already using HubSpot marketing, sales and service hub when they decided to implement payments to connect the buyer's journey. Since adopting payments, they've increased e-commerce sales by 400% and set up the fulfillment process by nearly twofold. This is a powerful example of how B2B businesses can sell online and create new revenue streams with HubSpot. Looking ahead, we plan to sustain key investments in products so that we can emerge stronger as a platform of choice. The third and final principle is to execute with focus. Like every business, there are many factors outside of our control due to uncertainty in the macro environment. So we will control the controllables. We're focused on driving both direct and partner enablement, reaching our customers with relevant TCO playbooks and continuing to build a foundation for excellent execution. These principles have helped guide HubSpot to the position of strength we are in today. The long term drivers of our business remained solid, as HubSpot continues to be mission critical for our customers. And we are making meaningful progress towards becoming the number one CRM platform for scaling companies. With that, I'll hand it over to Kate to talk about our financial results and our strategy for driving profitable growth. Thank you so much, Kate. I want to close by saying we are confident in HubSpot's future despite the headwinds we are seeing from the macro environment. We have a clear strategy to drive long term durable and profitable growth and award winning culture and an incredible team solving for our customers every single day. I want to thank our employees globally for their adaptability and commitment to our mission. Lastly, I look forward to seeing many of you at our analysts day as part of our INBOUND 2022 event on September 7. With that operator, please open up the call for questions. Yes, thanks a lot Samad for that question. We are seeing two trends. First of all, these cycles are lengthening and more decision makers, specifically CFOs and CEOs are getting pulled into deals for approval. Now, in early May, we were one of the first companies to transparently share that we saw deals taking longer in Europe. And in June, we saw these trends become more broad based across our segments and the GEOs [ph] that we serve. Now, while these trends will have impact in the short term, and it is reflected within our guidance, we are confident in HubSpot's long term growth opportunity for a couple of reasons. First off, why these deals are taking longer? They are coming down to platform and multi hub decisions. SMBs are figuring out how to spend effectively, and they're looking at HubSpot as the platform to run their front office. So we see deals close favorably, but taking a little bit longer. And second, we're not a discretionary point solutions. We're the backbone for small and medium businesses. All these businesses still need to market, they need to sell, they need to serve as their customers. And HubSpot is a system of record and engagement for customer data. So we're mission critical, and they're sticky. So while we're seeing the demand trend softened a bit in the short term, we are very confident in our strategy and long term growth. Thanks for that question, Samad. Yes, thanks a lot, Arjun for the question. So look, I think the best way to think about is the more discreet changes are deal cycles, elongating and more decision makers kind of getting involved as they assess their budget as they do a double click and scrutinize their investments. And this is not just happening in one part, it's kind of happening across geo segments and industries and I there's not anything more specific, the BC in terms of pipeline, assets close to through from the top of the funnel all the way down. Now, having said that, as I talked to customers hear from customers around the quarter, there are a couple of feeds, right. Customers are looking for clear revenue impact, so the closer the solution is to driving the impact, the faster the customer decision. So from our perspective, we are leading with a clear impact from having marketing sales service tied together. The other part that's changing is that customers want to be able to do more with less, that means they are okay giving up on point solutions. They're looking for more platform level solutions that are very cost effective. So we're leading with our CRM platform as well as multi help value proposition to have very clear TCO savings decision for our customers. And so that's how I would think about the color. Yes, thanks a lot, Gabriela. I'll start with the first one, which is, there any color specifically around products or segments? If not, I will say broadly, as we look at how customers are focused on [Indiscernible] they are deprioritizing -- that is not closely tied to revenue, examples of that could be like events, and brands and adds them, those are areas that they're deprioritizing. And they're prioritizing, then that clearly drive pipelines, and it's closer to revenue. And examples of that are, sales marketing that continues to help them grow. And so, I think it's really a question of where they are prioritizing. I think more broadly speaking, there is look at, how many points solutions do we have? Do we need all of these? And is there an opportunity to eliminate some of these points solutions and consolidate on a platform like HubSpot? And that's certainly a value proposition that we're leaning into, for both monitoring hub sales, as well as our entire suite sales. I'll pass it to Kate for the second half. We can. Sure, Keith, I'll take the first part of the question, and then I'll have Kate comment on the second part, which is impact. Well from a pricing perspective, we will stay very consistent with our pricing and packaging philosophy that we have talked to you all about. We pour innovation and build powerful features within the Enterprise tier and over time we will bring those high end features down to professional starter and premium editions. That's been our pricing and packaging philosophy for a while. When we have added tremendous value, then we look at pricing changes. And that's been very consistent. So what I mentioned in the prepared remarks today is that with marketing com, we've innovated, we've added tons of incremental value over the last few years. And the last time we increased price for marketing hub enterprise was inbound 2018. So that was like four years ago. And they're certainly added a lot of value. So what we did in July is that we announced an upcoming modest increase in terms of pricing that will be effective, nine one for new customers, it's kind of in that 12% range. And that announcement has gone out, we are tracking the feedback from customers, and it has been fine so far. So broadly, we'll continue to stay focused on driving a lot of value with our products. And when we deliver value to customers, we look at pricing and packaging decisions and changes. Kate, I will pass it to you. Yes. And, and so Michael, I'll pick the second part of the question in terms of how we see the demand for front office evolve. Look, I mean, coming straight out of the pandemic, it was just massive tailwind. Every small medium business that needed to get connected to their customers needed some kind of digital marketing or sales or support. And so I'd say that was just acceleration for adopting new solutions. And I think now it is much more about driving productivity and making sure that it is very close to revenue impact, and it's also very, very cost effective. So I think the nature of the conversations and therefore the nature of the demand has shifted, but broadly, our SMB customers, they are continuing on their path to digital transformation, the conversations and certainly the rigor with which they look at a purchase decision has changed. Yes, I'll start with that. I mean, look, I think in terms of the price increase in the feedback, as I mentioned marketing club enterprise has gone through a very, very fast pace of innovation. We've added a tremendous number of features there. I mentioned revenue attribution reporting, but that's just the first of many we've done a lot in terms of omni channel marketing and building a world class marketing solution. So innovations have gone in there, which means our customers understand they use it and they are leveraging it. And we have not increased prices for the last four years. So the feedback from our customers that's going to [Indiscernible] then got it, we get it given the level of innovation. And we'll keep tracking, the feedback from our partners as well as customers. And Kate, I don't know if you want to add more in terms of how we think about flowing this. Yes, so Elizabeth thanks a lot for the question. In terms of what we are seeing, it's very, very consistent with what I said earlier, there. We saw broad base shifts in terms of the time it takes, but really not that much more. Now, in terms of our go-to-market strategy, think that was an earlier question and how we are adapting, though the place to start, if all this what are the customer conversations focused on. And the customer conversations are focused clearly on revenue impact, or TCO cost savings. That's how the nature has changed and which means, from go-to-market strategy perspective, we're focused on both campaigns as well as arming our direct sales team, the partner organization and our customer success organization with those very specific value messages. Now more broadly, time of shift like this is doubling down on direct and partner enablement, doubling down on the right kinds of messages where we can deliver value to our customers, and overall additional rigor within the sales process and sales execution. That's how I would kind of look at it. I don't know if Kate you have anything else to add? Hey, Brad, thanks a lot for both of those questions. I'll start with a Service Hub one. We're very happy with the traction that we're beginning to see following the relaunch. And just as a general reminder, we launched a number of features in both Q1 as well as Q2, including SLAs, mobile, help desk, inbound calling, you name it, like there was a very long list of really needed moving features. And the focus for us that part is -- has been providing a modern helpdesk that provides omni channel support and great AI powered automation. And the question that we asked after a major relaunch of a project product like that is, are more customers buying the products? Are more customers using the products? And are more customers happy with the product? And all three are trending positively and in the right direction. And in the past quarter, we've seen customer usage of features like ticket and inbox to increase. And so overall, the feedback from Service Hub has been very positive. Our partners are beginning to see this as traction in terms of the conversations they're having. And so is our direct sales team. So I think that's one, the second part of your question, which is the more decision makers need more strategic deals; it certainly means more platform and multi hub deals. And that's exactly what they're seeing in conversations. As you get a CEO, or CFO getting involved in the field, the question they're asking is, what can be eliminated what can be consolidated and therefore, for us, it has been leaning into our platform message, as well as the value proposition which is we deliver a very cohesive, a connected, easy to use platform. Now in the prepared remarks, I gave you an example of Sando [ph] that was exactly the nature of the conversation. You're already on a couple of hubs from HubSpot. What does it mean to have HubSpot as the platform and how does it drive both direct revenue impact, as well as cost savings? And that's the nature of the conversations you're having. Hey, Ken, thanks a lot for the question. In terms of the way to think about this, it's really more conversations and elongation of the sales cycle. When you have additional executives get involved, we're spending the time on making sure that there is clarity and how our solution actually impacts revenue. And most of the time, like I said, in my prepared remarks, it actually comes back and we see it, and then in, in the first or next couple of weeks, those deals can close. And so I think the way to think about it is that elongation and more scrutiny in terms of the budget and more scrutiny in terms of the decision making, but it results in favorable closing for HubSpot, and we'll continue to execute in a way that it goes forward from there. I think the second question that you've had is, is there more near term practical response or more changed long term. From a HubSpot perspective, we will reflect what our customers need at this moment and certainly we'll have some changes in the near term in terms of how we're responding. But longer term, the secular trends for our customers remain really consistent. We are in the middle of going from a marketing automation company to a CRM platform. We are in the middle of not just serving the smaller end of SMBs, but really going up market. And both of those continue to remain strong. And they both provide durable, longer term growth levers for us. And we'll continue to have those kinds of conversations about customers. Yes, Siti thanks a lot for the question. I would say that going into the pandemic, the conversations with customers, and what the focus was, was just getting digitally enabled. And there was, I would say, almost buying three towards multiple points, solutions and getting digitally powered, right? Now, as I have conversations with our customers two things have shifted. First off, the conversation is much more about what is the level of revenue impact and what is the level of cost efficiency I can get that is, front and center in a lot of the conversation. So, from our playbook perspective, going into the pandemic, we literally turned around, had our sales organization, Customer Success organization, all focused on helping small and medium businesses get online. Now, our playbooks are turning around, and it's really focused on driving revenue impact, as well as a cost saving for our customers and ensuring that they get the most out of the spend that they've had over the last couple of years. And so when we talk about our playbook and solving for the customers, really everything centers around what is their current top priority? And how can we be very helpful in terms of helping them meet their challenges. Yes, that's a that's a great question, Robert. I mean, look, I think from a payments perspective, we've said, this is a strategic path, and we are patiently nurturing. And we think it's a very big growth opportunity for us going into the future. And it is actually worth we're trading that payments and commerce for us is based on two very solid hypothesis. The first one is that B2B businesses can grow revenue by selling more online. And it kind of seems very obvious with what we have seen in B2B, but B2B businesses are kind of slower in terms of doing that. And so that is, number one hypothesis. The second part of our hypothesis is that commerce context within CRM will help businesses grow. Why, because when you bring payments, objects and data into a marketing campaign, or in a sales conversation, or you have the support conversation, and it's grounded in terms of what the customer has paid, and what they have purchased from us, then it really helps them grow. So those are our two main hypothesis. And over the past year, our conviction in terms of those two hypothesis has only grown. And the feedback from the customers that we're working with is that, yes, we have now found new ways to sell online. This was the example that I gave in the prepared remarks and guess bringing payments dashboard and connecting it with CRM provides us more visibility into a customer not just before they become a customer, but after they become a customer and they continue to grow with us. And so, we'll certainly share more examples as we go in the future. But broadly speaking, both of those use cases and hypothesis are validated and we're continuing to focus on driving great customer experience. We found the fit now we have to drive great customer experience from the time that they discover payments within HubSpot to the time they close the transaction and continue to grow with us. So we're happy with what we're hearing from customers there. Yes, Kirk, it's a good question. And look, I think in terms of what we are seeing both in elongation more people, it's kind of across both install base as well as new. Having said that, I think it's a shorter term, we'll see the mix between install base and new move around. First off, as I mentioned, a couple of times here, we're seeing consolidating, consolidation on fewer platforms. And so if they already have marketing club, or they already have failed pub, they're looking at HubSpot to further consolidate, and that drives more of an installed base mix. And the second part of it is that our product portfolio has expanded both in terms of breadth as well as in depth. And our install base has grown pretty significantly in the last couple of years. So our direct and partner teams have been, more into kind of our broader value proposition as well as install base. And so why we see this mix between install base and new move a little bit around month to month, we see a very healthy balance as we look into the future, both based on what our customers are telling us as well as our product innovation cycle there. Yes, there's not a ton that I would add around the billing side. We have been consistently seeing a little bit of a shortening of duration over the last couple of years. And that just continued into Q2. So I was not new news. They're just a continuation of the trends that we've been seeing. In terms of the guidance and I tried to cover this in Gabrielle's question. We assumed in the guidance that we were going to continue to see the softness in the macro environment that we saw through June and July, and that would sort of sustain through the back half of the year. We are not assuming that we're going to see another step change down in the overall environment, nor are we assuming that we're going to see a recovery here. It's really just like a status quo from what we saw over the last couple of months. Well, I want to end by thanking all of our employees for their commitment to our mission as well as just incredible work. I also want to thank our customers, partners and investors for their support. And I look forward to seeing many of you at the analyst day at INBOUND in a couple of months. Thanks a lot everyone."

Now it's my pleasure to turn over the call to HubSpot's Chief Executive Officer, Yamini Rangan. Yamini?\nYamini Rangan: Thank you, Chuck, and welcome everyone. Thank you for joining us today as we review HubSpot's first quarter 2022 results. To start off, I first want to acknowledge the devastating situation in Ukraine. We're deeply saddened by the Russian invasion and our hearts go out to the people of Ukraine. With this war and ongoing pandemic in volatile markets, it's clear that we continue to live in a time of great uncertainty. 2022 is a year of focus and consistency at HubSpot for that exact reason. With that backdrop, now let's talk through HubSpot's first quarter results. HubSpot saw strong performance across the business with revenue growing 44% in constant currency year-over-year in the first quarter and total customers growing 26% year-over-year to more than 143,000 customers globally. These results prove that HubSpot continues to be mission critical for our customers. The pandemic accelerated digital transformation and fundamentally transformed the way companies could buy and sell. Our customers are faced with hybrid work, decentralized teams and disconnected systems, creating a significant growth challenge. As a result, they're realizing it's even more important to have a single unified view of the customer in order to grow. That's why our customers continue to choose HubSpot. We provide a connected easy to use platform that enables growth. In 2022, we're continuing to focus on helping our customers grow and executing on our clear growth strategy. We've previously shared the four strategic priorities guiding our paths to becoming the number one CRM platform for scaling companies. Now, I want to walk you through the meaningful progress we made over the past quarter in each of those areas. Our first strategic priority is to deliver a world-class front office platform by investing in our anchor hubs and innovating with new emerging hubs. We recently crossed two important milestones on this front. First off, I'm thrilled to report that Marketing Hub surpassed $1 billion in annual recurring revenue in the first quarter. We've built a world-class marketing automation platform that's powerful and easy to use. And over the past couple of years, we've made significant investments to better serve all of our customer segments. We've enhanced the onboarding and user experience and introduced simple automation functionality to free and starter tiers. To serve the higher end of the market, we rolled out business units and advanced reporting capabilities that drive deeper insights. These investments have enabled Marketing Hub to achieve significant scale of $1 billion in ARR and now we have the opportunity to replicate the success across all of our anchor hubs. HubSpot operates in markets with very large TAMs. And when we build world-class products that solve for our customers like Marketing Hub, we see scale. I'm incredibly excited about this milestone and the opportunity ahead for HubSpot. The second milestone is that we recently relaunched Service Hub with expanded features and functionality. In today's hybrid world, customers expect a service experience that's human and exceptional. We build service up to enable small medium businesses to deliver that kind of exceptional service. Our Service Hub strategy is threefold: build a modern support center, deliver omnichannel support and drive AI powered automation and insights. As part of the relaunch in March, we introduced service level agreements, a mobile helpdesk and support workspace to fuel a modern support center. To power omnichannel support, we added customer portals, live chat, Facebook messenger and email functionality. And to provide our customers with richer automation and insights, we added feedback surveys and ticket automation. I'm also pleased to share that inbound calling is now generally available to service and Sales Hub customers as of this week. We believe this will empower our customers to provide an even more authentic service in real-time. I'm excited by the early feedback we are hearing from our customers about the new features and the value that they're seeing from Service Hub. One that customer is Dake, a trusted name in metalworking manufacturing since 1887. Their legacy customer service system was holding them back from providing a level of service that matched the quality of their products. So Dake started with Marketing Hub and Sales Hub, they saw a ton of value from HubSpot and expanded to Service Hub as a result. Dake now use this shared inboxes to gain visibility into customer interactions throughout the journey and leverages automation to streamline all of the manual tasks all of which increases their productivity. With Service Hub, Dake has improved their customer satisfaction score by 13 points up to 87%. This illustrates how a connected platform makes it possible to remove friction and deliver an incredible customer experience. Now, let's talk about our second strategic priority, which is to strengthen our segmentation approach across both product and go-to-market. Our approach here is twofold. We want to drive volume at the lower end of the market with products that are easy to buy and easy to use and we want to fuel value on the higher end with robust features for customers with sophisticated needs. In Q1, we made a few key investments here. On the lower end, we introduced simple automation for free and started tiers as I mentioned earlier. In addition to that, we are running experiments like pricing page optimization and self guided demos. These investments are resulting in strong adoption of our Starter suite. Within our upmarket segment, both our direct sales team and partner channel are focused on driving multi-hub sales and the investments we are making are beginning to pay off. We\u2019re seeing multi-hub adoption grow with 24% of our professional and enterprise customers now using three or more hubs. Looking ahead, we\u2019ll continue to focus on making HubSpot, an easy choice for scaling businesses and driving multi-hub adoption upmarket. Our third strategic priority is to invest in payments and commerce. As more businesses become digital first, having a native payment solution is critical for SMBs to grow. On our last call, I shared that HubSpot payments had just become generally available in the U.S. for B2B customers. I\u2019m pleased to share that we\u2019ve already expanded the offering with the addition of recurring ACH functionality and payments dashboard and objects, which are currently in beta. Payments object is a top requested feature because it really enables customers to see commerce data in all of their CRM interactions, delivering an even more unified view of their customers\u2019 journey. We\u2019re continuing to hear positive feedback from customers confirming the opportunity we see to empower businesses with a commerce enabled CRM. That said, we\u2019re early in our payments journey and our focus remains on building the features and functionality our customers need to help them grow. Moving on our fourth and final strategic priority is to build a sustainable company. An important part of that journey is hiring and developing diverse talent. In the last quarter, we released our annual diversity report and I want to celebrate how far we\u2019ve come as a company. Today, 47% of HubSpot employees globally identify as women or non-binary, up seven points over the past five years. In the U.S. 35% of employees identify as BIPOC, up 20 points from 2017. Additionally, we have four women on our executive leadership team, particularly proud of that. And 70% of our Board identifies as a woman or person of color. I\u2019m incredibly proud of how far we\u2019ve come and we\u2019ll continue to work towards building a company that reflects the diversity of our customers. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Kate to give an overview of our financial results for the quarter. Kate, take it away.\nKate Bueker: Thanks, Yamini. Let\u2019s turn to our first quarter 2022 financial results. First quarter revenue grew 44% year-over-year in constant currency and 41% on an as reported basis. Q1 subscription revenue grew 42% year-over-year, while services and other revenue decreased 4% on an as reported basis. Domestic revenue grew 37% year-over-year in Q1, while international revenue growth was 53% in constant currency and 44% as reported. International revenue as a percentage of total revenue increased by one point year-over-year to 46% in Q1. We added 8,200 net new customers in the quarter bringing our total customer count to over 143,000, up 26% year-over-year. Average subscription revenue per customer grew 12% year-over-year to just over $11,000, driven primarily by continued multi-hub adoption and strength in our enterprise tier. Deferred revenue as of the end of March was $463 million, a 36% increase year-over-year. Calculated billings were $423 million in Q1, growing 41% year-over-year in constant currency and 39% as reported. Consistent with trends we\u2019ve seen in prior quarters, constant currency revenue growth exceeded constant currency billings growth in Q1, primarily as a result of the strong install base selling mix in the quarter and a lower overall billing duration. The remainder of my comments will refer to non-GAAP measures. First quarter gross margin was 82%, up one point year-over-year. Subscription gross margin was 85% in Q1, while services and other gross margin was negative 19%. First quarter operating margin was 9%, up two points compared to last year. Net income in the first quarter was $28 million or $0.54 per fully diluted share. At the end of the first quarter, we had 6,400 employees, up 41% year-over-year. CapEx, including capitalized software development cost was $20 million or 5% of revenue in Q1 and free cash flow in the quarter was $63 million or 16% of revenue. Finally, our cash and marketable securities totaled $1.4 billion at the end of March. Before I turn to our outlook, I wanted to highlight the impact of foreign currency translation on our as reported financial results. The U.S. dollar strengthened sharply throughout Q1 and into May. This has created a meaningful, incremental headwind to our 2022 as reported revenue and non-GAAP operating profit relative to the guidance we provided on our February earnings call. At current spot rates, we now expect FX to negatively impact full year revenue growth by five points up from our prior expectations of a three-point headwind and to create a headwind to non-GAAP operating profit margin of approximately a half a percentage point. And with that, let\u2019s dive into guidance for the second quarter and full year of 2022. For the second quarter, total as reported revenue is expected to be in the range of $409 to $410 million, up 32% year-over-year at the midpoint. We expect FX to be a six point headwind to as reported revenue growth in the second quarter. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be between $27 million and $28 million. Non-GAAP diluted net income per share is expected to be between $0.42 and $0.44. This assumes 51.2 million fully diluted shares outstanding. And for the full year of 2022, total as reported revenue is now expected to be in the range of $1.722 billion to $1.728 billion, up 33% year-over-year at the mid point. As I mentioned, we now expect FX to be a five-point headwind to as reported revenue growth for the full year of 2022, representing an incremental 30 million headwind to 2022 as reported revenue from our prior forecast. Non-GAAP operating income is now expected to be between $152 million and $154 million. This includes approximately $10 million or a half percent margin impact from the incremental FX headwind. Non-GAAP diluted net income per share is now expected to be between $2.40 and $2.42. This assumes 51.5 million fully diluted shares outstanding. As you adjust your models, keep in mind the following. We continue to expect CapEx as a percentage of revenue to be roughly 6% and now anticipate free cash flow to be about 230 million for the full year of 2022, including a headwind of about $10 million from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to our prior estimate. And with that, I\u2019ll hand things back over to Yamini for her closing remarks.\nYamini Rangan: Thank you so much, Kate. I want to close out by sharing two exciting developments on HubSpot\u2019s leadership team and Board. First, we recently welcome Rob Giglio as HubSpot\u2019s new Chief Customer Officer. Rob is a customer centric multidisciplinary leader who has seen tremendous scale from his time at Adobe and DocuSign. His expertise across marketing, sales and operations will meaningfully help a HubSpot scale, our go-to-market strategy through this next phase of growth. We're also thrilled that Claire Hughes Johnson, former COO of Stripe, joined our board this past quarter. We have so much to learn from her expertise scaling businesses, especially in the payment space. I'm confident we have the right team to execute on our vision of helping millions of organizations grow. And I'm really excited about the impact both Rob and Claire will have on our business. Looking ahead, our plan is to stay focused and execute on our four strategic priorities in 2022 to continue driving value for our customers, partners, employees and shareholders. With that operator please open up the call for some questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question today comes from Mark Murphy from J.P. Morgan. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nMark Murphy: Yes. Thank you very much. So Kate and Yamini, I wanted to ask you you're clearly absorbing just a tremendous amount of FX impact. We can see that you're actually raising guidance in constant currency. But I think one of the questions is what is your sense of the overall health of inputs just in terms of business confidence and pipeline built, for instance, is there any hesitancy in Europe or interest rate pressures for your SMB customers? Or do you think that that picture is actually fairly steady?\nYamini Rangan: Hi, Mark. Thanks lot for your question. Look like everyone else we are paying attention to all of the macro trends. We're watching interest rates. We're watching inflation. We're watching in demand trends more broadly. In terms of the impact, Mark, we saw some pockets of delays in purchasing decisions among customers, mostly in Europe. Now having said that and while the macroeconomic environment could change, it has not been a material headwind to the growth of our business. And more fundamentally, we're seeing a big secular change where customers are investing in front-office software to drive productivity and growth. And as you know, our customers leaned into technology during the pandemic to stay very, very connected to their end customers. And what I'm seeing now is that they're continuing to lean into technology as they operate in this hybrid world and drive productivity. And I think more specifically, we made a CRM bet a few years ago and that bet is working. Our product innovation is in high gear as you just heard me talk about the innovation that we \u2013 with the features we launched and relaunched this quarter, we're seeing customers consolidates on HubSpot because we are quick to implement, we're easy to use and we are easy to adopt and our value proposition is resonating within our customer base.\nMark Murphy: Thank you. And so, Yamini, just to clarify that anywhere there was a little pocket of purchasing delays in Europe. Are you signaling \u2013 are you saying that that was kind of counteracted elsewhere in the world because the customer ads are \u2013 were a bigger number than we've seen in a while. And I think I am just sort of wondering how are the customer ads possible given there was kind of a more volatile environment and just slower new business formation?\nKate Bueker: Maybe Mark I'll jump in and talk specifically to the customer as we were obviously happy to see the net new customer edition sort of pop back up above 8,000 for the quarter. The growth we're seeing quarter-over-quarter is really being driven at that starter tier. And we are \u2013 we saw within the quarter a positive uptick and gross additions at the starter level.\nMark Murphy: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Gabriela Borges from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nGabriela Borges: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. For Yamini, maybe I'll follow up on the comments on Service Hub. Since the re-release and the upgrade, curious what the feedback has been and if you're starting to see the pipeline change or your conversion rate or win rate go up based on some of the broader set of features and functionality.\nYamini Rangan: Hey, Gabriela, thanks for that question. I'm very excited about the Service Hub relaunch and the long list of new features that we launched. I think it's going to be a game changing for Service Hub, but more importantly it's just going to be game changing for the entire CRM platform because the combination of marketing sales and Service Hub becomes even more powerful. So I'd say that, our focus when we relaunched a Service Hub is just simple. We want our SMBs to be able to deliver just exceptional service. And what you saw deliver this quarter is a three pronged product strategy, which is to build a modern support center, deliver just omnichannel support and provide AI powered automation and insights like ticket predictions and smart routing and conversation intelligence. So, overall, we launched a ton of features that are going to be pretty big needle movers for SMBs. The reaction has been very, very positive. We see it in both kind of demand trends for Service Hub as well as feature usage. In fact, our ticketing usage has gone up since the relaunch and that shows that customers are getting a lot of value from the features that we released. And if I step back, I see three big opportunities that begin to accelerate with this relaunch. First, I think, we accelerate all of this cross-sell opportunity within the install base. So I can see Marketing Hub customers, Sales Hub customers, who've seen value from our platform, lean into Service Hub. Second, as I've mentioned, multi-hub adoption is a pretty big lever for us and Service Hub relaunch should bolster our ability to sell three plus hub deals. And then longer term, this is an important milestone for Service Hub to become alleged mid front door. So overall, very excited about this relaunch, but also hearing very good feedback from our partner community as well as our customers.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Samad Samana from Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nSamad Samana: Hi, good afternoon and congrats on the strong results. Maybe first one for you Yamini, it's great to hear that marketing hub crossed the billion dollar mark for ARR. It's not one of the largest yet still fastest growing marketing businesses in software. Can this be a durable growth driver going forward? And what investments need to be made to get there?\nYamini Rangan: Hi, Samad, yes, thanks a lot for the question. We're pretty excited about that important milestone. First off I'd say like marketing operates in a mega market. This is a market with a very large TAM and still low single-digit penetration. So I feel like there is plenty of opportunity and runway for us to grow and we see significant growth with Marketing Hub, but there is also a runway for us to build a multi-billion dollar business here. And as I talk to customers, it is clear that marketing needs have not remained static. And therefore marketing innovation is not remaining static. Almost every company is now looking for ways to drive more effectiveness in marketing, looking to support more channels. It's becoming much more omnichannel and marketing, more campaign visibility and more cohesion for the rest of the go-to-market, including sales and service. And so, we're not sitting still. On the product front, our focus is to drive that type of omnichannel marketing, which our customers need drive more advanced automation and a lot more reporting. We're doing all of this while maintaining that ease of use. And in fact, this is something that I was very excited about. Marketing Hub recently earned the number one spot in the TrustRadius 10 most Loved Products in 2022. That's just a great testament to the powerful and yet easy to use platforms that we're building in marketing. And then on the go-to-market side, Samad, Marketing Hub is in almost every marketing automation conversation within our segment. It's become a great front door, but more importantly it's becoming a de-facto standard within the customer segments that we're focused on. So we definitely feel very positive and there is plenty of runway left for marketing to grow. There is also a great playbook for the other anchor hubs to follow. So, happy about the results.\nSamad Samana: Great. And Kate, maybe a follow up for you. It's really impressive to see the increase in the constant currency guide. And I'm curious maybe how did net retention to that end trend in 1Q and maybe what you've seen early so far through May for net retention?\nKate Bueker: Yes, it's an interesting question Samad [Audio Dip] has over time become kind of a natural shape to the retention curve within a quarter where you tend to have more of the install base up for renewal in the third month. And so, what happens there is you have a bit of a lower gross retention in the third month and a bit of more upsell opportunity, so a bit of a higher net revenue retention as you finish the quarter and that is very much what we saw in Q1.\nSamad Samana: Great, appreciate the additional color. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brad Sills from Bank of America. Your line is open.\nBrad Sills: Oh, great. Thanks so much guys for taking my question and congratulations on a real nice quarter here. I wanted to ask about the upmarket business. We keep hearing about real strength there. It's obviously in the results. You could see the accelerating ASP growth constant currency now for several quarters in a row, so tremendous traction there. I wanted to ask what is the environment like up there, what is the landscape look like? Are these \u2013 what \u2013 is there an underserved segment here, a lot of white space, our customers running a hodgepodge of different tools. Maybe just a little bit of color on what's driving the success of there and where are customers coming from?\nYamini Rangan: Brad, thanks a lot for that question. And I think you're hitting on the right area. So if you peel back the onion and look at upmarket, there is a huge challenge for mid-market companies to stitch together, very disparate systems that don't work well. They don't have the time, they don't have the budget, they don't have the technical team sitting around and that's a fundamental challenge. They also have a challenge of being able to get clear visibility across their entire journey from marketing, from sales, from service, and they need that to be able to grow in any environment. And so I think, fundamentally, what is happening is that HubSpot is solving both of those challenges and it's becoming a clearer and easy platform choice. Our customers love the fact that we provide a cohesive experience across all of front office. And sometimes they'll say, look, we can't figure out where one hub ends and the other one begins. So it's very, very seamless. And we've invested in the platform. We have more than thousand integrations that have made us an easy platform choice for those upmarket customers when they even choose to integrate with others. And so I think overall you're seeing that. The other part I would say is look we have planted seeds along. I'd call ourselves seed planters and we've planted seeds along. And over the last 18 months, our product portfolio has gone broad and deep. And that means we have the sophistications of the powerful features to be able to support upmarket customers at the same time we have the breadth of the portfolio. And so, the combination of those two lead to high ASPs and higher upmarket adoption and also lower graduation rates.\nBrad Sills: That's great to hear. Thanks, Yamini. And then one more if I may. Just on the volume business, this is the strongest quarter of net ads we've seen in several quarters and you mentioned starter edition strong this quarter. Was there something behind that? This \u2013 was this kind of a one-time thing? Or is something else going on in the demand side? Thanks so much.\nKate Bueker: Yes. Thanks Brad for the question. I think, you know, what we had \u2013 what we've seen nicely is a bit \u2013 over time last year we saw a bit of a shift in new customer additions out of starter and more into professional and enterprise as we lapped those big new customer cohorts during 2020 that were primarily focused on that starter tier that really began in March of 2020. And so, this is like the first quarter where we have not a clean comp, but something that's on the road towards that. But as I mentioned, when Mark asked the question, this is very much a factor of growth addition ticking up versus anything else.\nBrad Sills: Thanks so much, Kate.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Peterson from Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nBrian Peterson: Thank you and I'll echo my congrats on the strong net add number. So the starter momentum has really been impressive. I'm curious with the relaunch Service Hub, how big of a front door could that be relative to some of the other products on the starter tier? And I'd also be curious with the new starter momentum, is that more of a single product adoption or multi hub adoption as they're going through the front door? How do we think about that?\nYamini Rangan: Yes. Great question, great question. So, if we \u2013 if I talk about the priority that we mentioned, which is we almost have like a bimodal strategy. And the way I describe it is that we have a volume motion at the lower end of our tiers and we have a value motion at the high end of the tiers. So across products and pricing, packaging and go-to-market, we're really focused on those two broad motions at HubSpot. So what you're seeing here is a starter motion, which is a full suite motion. From a product perspective, we have done a lot to make it exceptionally valuable. You saw me talk about automation down there. We are also doing much more in terms of pricing page optimization. So there's a lot that goes into the lower end. And therefore, it translates into high volume of starter suite adoption, entire suite. Now I talked in the earlier question about the upmarket where our motion is very different. There it is much more about a value play where customers might actually start with one hub and then go on a multi journey, multi hub journey with us. And certainly, Service Hub Pro helps with all of that. I think overall our product innovation that has been just on a strong cadence over the last couple of years across every one of those tiers help us execute that type of a bimodal strategy.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Turits from KeyBanc. Please go ahead.\nMichael Turits: Hi, thanks very much guys. Two things, one, first continuing on the starter motion \u2013 on the starter package adds do, is there \u2013 how do we make this year about whether or not we'll see that similar impact on ASRPC as a headwind that we saw last time around and what eventually ended up being a higher churn. How do you make sure that you get \u2013 what we see in those dynamics?\nKate Bueker: Thanks for the question, actually, one of the things that I liked a lot about the KPIs this quarter was the balance across the uptick in net additions and the increase in ASRPC that we saw within the quarter. I think about that balance as being something that is reflective of this bimodal strategy that Yamini is laying out. Historically, what I have said is that we're comfortable in and around, let's call it, 7,000 plus in quarterly net adds. And that this year we are focused on a ASRPC growth that's in the low double digits. And I continue to remain comfortable at those levels.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Turrin from Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.\nMichael Turrin: Hi, there. Thanks. Good afternoon. Nice job of the team in executing, especially given the current environment, I certainly appreciate the commentary and quantification on the FX side. I was hoping you can maybe just help us think through exposure or diversifiers across industry as well. I think some investors still think of HubSpot as tied to helping businesses digitize that are more modern. We've picked up a fairly broad-based customers across even some of the more traditional industries as you've expanded your product set. Maybe you can just help us frame from your perspective the diversification of HubSpot and your ability to just overall withstand some of the macro shocks we're seeing from an overall demand perspective. Thank you.\nKate Bueker: Yes, I very much appreciate the question. We did a lot as you can imagine of a deep dive into our customer base and the industries associated with the customer base as we navigated the early days of the pandemic. And despite digging very hard what we found was other \u2013 was the most popular of all of the categories of our customers as it relates to industries. I think we have \u2013 we are a B2B company that is broadly diverse across industries. If I were to call out anything, I would say software and services tend to be the sweet spot for us.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Parker Lane from Stifel. Please go ahead.\nParker Lane: Yes. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I wonder if we can get update on the operations hub. I know you launched some uptier versions of that in the last year. What kind of success are you seeing on that front with your internal sales teams as well as the partner channel? Thank you.\nYamini Rangan: Hi, Parker. Yes, thanks a lot for the question on ops hub. It continues to perform really nicely much of our original expectations when we launched last year. We're seeing strong customer adoption across all the tiers of ops hub. And we saw the same level of ops hub attached in March, as we saw in December, which was great. And specifically, we see a higher volume of ops hub customers coming through the starter tier as part of that sweet motion that I was just talking about. So that's certainly been the case that we've seen. And the majority of the ARR is coming through the pro and enterprise peers, which is also great to see. Now operations hub for us is very different from other hubs. Unlike marketing and sales and service, which we have really thought about as front doors, we think ops hub is a supercharger. It increases the value of all of the other hubs and I call it the sauce that makes the whole meal come together. It just makes it taste really nice. That's what ops hub is. And we think it's gaining a lot of traction with customers as well as partners and we're not done innovating. On the go-to-market side, we're continuing to invest in terms of sales enablement resources and training to get our reps and partners more familiar with use cases, creating a library of case studies and so on. And on the product side, we recently launched a bunch of more features in the enterprise tier, scheduled triggers, custom code actions, more data quality, things that really improve on that power within that enterprise tier. And so, overall, early but we are very pleased and we are hearing from both customers as well as partners that this is really helping with the adoption of the full suite.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alex Zukin from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nAlex Zukin: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to key in one more time maybe Kate on net retention. Specifically, what was the net retention for the quarter? Yes, I think, previously you've said above 110%. And given the macro picture for the year, are you still expecting that to be sustainable over the course of the year? And then I've got a quick follow up.\nKate Bueker: Yes, sure thing. You are right. The net revenue retention target that we shared at the Analyst Day last fall was 110 plus. And we were again trending nicely above 110 in Q1 with very much the same drivers of that retention strength, I guess, strong fundamental gross retention, and then really the upgrade drivers being seat expansion, cross-sell and addition upgrades. We do remain comfortable at that 110 plus for 2022.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Keith Bachman from BMO. Please go ahead.\nKeith Bachman: Hi, thank you. A nice segue from Alex question. I wanted to ask the question on the investor pervasive psychology is that marketing budgets enhance HubSpots revenue will get negatively impacted during the course of an economic downturn, particularly one that might have longer duration. And I wanted to get kind of what your response is at particularly in light of, if you look at what happened during COVID, it was a very short-lived challenge [ph] and HubSpot in fact, accelerated meaningfully in the September and December quarters after the onslaught of COVID because many of the SMBs, in fact, weren\u2019t prepared for the whole kind of work from home model and whatnot. And so there was tremendous build up capacity, but what do you see as different or similar to if we face a more prolonged economic challenge, whether it be Europe or otherwise what\u2019s different today than what happened during COVID and just to sneak one quick one, Kate is, the ads were great this quarter. It sounds like you expect them to go back to kind of sevens, but I just wanted to see if you could clarify that and that\u2019s it for me. Many thanks.\nYamini Rangan: Yes. Thanks a lot, Keith. I\u2019ll maybe start with the broader macro question and then Kate can take the specific one. Look, we\u2019re not economists and we certainly do not have a better crystal ball than any of you. But we are watching. We\u2019re watching the trends across all of this and look, if there is a really massive recession, no one is immune to that. And I think that becomes very, very clear. The thing I would say is there is a big structural change when we see customers that are adopting front office software before it was just, we need to be able to talk to our customers and we need a digital channel to be able to do that across marketing sales and service. Now it is we operate in hybrid environments and we need to continue to drive productivity and growth. And as I talk to customers, two things stand out for me this year, which is that digital transformation in the front office is not over, even though we start accelerate over the last couple of years. And maybe the tailwinds were like really gushing. It\u2019s not over. And customers that I talked to are still struggling with basics, spreadsheets, Google spreadsheets, point solutions, disconnected teams. They don\u2019t have the insights that they need to be able to drive growth. And so driving and continuing to put in technology that can provide that type of disability is going to be important in almost every environment. And then the second thing, I said this earlier, we made some really smart, strategic bets a long time ago, which was around the CRM platform. And having a platform that is just world class is really paying off right now because people want easy to implement solutions. They want quick time to implement. And if you think about HubSpot, we\u2019re able to implement in like a matter of weeks, not months and we\u2019re pretty cost effective. And so we\u2019ve become more of a platform choice in this environment. So I look, all vets are off if the economy turns completely negative, but I do think there are structural changes that are continuing to play out. And so we\u2019ll continue to lean in and focus on our priorities so that we can really build a world class CRM for scaling businesses.\nKate Bueker: Yes. And Keith, I don\u2019t want to feel like we\u2019re splitting hairs here on the net customer ads. As you\u2019ve heard us say before this, isn\u2019t a metric that we manage the business to, my comments around seven K plus is consistency versus what we\u2019ve shared in the past. I\u2019m happy to substitute seven to eight, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re particularly precise in terms of giving you some guardrails around this number.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ryan MacDonald from Needham. Please go ahead.\nRyan MacDonald: Wanted to touch on payments with them having been generally available now for five months. Can you guys give us a sense of the conversion you\u2019ve had from the pilot customers in general uptake this far and how are transaction volumes trending compared to your additional expectations? Thank you.\nYamini Rangan: Yes, payments is going great. We have a clear vision in terms of payments, which is we want to help B2B customers sell online and we want to improve the last mile of the rep assisted sale. And we\u2019ve been very focused on introducing new functionality, as well as improving the experience of customers all the way from when a customer discovers a payment link within a product to starting an application, to completing the transaction and then maybe recurring transactions. And so as you heard, we launched recurring ACH, which is a really big ask, and this will position us to capture a lot more gross payment volume, and we\u2019re definitely seeing good pickup and usage. And the early feedback from customers have been very, very encouraging, the same thing with payments dashboard that we just launched. It brings a ton of payment context into CRM and in prior calls, I\u2019ve talked a lot about our vision for having a commerce enabled CRM and having the payments object and bringing that object into CRM marketing campaigns, into sales campaigns and to support calls has going to be really valuable. And that hypothesis has been validated. Our customers are saying that is exactly what they want.  And so overall we\u2019re very happy with the feedback from our customers and traction that we\u2019re getting. And look, I\u2019ll make a broader point. I think we think of ourselves as seed planters. We always plant seeds that can grow into these giant big trees. And Brian Dharmesh planted some nice seeds few years back. And therefore we are getting a nice benefit in terms of the growth that we are seeing right now. And we\u2019ve done this multiple times with sales hub and with service hub, and we think of payments and commerce in the same vein. We\u2019re planting the seeds, we are nurturing it. We\u2019re getting really good feedback. We\u2019re continuing to maintain our pace of innovation. And this is something that\u2019s going to provide us a lot of shade as we go forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nElizabeth Porter: Hi, this is Elizabeth Porter on for Keith Weiss. I just wanted to ask a little bit on the average subscription revenue per customer. So it was a bit of an acceleration and growth. So if you could just unpack what were some of the drivers of that, especially given that some of the new customer ads sounded more that this Starter suite. Thank you.\nYamini Rangan: Yes, thanks so much for the question. I think I would call it two main drivers of the ASRPC growth. One is just the continuation of multi-hub adoption that we\u2019re seeing across our customer base. And the second is the traction that we\u2019re seeing at the enterprise tier. Those two things are really the primary catalysts for that growth in ASRPC.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Arjun Bhatia from William Blair. Please go ahead.\nArjun Bhatia: Perfect. Thank you. Yamini, I wanted to maybe go back to Europe. I think you had said earlier that there was some small pockets of delays in Europe in terms of purchasing decisions. I\u2019d be curious if you have a granular, more granular insight into whether that\u2019s Eastern Europe or you\u2019re seeing that, or is it spreading to Western Europe, given the impact of the war there and, to follow onto that, does that impact your international investment decision at all this year? I did see international growth outpaced domestic growth, but just curious how you\u2019re thinking of that, given the geopolitical uncertainty there.\nYamini Rangan: Yes. Thanks for that question. First off, I will say that, my heart goes out to Ukraine and the millions of people that are impacted by the Russian invasion and specifically there, we have been supporting our HubSpot community and providing relief through organizations that are doing some really important work on the ground. In terms of direct impact, we don\u2019t have employees, but we have some contractors in that region and we passed all sales into Russia. In terms of scoping, we have less than 200 customers and about 0.5% of ARR combined across Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus so very small direct impact from that region. Then your question more broadly on international and Europe Q1 was a very good quarter for us, as you saw from the results, international grew 53% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. And what I mentioned was that we saw a few delays in purchasing decisions. Mostly took one or two additional conversations, but once again it is not material in terms of growth at this point. And I will reiterate, of the things there, if all of this worsens, then it\u2019s \u2013 we can\u2019t really control any of that, but we are controlling the controllables. We have focused efforts in terms of the priorities. I laid out the priorities we are investing in terms of the priorities. And we always look at this as long term bets. We don\u2019t look at it as quarterly bets. So the investments that we make in international are how do we kind of continue to grow the region and grow our presence in the region for the longer haul.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kirk Materne from Evercore. Please go ahead.\nKirk Materne: Yes. Thanks very much for taking the question. Yamini, I was wondering if you could just talk about the upmarket opportunity for you all, if there\u2019s anything you\u2019re seeing, that\u2019s different in say the U.S. versus Europe or international markets in terms of bundling, Europe would seem to be actually an area where there\u2019s potentially more Greenfield where customers haven\u2019t made as many decisions across as many hubs. So I was just kind of curious if there\u2019s any real difference in how sort of the bundle strategy plays out internationally versus the U.S.? Thanks.\nYamini Rangan: That\u2019s a good question. I would say that more broadly, we think about it as the volume play and the value play that I talked about, when we think about our segmentation strategy in the lower end of our market, everything that we do is to remove friction from the product, from the customer experience, from the go-to-market perspective and upmarket, everything that we do is driving value for our customers. And it\u2019s a similar set of strategies in place that we drive upmarket in North America, as we do in Europe. Now, to your point, we do think that the European market is a little bit behind, in terms of digital transformation. So there are more Greenfield opportunities, more opportunities where there are maybe currently using spreadsheets or they are have a point solution, and they\u2019re looking to drive that. And we are certainly see that within the market, but overall our approach to the value side of our sales play is build fantastic products, continue to solve for our customer\u2019s biggest problem and enable our partner channel as well as direct channel to have great conversations that drive multi-hub growth.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brent Bracelin from Piper Sandler.\nYamini Rangan: Dharmesh, go ahead, add your comment.\nDharmesh Shah: Yes, I was just going to add a comment on the upmarket in terms of international. One thing we\u2019ve also seen recently is an uptick in kind of our platform usage and our integration partners specifically with local app developers in these regional markets. So we\u2019ve been kind of focused on increasing the number of integrations overall, which are up over a 1,000. That\u2019s been growing very nicely, but specifically for our kind of local application partners that are in region we\u2019ve seen 80% year-over-year growth in terms of number of those integrations. And I think that\u2019s really helping us as far as up market adoption.\nOperator: Brent Bracelin, your line is open. Please go ahead.\nClarke Jeffries: Thank you. This is Clarke Jeffries on for Brent. I wanted to ask about the hiring environment, what you\u2019re seeing right now in terms of acquiring talent. And then additionally, maybe about the appetites pursue tuck-in acquisitions to accelerate innovation [indiscernible] hubs or potentially new hubs. I appreciate that you wouldn\u2019t want to impact the user experience by bolting on poorly integrated features, but how are you weighing M&A as an opportunity to kind of accelerate that innovation versus the number of internal initiatives you have running right now?\nYamini Rangan: Yes. Thanks a lot. Maybe I\u2019ll start with the hiring question and then take the broader question on M&A and how we view that. I\u2019d say look, the talent market is definitely competitive. We see that, but it\u2019s not necessarily a new phenomena. As you saw, in Q1, we hired 41% more and we ended the headcount at 6,400. So we\u2019ve been able to hire some incredible talent, even in a very, very competitive market that we have. And I would really, point to the strong culture that we have of listening, learning, and evolving. That is a real big part of the culture. And we think of culture as important as product. And so we pay a lot of attention to the net promoter score on the product side, and we pay a lot of attention to the employee net promoter score on the culture side. And that means that when we hear things, we certainly listen to it and then we go back and we\u2019re able to kind of make sure that the culture\u2019s evolving as we continue to scale. And so our commitment to our people is really, really key in this environment and has really helped us hire retain top talent and will continue to do that. It\u2019s not a one and done.  In terms of the broader question on M&A, I think you said it right. For us we\u2019ve taken a very, very different path to crafting a CRM solution. And in times like this, in times, almost many time, it is a real value proposition that resonates within our segment of customers. Our customers don\u2019t want to spend a ton of time, ton of money, ton of resources, ton of IT, to be able to hobble things together. And so our crafted experience and platform has resonated and continues to resonate. So when we think about M&A, we\u2019ll certainly look at it and \u2013 but we want to maintain and enhance the customer experience. And when we do look at M&A, it\u2019ll be more from the perspective of accelerating one of our primary colors, which is within our HubSpot framework or maybe adding a new primary color and so continue to look at it. But the crafted experience is something that we really deeply care about and believe in.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ryan MacWilliams from Barclays. Your line is open\nRyan MacWilliams: Thanks for taking the question. So we noticed the price increase on the professional tier of service hub recently, and this may have been a part of the service hub relaunch, but as we enter possibly a more inflationary environment, is there an opportunity here to take advantage of price in some of your other products? Thanks.\nYamini Rangan: Yes. A great question. Good, top of mind question in terms of pricing and you\u2019re absolutely right. We did change the service hub pricing from 400 per month to 500 per month based on all of the features and functionality that we just re-launch. And I\u2019d say, look, I think, we are going to stay consistent with our pricing and packaging philosophy. And our pricing philosophy is that we add value to customers. And when we know we have added value and when our customers have received a tremendous amount of value, then we look at pricing changes, and that\u2019s exactly what we did with the service hub pricing increase that you just mentioned. And the other part of our overall packaging strategy is that we\u2019ll continue to pour innovation. We want to build just exceptionally powerful features on the enterprise tier, and we want to keep bringing down those features, high-end features into starter and professional addition so that our customers can get the value from all the innovation that we are doing. And that\u2019s our consistent pricing and packaging strategy will remain focused to that strategy. And when we deliver value to customers is then we will make changes to pricing.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Terry Tillman from Truist Securities. Please go ahead.\nConnor Passarella: Hey, good afternoon, team. This is Connor Passarella on for Terry. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to ask one around the partner ecosystem. So as you continue to push up market and see enterprise customers adopting a multi hub strategy what kinds of synergies are you seeing with the stronger communication between the partner ecosystem and your direct sales team? I then people kind of impacts are customers experiencing from a strengthened co-selling motion. Thank you.\nYamini Rangan: Yes, thanks a lot for the question. The partner ecosystem has contributed about 40% of our overall ARR, and that continues to be the case. So very strong synergies there. And as we have really transformed from being a marketing automation company to a CRM platform, and as we have transformed from really being a small business company to a mid-market company, which is both of these are pretty big transformations. We\u2019ve really enrolled our partner ecosystem in that transformation. And we have enabled them to come along with us and we\u2019ve made a ton of investment. So overall our strategy that we have clearly communicated to the partner ecosystem is we want to scale selling and servicing with that partner ecosystem. And I think it\u2019s going really well. I talk to partners a lot and I know some of you do as well. And what I hear from that is that the CRM platform scaling is going well. Our customers definitely clearly see the need for a platform and our partners are able to help. When our partners get engaged with customers, customer dollar retention, improves revenue retention improves, and the multi-hub adoption improves. And so it\u2019s a win for customers. It\u2019s a win for partners and therefore it\u2019s a win for HubSpot. So I\u2019m pretty excited about how the partner ecosystem is coming along with us.\nDharmesh Shah: Yes, just a quick note Yamini is around, the platform itself we have three different dimensions of value that the platform allows our partners to create. One, we\u2019ve talked about a lot, which is the app integration partners, and that creates value not just for the company developing those applications, but also our solutions partners that help kind of make those integrations come to life. The second dimension of value is around creating assets that work within the HubSpot platform. So we have CMS hub templates now. So a web design firm could create a template for a particular industry that works with CMS hub, therefore driving down that kind of time to enjoyment. And the third one is around customizing the HubSpot platform, which we\u2019ve been continuing making more and more investments in to make the platform more extensible. And this creates another wave of opportunity, other dimension of values that our solutions partners can kind of bring to our customers and really bring value there. So all three of those things are exciting. We hear from partners all the time but the HubSpot platform is kind of unlocking more and more value for them over time.\nOperator: Our final question comes from Taylor McGinnis from UBS. Your line is open.\nTaylor McGinnis: Yes. Hi, thanks so much for squeezing my question. And so Kate earlier you spoke about comfort with ASRPC growth remaining in the low double digits. So could you maybe just talk about, what\u2019s giving you comfort with the durability of this metric, just given some of the earlier comments you made with Starter being strong in net ads this past quarter, and just as the comps for this metric, get tougher as, as we go throughout the year. And maybe it\u2019s like a second part to this question is just, I would imagine the mix of Starter versus some of the premium tiers has a role there. So curious how you\u2019re thinking about that mix evolving throughout the year.\nKate Bueker: Yes. Thanks for the, the question I would say, you\u2019ve heard us talk a lot about the strength of the install based selling motion that we\u2019ve seen over the last three or four quarters. Yamini talked a lot about the innovation that we\u2019ve been pouring into the product at the high end and in introducing new hubs that creates a lot of opportunity for our sales team to go into our customer base and find opportunity to deliver more value to them. That is a natural tailwind to ASRPC and provides a nice balance to any incremental uptick in that Starter tier.\nOperator: We have no further questions. I am going to hand back to Yamini Rangan, CEO for closing remarks.\nYamini Rangan: Well, I want to finish off by thanking all of our customers, our partners, employees, as well as the investors. Thank you so much for your support. We really appreciate it. HubSpot appreciates it. And we look forward to talking to you again next quarter.\nOperator: Today\u2019s call has now concluded. We\u2019d like to thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "content": "Yes, I was just going to add a comment on the upmarket in terms of international. One thing we've also seen recently is an uptick in kind of our platform usage and our integration partners specifically with local app developers in these regional markets. So we've been kind of focused on increasing the number of integrations overall, which are up over a 1,000. That's been growing very nicely, but specifically for our kind of local application partners that are in region we've seen 80% year-over-year growth in terms of number of those integrations. And I think that's really helping us as far as up market adoption. Yes, just a quick note Yamini is around, the platform itself we have three different dimensions of value that the platform allows our partners to create. One, we've talked about a lot, which is the app integration partners, and that creates value not just for the company developing those applications, but also our solutions partners that help kind of make those integrations come to life. The second dimension of value is around creating assets that work within the HubSpot platform. So we have CMS hub templates now. So a web design firm could create a template for a particular industry that works with CMS hub, therefore driving down that kind of time to enjoyment. And the third one is around customizing the HubSpot platform, which we've been continuing making more and more investments in to make the platform more extensible. And this creates another wave of opportunity, other dimension of values that our solutions partners can kind of bring to our customers and really bring value there. So all three of those things are exciting. We hear from partners all the time but the HubSpot platform is kind of unlocking more and more value for them over time."

            "content": "Thanks, Yamini. Let's turn to our first quarter 2022 financial results. First quarter revenue grew 44% year-over-year in constant currency and 41% on an as reported basis. Q1 subscription revenue grew 42% year-over-year, while services and other revenue decreased 4% on an as reported basis. Domestic revenue grew 37% year-over-year in Q1, while international revenue growth was 53% in constant currency and 44% as reported. International revenue as a percentage of total revenue increased by one point year-over-year to 46% in Q1. We added 8,200 net new customers in the quarter bringing our total customer count to over 143,000, up 26% year-over-year. Average subscription revenue per customer grew 12% year-over-year to just over $11,000, driven primarily by continued multi-hub adoption and strength in our enterprise tier. Deferred revenue as of the end of March was $463 million, a 36% increase year-over-year. Calculated billings were $423 million in Q1, growing 41% year-over-year in constant currency and 39% as reported. Consistent with trends we've seen in prior quarters, constant currency revenue growth exceeded constant currency billings growth in Q1, primarily as a result of the strong install base selling mix in the quarter and a lower overall billing duration. The remainder of my comments will refer to non-GAAP measures. First quarter gross margin was 82%, up one point year-over-year. Subscription gross margin was 85% in Q1, while services and other gross margin was negative 19%. First quarter operating margin was 9%, up two points compared to last year. Net income in the first quarter was $28 million or $0.54 per fully diluted share. At the end of the first quarter, we had 6,400 employees, up 41% year-over-year. CapEx, including capitalized software development cost was $20 million or 5% of revenue in Q1 and free cash flow in the quarter was $63 million or 16% of revenue. Finally, our cash and marketable securities totaled $1.4 billion at the end of March. Before I turn to our outlook, I wanted to highlight the impact of foreign currency translation on our as reported financial results. The U.S. dollar strengthened sharply throughout Q1 and into May. This has created a meaningful, incremental headwind to our 2022 as reported revenue and non-GAAP operating profit relative to the guidance we provided on our February earnings call. At current spot rates, we now expect FX to negatively impact full year revenue growth by five points up from our prior expectations of a three-point headwind and to create a headwind to non-GAAP operating profit margin of approximately a half a percentage point. And with that, let's dive into guidance for the second quarter and full year of 2022. For the second quarter, total as reported revenue is expected to be in the range of $409 to $410 million, up 32% year-over-year at the midpoint. We expect FX to be a six point headwind to as reported revenue growth in the second quarter. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be between $27 million and $28 million. Non-GAAP diluted net income per share is expected to be between $0.42 and $0.44. This assumes 51.2 million fully diluted shares outstanding. And for the full year of 2022, total as reported revenue is now expected to be in the range of $1.722 billion to $1.728 billion, up 33% year-over-year at the mid point. As I mentioned, we now expect FX to be a five-point headwind to as reported revenue growth for the full year of 2022, representing an incremental 30 million headwind to 2022 as reported revenue from our prior forecast. Non-GAAP operating income is now expected to be between $152 million and $154 million. This includes approximately $10 million or a half percent margin impact from the incremental FX headwind. Non-GAAP diluted net income per share is now expected to be between $2.40 and $2.42. This assumes 51.5 million fully diluted shares outstanding. As you adjust your models, keep in mind the following. We continue to expect CapEx as a percentage of revenue to be roughly 6% and now anticipate free cash flow to be about 230 million for the full year of 2022, including a headwind of about $10 million from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to our prior estimate. And with that, I'll hand things back over to Yamini for her closing remarks. Maybe Mark I'll jump in and talk specifically to the customer as we were obviously happy to see the net new customer edition sort of pop back up above 8,000 for the quarter. The growth we're seeing quarter-over-quarter is really being driven at that starter tier. And we are \u2013 we saw within the quarter a positive uptick and gross additions at the starter level. Yes, it's an interesting question Samad [Audio Dip] has over time become kind of a natural shape to the retention curve within a quarter where you tend to have more of the install base up for renewal in the third month. And so, what happens there is you have a bit of a lower gross retention in the third month and a bit of more upsell opportunity, so a bit of a higher net revenue retention as you finish the quarter and that is very much what we saw in Q1. Yes. Thanks Brad for the question. I think, you know, what we had \u2013 what we've seen nicely is a bit \u2013 over time last year we saw a bit of a shift in new customer additions out of starter and more into professional and enterprise as we lapped those big new customer cohorts during 2020 that were primarily focused on that starter tier that really began in March of 2020. And so, this is like the first quarter where we have not a clean comp, but something that's on the road towards that. But as I mentioned, when Mark asked the question, this is very much a factor of growth addition ticking up versus anything else. Thanks for the question, actually, one of the things that I liked a lot about the KPIs this quarter was the balance across the uptick in net additions and the increase in ASRPC that we saw within the quarter. I think about that balance as being something that is reflective of this bimodal strategy that Yamini is laying out. Historically, what I have said is that we're comfortable in and around, let's call it, 7,000 plus in quarterly net adds. And that this year we are focused on a ASRPC growth that's in the low double digits. And I continue to remain comfortable at those levels. Yes, I very much appreciate the question. We did a lot as you can imagine of a deep dive into our customer base and the industries associated with the customer base as we navigated the early days of the pandemic. And despite digging very hard what we found was other \u2013 was the most popular of all of the categories of our customers as it relates to industries. I think we have \u2013 we are a B2B company that is broadly diverse across industries. If I were to call out anything, I would say software and services tend to be the sweet spot for us. Yes, sure thing. You are right. The net revenue retention target that we shared at the Analyst Day last fall was 110 plus. And we were again trending nicely above 110 in Q1 with very much the same drivers of that retention strength, I guess, strong fundamental gross retention, and then really the upgrade drivers being seat expansion, cross-sell and addition upgrades. We do remain comfortable at that 110 plus for 2022. Yes. And Keith, I don't want to feel like we're splitting hairs here on the net customer ads. As you've heard us say before this, isn't a metric that we manage the business to, my comments around seven K plus is consistency versus what we've shared in the past. I'm happy to substitute seven to eight, I don't think we're particularly precise in terms of giving you some guardrails around this number. Yes. Thanks for the, the question I would say, you've heard us talk a lot about the strength of the install based selling motion that we've seen over the last three or four quarters. Yamini talked a lot about the innovation that we've been pouring into the product at the high end and in introducing new hubs that creates a lot of opportunity for our sales team to go into our customer base and find opportunity to deliver more value to them. That is a natural tailwind to ASRPC and provides a nice balance to any incremental uptick in that Starter tier."

            "name": "Yamini Rangan",
            "content": "Thank you, Chuck, and welcome everyone. Thank you for joining us today as we review HubSpot's first quarter 2022 results. To start off, I first want to acknowledge the devastating situation in Ukraine. We're deeply saddened by the Russian invasion and our hearts go out to the people of Ukraine. With this war and ongoing pandemic in volatile markets, it's clear that we continue to live in a time of great uncertainty. 2022 is a year of focus and consistency at HubSpot for that exact reason. With that backdrop, now let's talk through HubSpot's first quarter results. HubSpot saw strong performance across the business with revenue growing 44% in constant currency year-over-year in the first quarter and total customers growing 26% year-over-year to more than 143,000 customers globally. These results prove that HubSpot continues to be mission critical for our customers. The pandemic accelerated digital transformation and fundamentally transformed the way companies could buy and sell. Our customers are faced with hybrid work, decentralized teams and disconnected systems, creating a significant growth challenge. As a result, they're realizing it's even more important to have a single unified view of the customer in order to grow. That's why our customers continue to choose HubSpot. We provide a connected easy to use platform that enables growth. In 2022, we're continuing to focus on helping our customers grow and executing on our clear growth strategy. We've previously shared the four strategic priorities guiding our paths to becoming the number one CRM platform for scaling companies. Now, I want to walk you through the meaningful progress we made over the past quarter in each of those areas. Our first strategic priority is to deliver a world-class front office platform by investing in our anchor hubs and innovating with new emerging hubs. We recently crossed two important milestones on this front. First off, I'm thrilled to report that Marketing Hub surpassed $1 billion in annual recurring revenue in the first quarter. We've built a world-class marketing automation platform that's powerful and easy to use. And over the past couple of years, we've made significant investments to better serve all of our customer segments. We've enhanced the onboarding and user experience and introduced simple automation functionality to free and starter tiers. To serve the higher end of the market, we rolled out business units and advanced reporting capabilities that drive deeper insights. These investments have enabled Marketing Hub to achieve significant scale of $1 billion in ARR and now we have the opportunity to replicate the success across all of our anchor hubs. HubSpot operates in markets with very large TAMs. And when we build world-class products that solve for our customers like Marketing Hub, we see scale. I'm incredibly excited about this milestone and the opportunity ahead for HubSpot. The second milestone is that we recently relaunched Service Hub with expanded features and functionality. In today's hybrid world, customers expect a service experience that's human and exceptional. We build service up to enable small medium businesses to deliver that kind of exceptional service. Our Service Hub strategy is threefold: build a modern support center, deliver omnichannel support and drive AI powered automation and insights. As part of the relaunch in March, we introduced service level agreements, a mobile helpdesk and support workspace to fuel a modern support center. To power omnichannel support, we added customer portals, live chat, Facebook messenger and email functionality. And to provide our customers with richer automation and insights, we added feedback surveys and ticket automation. I'm also pleased to share that inbound calling is now generally available to service and Sales Hub customers as of this week. We believe this will empower our customers to provide an even more authentic service in real-time. I'm excited by the early feedback we are hearing from our customers about the new features and the value that they're seeing from Service Hub. One that customer is Dake, a trusted name in metalworking manufacturing since 1887. Their legacy customer service system was holding them back from providing a level of service that matched the quality of their products. So Dake started with Marketing Hub and Sales Hub, they saw a ton of value from HubSpot and expanded to Service Hub as a result. Dake now use this shared inboxes to gain visibility into customer interactions throughout the journey and leverages automation to streamline all of the manual tasks all of which increases their productivity. With Service Hub, Dake has improved their customer satisfaction score by 13 points up to 87%. This illustrates how a connected platform makes it possible to remove friction and deliver an incredible customer experience. Now, let's talk about our second strategic priority, which is to strengthen our segmentation approach across both product and go-to-market. Our approach here is twofold. We want to drive volume at the lower end of the market with products that are easy to buy and easy to use and we want to fuel value on the higher end with robust features for customers with sophisticated needs. In Q1, we made a few key investments here. On the lower end, we introduced simple automation for free and started tiers as I mentioned earlier. In addition to that, we are running experiments like pricing page optimization and self guided demos. These investments are resulting in strong adoption of our Starter suite. Within our upmarket segment, both our direct sales team and partner channel are focused on driving multi-hub sales and the investments we are making are beginning to pay off. We're seeing multi-hub adoption grow with 24% of our professional and enterprise customers now using three or more hubs. Looking ahead, we'll continue to focus on making HubSpot, an easy choice for scaling businesses and driving multi-hub adoption upmarket. Our third strategic priority is to invest in payments and commerce. As more businesses become digital first, having a native payment solution is critical for SMBs to grow. On our last call, I shared that HubSpot payments had just become generally available in the U.S. for B2B customers. I'm pleased to share that we've already expanded the offering with the addition of recurring ACH functionality and payments dashboard and objects, which are currently in beta. Payments object is a top requested feature because it really enables customers to see commerce data in all of their CRM interactions, delivering an even more unified view of their customers' journey. We're continuing to hear positive feedback from customers confirming the opportunity we see to empower businesses with a commerce enabled CRM. That said, we're early in our payments journey and our focus remains on building the features and functionality our customers need to help them grow. Moving on our fourth and final strategic priority is to build a sustainable company. An important part of that journey is hiring and developing diverse talent. In the last quarter, we released our annual diversity report and I want to celebrate how far we've come as a company. Today, 47% of HubSpot employees globally identify as women or non-binary, up seven points over the past five years. In the U.S. 35% of employees identify as BIPOC, up 20 points from 2017. Additionally, we have four women on our executive leadership team, particularly proud of that. And 70% of our Board identifies as a woman or person of color. I'm incredibly proud of how far we've come and we'll continue to work towards building a company that reflects the diversity of our customers. With that, I'll turn it over to Kate to give an overview of our financial results for the quarter. Kate, take it away. Thank you so much, Kate. I want to close out by sharing two exciting developments on HubSpot's leadership team and Board. First, we recently welcome Rob Giglio as HubSpot's new Chief Customer Officer. Rob is a customer centric multidisciplinary leader who has seen tremendous scale from his time at Adobe and DocuSign. His expertise across marketing, sales and operations will meaningfully help a HubSpot scale, our go-to-market strategy through this next phase of growth. We're also thrilled that Claire Hughes Johnson, former COO of Stripe, joined our board this past quarter. We have so much to learn from her expertise scaling businesses, especially in the payment space. I'm confident we have the right team to execute on our vision of helping millions of organizations grow. And I'm really excited about the impact both Rob and Claire will have on our business. Looking ahead, our plan is to stay focused and execute on our four strategic priorities in 2022 to continue driving value for our customers, partners, employees and shareholders. With that operator please open up the call for some questions. Hi, Mark. Thanks lot for your question. Look like everyone else we are paying attention to all of the macro trends. We're watching interest rates. We're watching inflation. We're watching in demand trends more broadly. In terms of the impact, Mark, we saw some pockets of delays in purchasing decisions among customers, mostly in Europe. Now having said that and while the macroeconomic environment could change, it has not been a material headwind to the growth of our business. And more fundamentally, we're seeing a big secular change where customers are investing in front-office software to drive productivity and growth. And as you know, our customers leaned into technology during the pandemic to stay very, very connected to their end customers. And what I'm seeing now is that they're continuing to lean into technology as they operate in this hybrid world and drive productivity. And I think more specifically, we made a CRM bet a few years ago and that bet is working. Our product innovation is in high gear as you just heard me talk about the innovation that we \u2013 with the features we launched and relaunched this quarter, we're seeing customers consolidates on HubSpot because we are quick to implement, we're easy to use and we are easy to adopt and our value proposition is resonating within our customer base. Hey, Gabriela, thanks for that question. I'm very excited about the Service Hub relaunch and the long list of new features that we launched. I think it's going to be a game changing for Service Hub, but more importantly it's just going to be game changing for the entire CRM platform because the combination of marketing sales and Service Hub becomes even more powerful. So I'd say that, our focus when we relaunched a Service Hub is just simple. We want our SMBs to be able to deliver just exceptional service. And what you saw deliver this quarter is a three pronged product strategy, which is to build a modern support center, deliver just omnichannel support and provide AI powered automation and insights like ticket predictions and smart routing and conversation intelligence. So, overall, we launched a ton of features that are going to be pretty big needle movers for SMBs. The reaction has been very, very positive. We see it in both kind of demand trends for Service Hub as well as feature usage. In fact, our ticketing usage has gone up since the relaunch and that shows that customers are getting a lot of value from the features that we released. And if I step back, I see three big opportunities that begin to accelerate with this relaunch. First, I think, we accelerate all of this cross-sell opportunity within the install base. So I can see Marketing Hub customers, Sales Hub customers, who've seen value from our platform, lean into Service Hub. Second, as I've mentioned, multi-hub adoption is a pretty big lever for us and Service Hub relaunch should bolster our ability to sell three plus hub deals. And then longer term, this is an important milestone for Service Hub to become alleged mid front door. So overall, very excited about this relaunch, but also hearing very good feedback from our partner community as well as our customers. Hi, Samad, yes, thanks a lot for the question. We're pretty excited about that important milestone. First off I'd say like marketing operates in a mega market. This is a market with a very large TAM and still low single-digit penetration. So I feel like there is plenty of opportunity and runway for us to grow and we see significant growth with Marketing Hub, but there is also a runway for us to build a multi-billion dollar business here. And as I talk to customers, it is clear that marketing needs have not remained static. And therefore marketing innovation is not remaining static. Almost every company is now looking for ways to drive more effectiveness in marketing, looking to support more channels. It's becoming much more omnichannel and marketing, more campaign visibility and more cohesion for the rest of the go-to-market, including sales and service. And so, we're not sitting still. On the product front, our focus is to drive that type of omnichannel marketing, which our customers need drive more advanced automation and a lot more reporting. We're doing all of this while maintaining that ease of use. And in fact, this is something that I was very excited about. Marketing Hub recently earned the number one spot in the TrustRadius 10 most Loved Products in 2022. That's just a great testament to the powerful and yet easy to use platforms that we're building in marketing. And then on the go-to-market side, Samad, Marketing Hub is in almost every marketing automation conversation within our segment. It's become a great front door, but more importantly it's becoming a de-facto standard within the customer segments that we're focused on. So we definitely feel very positive and there is plenty of runway left for marketing to grow. There is also a great playbook for the other anchor hubs to follow. So, happy about the results. Brad, thanks a lot for that question. And I think you're hitting on the right area. So if you peel back the onion and look at upmarket, there is a huge challenge for mid-market companies to stitch together, very disparate systems that don't work well. They don't have the time, they don't have the budget, they don't have the technical team sitting around and that's a fundamental challenge. They also have a challenge of being able to get clear visibility across their entire journey from marketing, from sales, from service, and they need that to be able to grow in any environment. And so I think, fundamentally, what is happening is that HubSpot is solving both of those challenges and it's becoming a clearer and easy platform choice. Our customers love the fact that we provide a cohesive experience across all of front office. And sometimes they'll say, look, we can't figure out where one hub ends and the other one begins. So it's very, very seamless. And we've invested in the platform. We have more than thousand integrations that have made us an easy platform choice for those upmarket customers when they even choose to integrate with others. And so I think overall you're seeing that. The other part I would say is look we have planted seeds along. I'd call ourselves seed planters and we've planted seeds along. And over the last 18 months, our product portfolio has gone broad and deep. And that means we have the sophistications of the powerful features to be able to support upmarket customers at the same time we have the breadth of the portfolio. And so, the combination of those two lead to high ASPs and higher upmarket adoption and also lower graduation rates. Yes. Great question, great question. So, if we \u2013 if I talk about the priority that we mentioned, which is we almost have like a bimodal strategy. And the way I describe it is that we have a volume motion at the lower end of our tiers and we have a value motion at the high end of the tiers. So across products and pricing, packaging and go-to-market, we're really focused on those two broad motions at HubSpot. So what you're seeing here is a starter motion, which is a full suite motion. From a product perspective, we have done a lot to make it exceptionally valuable. You saw me talk about automation down there. We are also doing much more in terms of pricing page optimization. So there's a lot that goes into the lower end. And therefore, it translates into high volume of starter suite adoption, entire suite. Now I talked in the earlier question about the upmarket where our motion is very different. There it is much more about a value play where customers might actually start with one hub and then go on a multi journey, multi hub journey with us. And certainly, Service Hub Pro helps with all of that. I think overall our product innovation that has been just on a strong cadence over the last couple of years across every one of those tiers help us execute that type of a bimodal strategy. Hi, Parker. Yes, thanks a lot for the question on ops hub. It continues to perform really nicely much of our original expectations when we launched last year. We're seeing strong customer adoption across all the tiers of ops hub. And we saw the same level of ops hub attached in March, as we saw in December, which was great. And specifically, we see a higher volume of ops hub customers coming through the starter tier as part of that sweet motion that I was just talking about. So that's certainly been the case that we've seen. And the majority of the ARR is coming through the pro and enterprise peers, which is also great to see. Now operations hub for us is very different from other hubs. Unlike marketing and sales and service, which we have really thought about as front doors, we think ops hub is a supercharger. It increases the value of all of the other hubs and I call it the sauce that makes the whole meal come together. It just makes it taste really nice. That's what ops hub is. And we think it's gaining a lot of traction with customers as well as partners and we're not done innovating. On the go-to-market side, we're continuing to invest in terms of sales enablement resources and training to get our reps and partners more familiar with use cases, creating a library of case studies and so on. And on the product side, we recently launched a bunch of more features in the enterprise tier, scheduled triggers, custom code actions, more data quality, things that really improve on that power within that enterprise tier. And so, overall, early but we are very pleased and we are hearing from both customers as well as partners that this is really helping with the adoption of the full suite. Yes. Thanks a lot, Keith. I'll maybe start with the broader macro question and then Kate can take the specific one. Look, we're not economists and we certainly do not have a better crystal ball than any of you. But we are watching. We're watching the trends across all of this and look, if there is a really massive recession, no one is immune to that. And I think that becomes very, very clear. The thing I would say is there is a big structural change when we see customers that are adopting front office software before it was just, we need to be able to talk to our customers and we need a digital channel to be able to do that across marketing sales and service. Now it is we operate in hybrid environments and we need to continue to drive productivity and growth. And as I talk to customers, two things stand out for me this year, which is that digital transformation in the front office is not over, even though we start accelerate over the last couple of years. And maybe the tailwinds were like really gushing. It's not over. And customers that I talked to are still struggling with basics, spreadsheets, Google spreadsheets, point solutions, disconnected teams. They don't have the insights that they need to be able to drive growth. And so driving and continuing to put in technology that can provide that type of disability is going to be important in almost every environment. And then the second thing, I said this earlier, we made some really smart, strategic bets a long time ago, which was around the CRM platform. And having a platform that is just world class is really paying off right now because people want easy to implement solutions. They want quick time to implement. And if you think about HubSpot, we're able to implement in like a matter of weeks, not months and we're pretty cost effective. And so we've become more of a platform choice in this environment. So I look, all vets are off if the economy turns completely negative, but I do think there are structural changes that are continuing to play out. And so we'll continue to lean in and focus on our priorities so that we can really build a world class CRM for scaling businesses. Yes, payments is going great. We have a clear vision in terms of payments, which is we want to help B2B customers sell online and we want to improve the last mile of the rep assisted sale. And we've been very focused on introducing new functionality, as well as improving the experience of customers all the way from when a customer discovers a payment link within a product to starting an application, to completing the transaction and then maybe recurring transactions. And so as you heard, we launched recurring ACH, which is a really big ask, and this will position us to capture a lot more gross payment volume, and we're definitely seeing good pickup and usage. And the early feedback from customers have been very, very encouraging, the same thing with payments dashboard that we just launched. It brings a ton of payment context into CRM and in prior calls, I've talked a lot about our vision for having a commerce enabled CRM and having the payments object and bringing that object into CRM marketing campaigns, into sales campaigns and to support calls has going to be really valuable. And that hypothesis has been validated. Our customers are saying that is exactly what they want.  And so overall we're very happy with the feedback from our customers and traction that we're getting. And look, I'll make a broader point. I think we think of ourselves as seed planters. We always plant seeds that can grow into these giant big trees. And Brian Dharmesh planted some nice seeds few years back. And therefore we are getting a nice benefit in terms of the growth that we are seeing right now. And we've done this multiple times with sales hub and with service hub, and we think of payments and commerce in the same vein. We're planting the seeds, we are nurturing it. We're getting really good feedback. We're continuing to maintain our pace of innovation. And this is something that's going to provide us a lot of shade as we go forward. Yes, thanks so much for the question. I think I would call it two main drivers of the ASRPC growth. One is just the continuation of multi-hub adoption that we're seeing across our customer base. And the second is the traction that we're seeing at the enterprise tier. Those two things are really the primary catalysts for that growth in ASRPC. Yes. Thanks for that question. First off, I will say that, my heart goes out to Ukraine and the millions of people that are impacted by the Russian invasion and specifically there, we have been supporting our HubSpot community and providing relief through organizations that are doing some really important work on the ground. In terms of direct impact, we don't have employees, but we have some contractors in that region and we passed all sales into Russia. In terms of scoping, we have less than 200 customers and about 0.5% of ARR combined across Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus so very small direct impact from that region. Then your question more broadly on international and Europe Q1 was a very good quarter for us, as you saw from the results, international grew 53% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. And what I mentioned was that we saw a few delays in purchasing decisions. Mostly took one or two additional conversations, but once again it is not material in terms of growth at this point. And I will reiterate, of the things there, if all of this worsens, then it's \u2013 we can't really control any of that, but we are controlling the controllables. We have focused efforts in terms of the priorities. I laid out the priorities we are investing in terms of the priorities. And we always look at this as long term bets. We don't look at it as quarterly bets. So the investments that we make in international are how do we kind of continue to grow the region and grow our presence in the region for the longer haul. That's a good question. I would say that more broadly, we think about it as the volume play and the value play that I talked about, when we think about our segmentation strategy in the lower end of our market, everything that we do is to remove friction from the product, from the customer experience, from the go-to-market perspective and upmarket, everything that we do is driving value for our customers. And it's a similar set of strategies in place that we drive upmarket in North America, as we do in Europe. Now, to your point, we do think that the European market is a little bit behind, in terms of digital transformation. So there are more Greenfield opportunities, more opportunities where there are maybe currently using spreadsheets or they are have a point solution, and they're looking to drive that. And we are certainly see that within the market, but overall our approach to the value side of our sales play is build fantastic products, continue to solve for our customer's biggest problem and enable our partner channel as well as direct channel to have great conversations that drive multi-hub growth. Dharmesh, go ahead, add your comment. Yes. Thanks a lot. Maybe I'll start with the hiring question and then take the broader question on M&A and how we view that. I'd say look, the talent market is definitely competitive. We see that, but it's not necessarily a new phenomena. As you saw, in Q1, we hired 41% more and we ended the headcount at 6,400. So we've been able to hire some incredible talent, even in a very, very competitive market that we have. And I would really, point to the strong culture that we have of listening, learning, and evolving. That is a real big part of the culture. And we think of culture as important as product. And so we pay a lot of attention to the net promoter score on the product side, and we pay a lot of attention to the employee net promoter score on the culture side. And that means that when we hear things, we certainly listen to it and then we go back and we're able to kind of make sure that the culture's evolving as we continue to scale. And so our commitment to our people is really, really key in this environment and has really helped us hire retain top talent and will continue to do that. It's not a one and done.  In terms of the broader question on M&A, I think you said it right. For us we've taken a very, very different path to crafting a CRM solution. And in times like this, in times, almost many time, it is a real value proposition that resonates within our segment of customers. Our customers don't want to spend a ton of time, ton of money, ton of resources, ton of IT, to be able to hobble things together. And so our crafted experience and platform has resonated and continues to resonate. So when we think about M&A, we'll certainly look at it and \u2013 but we want to maintain and enhance the customer experience. And when we do look at M&A, it'll be more from the perspective of accelerating one of our primary colors, which is within our HubSpot framework or maybe adding a new primary color and so continue to look at it. But the crafted experience is something that we really deeply care about and believe in. Yes. A great question. Good, top of mind question in terms of pricing and you're absolutely right. We did change the service hub pricing from 400 per month to 500 per month based on all of the features and functionality that we just re-launch. And I'd say, look, I think, we are going to stay consistent with our pricing and packaging philosophy. And our pricing philosophy is that we add value to customers. And when we know we have added value and when our customers have received a tremendous amount of value, then we look at pricing changes, and that's exactly what we did with the service hub pricing increase that you just mentioned. And the other part of our overall packaging strategy is that we'll continue to pour innovation. We want to build just exceptionally powerful features on the enterprise tier, and we want to keep bringing down those features, high-end features into starter and professional addition so that our customers can get the value from all the innovation that we are doing. And that's our consistent pricing and packaging strategy will remain focused to that strategy. And when we deliver value to customers is then we will make changes to pricing. Yes, thanks a lot for the question. The partner ecosystem has contributed about 40% of our overall ARR, and that continues to be the case. So very strong synergies there. And as we have really transformed from being a marketing automation company to a CRM platform, and as we have transformed from really being a small business company to a mid-market company, which is both of these are pretty big transformations. We've really enrolled our partner ecosystem in that transformation. And we have enabled them to come along with us and we've made a ton of investment. So overall our strategy that we have clearly communicated to the partner ecosystem is we want to scale selling and servicing with that partner ecosystem. And I think it's going really well. I talk to partners a lot and I know some of you do as well. And what I hear from that is that the CRM platform scaling is going well. Our customers definitely clearly see the need for a platform and our partners are able to help. When our partners get engaged with customers, customer dollar retention, improves revenue retention improves, and the multi-hub adoption improves. And so it's a win for customers. It's a win for partners and therefore it's a win for HubSpot. So I'm pretty excited about how the partner ecosystem is coming along with us. Well, I want to finish off by thanking all of our customers, our partners, employees, as well as the investors. Thank you so much for your support. We really appreciate it. HubSpot appreciates it. And we look forward to talking to you again next quarter."

Now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to HubSpot's Chief Executive Officer, Yamini Rangan. Yamini?\nYamini Rangan: Thank you, Ryan and welcome to everyone joining us today. Let me start with our Q4 and 2023 results, share my observations on the macro environment as we step into a new year and wrap up with our strategy for balancing growth, efficiency and culture in 2024. We saw a solid finish to a good year despite the challenging macro environment. Q4 revenue grew 21% year-over-year in constant currency and full year 2023 revenue grew 25% in constant currency. We delivered a standout operating profit margin of 17% in Q4 and 15% for the full year, up over 500 basis points year-over-year. Total customers grew 23% to over 205,000 customers globally, driven by nearly 11,000 net customer additions in the quarter, a new record for us. Our customers have high confidence in our ability to help them grow and we are becoming the clear platform of choice for scaling companies. Our momentum in Q4 and 2023 results highlight two important aspects of our strategy that are working. First, we're focused on crafting great products and continuously innovating to solve for the customer and second, we are consistently driving go-to-market execution across digital, sales and partner channels. At the lower end of the market, we saw exceptionally strong net adds driven by Starter momentum. Our pricing optimization plays continue to work. Our value proposition of an easy-to-buy, easy-to-use platform is crystal clear and our efforts to amplify this value in-app, in-chat and across brand campaigns drove results in the quarter. We improved our in-app, onboarding and support to help customers get value faster and our investments to drive retention are beginning to work. These efforts resulted in record net adds that we are pleased with. In upmarket the big themes in Q4 were large deal strength, sales hub and multi-hub momentum. We saw seasonally strong impact from large deals as more upmarket customers are consolidating on our platform. 60% of Pro and Enterprise customers are now on two or more hubs and more customers are starting with multi-hub. Post the relaunch at INBOUND sales hub is just cranking. Customers are getting value from AI-Powered features like call summarization and forecasting and are driving sales productivity with the new prospecting workspace. We can see from the results that doubling down here was the right choice. Sales Hub was our fastest growing hub in the quarter in terms of new business with 18 of the top 25 wins including Sales Hub. It is becoming a sustainable front door to HubSpot and I'm thrilled with the momentum we are seeing after the relaunch. Overall, 2023 was a banner year for product innovation with over 800 product enhancements across our hubs and entire platform. We want to be the market share leader in marketing, sales and service for scaling companies and we doubled down on core hubs to deliver even more value to customers. In addition to relaunching Sales Hub, we enhanced Marketing Hub with more omni-channel features like Instagram reels and introduced more robust insights with customer journey analytics. With Service Hub, we introduced multiple knowledge bases, which was a top customer request and advanced our vision of a modern helpdesk. And of course, the big headline in 2023 was the launch of HubSpot AI. We were early with Gen AI beta launches and have embedded AI features across our entire platform and hubs so customers can get the power of AI without needing to become AI experts. Reflecting on 2023, we moved fast with AI to drive innovation for our customers. We doubled down on core hubs to further establish ourselves as the platform of choice for scaling companies and we focused on consistent execution of our bimodal strategy. I'm thrilled with the innovation the team delivered in 2023 and look forward to driving even more value for our customers this year. Okay, I want to quickly touch on what we're seeing in the macro environment. Throughout 2023, we saw customers tightening their budgets, deal cycles taking longer and overall scrutiny in the buying process. Though these trends continued in Q4, we saw some buyer urgency at the end of the year, driving sequential improvement in large deals. Customers are simplifying and consolidating on fewer, more effective platforms, and this translated to stable gross retention and more multi-hub wins for HubSpot. That said, we're not sounding the all clear just yet, as we continue to see cautious buying and multiple decision makers involved in deals. Overall, we expect this choppy environment to persist, and we will remain focused on HubSpot's specific growth, drivers and execution in 2024. Shifting gears I want to share context on the pricing change we recently announced and the strategic rationale behind it. As we have evolved from an app to suite to customer platform, we've had a simple strategy, make HubSpot easy-to-use and easy-to-buy. We're doubling down on the strategy to make HubSpot even easier to buy. That's why we announced a new seat space pricing model on January 30 that will go into effect for all new customers on March 5. For existing customers, pricing will remain the same at the time of the migration, but they will see a price increase of 5% or less at the time of their next renewal. Now, there are three reasons for this shift. First, we want to make it even easier for customers to get started with HubSpot, and therefore we're removing seat minimums for Sales Hub and Service Hub. This will remove friction for customers and will help us accelerate market share gains. Second, we want to make it easier for customers to upgrade from Starter. We have heard feedback that the price jump from Starter to Pro or Enterprise is high. This is a point of friction as customers look to upgrade. So we're changing the Pro and Enterprise seat pricing for Sales Hub and Service Hub and we are introducing view only seats, core seats for users who want to edit, and specialized seats for users who need specific functionality like sales or service. This change will bridge the gap between Starter and Pro, and drive more Pro plus adoption and upgrades. Third, and perhaps most importantly, we're aligning price to the value from our AI-Powered smart CRM. We've invested heavily in our smart CRM over the past few years to make it more customizable, extensible and easier to integrate with. The easiest way for you to think about smart CRM is it's the unified customer record, which enables our customers to have a single view of their customers. Now, customers can continue to view the CRM for free, but will need a core seat to edit it. This expands our ability to monetize beyond core personas to ops, admin finance personas who may need more powerful edit capabilities. In addition, we have embedded HubSpot AI across our entire platform and hubs, which means that customers at every tier can access AI features at no additional cost. This differentiated strategy should drive even more adoption of HubSpot AI and drive more upgrades as we continue to add value in higher tiers. We launched the seats pricing changes as a pilot in ANZ in April 2023 and we have fine-tuned our execution based on customer, partner and sales feedback. For the global launch in March we are hyper focused on enabling our teams and partners to communicate the value of the changes to customers. Overall, I'm really excited about our pricing model evolution. It's going to make HubSpot easier to buy and easier to scale as our product grows, while matching how we monetize the platform based on the value we deliver to customers. Okay, I want to wrap up by sharing our strategy for 2024 and how we are balancing growth, profitability and culture to drive durable growth. Our strategy is working and we have high conviction in our strategic choices. We remain focused on SMBs, a very large growing and underserved market, and we are well positioned to innovate and be a leader in this market. The way we differentiate is by making our products easy to buy, easy to adopt and easy to use. In 2024, we will double down on our playbook of driving the pace of product innovation, focusing on consistent execution and building a high performing, sustainable company. On the product side, you can expect to see us take big swings in AI, build deeper and more sophisticated upmarket functionality, and focus on driving product usage across all hubs and platforms. AI in 2023 was all about speed and being fast to market. 2024 is going to be all about delivering value. We are doubling down on HubSpot AI use cases that are driving repeat usage and will innovate even more with AI agents. With our core hubs, we will continue to go deep on the key use cases our customers need across marketing, sales and service, and bring more upmarket sophistication to Sales Hub and Service Hub specifically.\nGo-to-Market: As we look forward this year, we have momentum in a large market. Our pricing evolution will allow us to accelerate acquiring and serving more customers, and the pace of product innovation will enable us to become the number one AI-Powered customer platform for scaling companies. With that, I'll hand it over to our CFO, Kate Bueker to take you through our financial and operating results.\nSelf: As we look forward this year, we have momentum in a large market.

Let's turn to our fourth quarter and full year 2023 financial results. Q4 revenue grew 21% year-over-year in constant currency and 24% on an as reported basis. Q4 subscription revenue grew 24% year-over-year, while services and other revenue increased 2% on an as reported basis. Full year 2023 revenue grew 25% year-over-year in both constant currency and as reported. Full year subscription revenue grew 26% year-over-year, while services and other revenue increased 16%, both on an as reported basis. Q4 domestic revenue grew 17% year-over-year. International revenue growth was 27% in constant currency and 32% as reported now representing 48% of total revenue. Clearbit revenue was de minimis in Q4. We added nearly 11,000 net new customers in the quarter, bringing our total customer count to over 205,000, growing 23% year over year and surpassing a notable milestone of 200,000 customers. This strength was once again driven by a significant volume of customer additions at the low end. Average subscription revenue per customer was nearly $11,400, growing 1% on an as reported basis and declining 1% year-over-year in constant currency. Our strong growth in our lower ASP Starter customers more than offset the positive impact to ASRPC of the steady progress in our multi-hub adoption upmarket. Our customer count and ASRPC metrics exclude the impact of the Clearbit acquisition in Q4. Gross retention held steady in the high 80s in Q4 and net revenue retention was comfortably above 100 and flat sequentially. We continue to see customers actively scrutinize spending, resulting in continued pressure on net upgrades. We expect similar trends to continue in the short-term, with net revenue retention likely staying in and around the current range in 2024. Calculated billings were $662 million in Q4, growing 21% year-over-year in constant currency, and 22% as reported, driven by our strong large deal performance in Q4. This includes roughly 0.5 point of contribution from the Clearbit acquisition. The remainder of my comments will refer to non-GAAP measures. Q4 operating margin was 17% and full year operating margin was 15%, both up significantly compared to the year ago period. Our Q4 and 2023 operating margin increase was driven by our workforce reduction in Q1, product infrastructure optimization, the impact of the changes in our partner commission structure and prudent and focused hiring throughout the year. Net income was $92 million in Q4 or $1.76 per fully diluted share. Free cash flow was $83 million in Q4 or 14% of revenue, and $292 million or 13% of revenue for the full year. Finally, our cash and marketable securities totaled $1.7 billion at the end of December. Before we jump into guidance, I wanted to share some perspective on our expectations for the macro environment and provide some detail regarding the impact of the Clearbit acquisition and our pricing change on growth and KPIs for 2024. As Yamini shared, we continue to operate in a choppy and challenging environment. Despite some signs of stabilization in downgrades and buyer urgency in Q4, our current working assumption is that the macroeconomic environment will remain challenging in 2024. The introduction of our seats based pricing model is an important foundational change to make it easier for prospects and customers to get started and grow with HubSpot. Our first motion will be focused on selling to new customers in this model and we expect less than a point of contribution to revenue growth in 2024 from this change. Over the longer term, we expect this to be a more material driver to the business as new customers grow in this model and we introduce the change to our existing customers. We believe that our continued success at the low end coupled with the lower barrier to entry and our new pricing model will allow us to maintain quarterly net customer additions around 10,000 in 2024. This will result in ASRPC growth that is down in the low single digits for the year. Finally, we officially closed the acquisition of Clearbit in December. In terms of 2024 contribution, we expect the acquisition to drive roughly a point of growth to revenue. Now, let's turn to our guidance for the first quarter and full year of 2024. For the first quarter total as reported revenue is expected to be in the range of $596 million to $598 million, up 19% year-over-year at the midpoint. Non-GAAP operating profit is expected to be between $83 million and $84 million. Non-GAAP diluted net income per share is expected to be between $1.48 and $1.50. This assumes 53.1 million fully diluted shares outstanding. And for the full year of 2024 total as reported revenue is expected to be in the range of $2.55 billion to $2.56 billion, up 18% year-over-year at the midpoint. Non-GAAP operating profit is expected to be between $408 million and $412 million. Non-GAAP diluted net income per share is expected to be between $6.86 and $6.94. This assumes 53.6 million fully diluted shares outstanding. As you adjust your models, please keep in mind the following. We expect foreign exchange to have a neutral impact on both our Q1 and full year 2024 as reported revenue growth. The impact of our pricing change and the Clearbit acquisition is included in our guidance. We expect Non-GAAP operating profit margins to be approximately 14% in the first and second quarters and the mid to high teams in the back half of the year. We expect CapEx as a percentage of revenue to be roughly 4% and free cash flow to be about $365 million for the full year of 2024, with seasonally stronger free cash flow in Q1 and Q4. And with that, I will hand things back over to Yamini for her closing remarks.\nYamini Rangan: Thanks so much Kate. I want to close by highlighting our momentum in becoming the customer platform of choice for scaling companies. G2 recently released their annual Best Software Awards and HubSpot was recognized as the number one sales product and the number one marketing product in 2024. This recognition is a strong testament to the pace of innovation we are driving and our focus on delivering value. My huge, heartfelt thank you to our employees who work tirelessly to solve for our customers, and a big thank you to our partners, customers and shareholders for the continued support. With that operator, let's please open up the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question is from the line of Samad Samano with Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nSamad Samano: Hi, thanks for taking my question. Congrats on a strong finish to 2023. So Yamini, you gave a lot of information about the pricing model change and it was helpful. I want to maybe dig a little deeper there. It looks like the impact to customers will be minimal and it encourages them to try more of HubSpot, but how do you expect this to impact? I know you gave the net adds number, but what about the potential doors that customers enter through? Do you see maybe a shift from marketing, maybe more towards sales or service? Is that part of the intention here? And whether it makes up more consistent with some of your enterprise competitors as far as their pricing is structured, just especially as you gain more traction with mid-market customers? And then Kate, I know you baked into the guidance, but can you just give us timing wise, is it more back half that you expect the impact to guidance from the pricing model change? Thank you both so much and congrats on a great quarter.\nYamini Rangan: Hey Samad, thanks a lot. Maybe to address multiple questions that you asked there, we have always been easy-to-buy and easy-to-use and we are just doubling down to make HubSpot even easier to buy. This change has been probably a couple of years in the making, and we got started with these changes by talking to our customers, to hear from them in terms of where they experience points of friction in the buying journey and where they're seeing value. That's how we got started. And I talked about the three shifts and it's easy to see how this all adds up. The first shift is, we want it to be super easy for customers to get started with HubSpot, so we're removing the seat minimum. What we have seen in the pilot and what we expect in terms of this change is it will result in more customers starting with HubSpot and higher volume of Starter customers over a period of time. The second thing we did is we reduced the price jump between Starter and Pro. And you've asked us this before. Our customers have consistently given us the feedback that the jump from Starter to Pro is really high and that's a point of friction for our customers. By lowering the price per seat for Pro and Enterprise, it reduces that friction. And again, we're seeing that in making this change, there are more customers that start with Starter and then continue to upgrade into Pro and Enterprise, which is exactly what we want in order to have a great foundation for pricing. And the third, and probably most importantly, we're now monetizing the value of smart CRM. We've invested pretty heavily in smart CRM over the past few years. We've made it customizable, we've made it extensible, we've made it easier to integrate with, and this change allows us to monetize. You asked specifically about how does this compare to the rest and what are we beginning to see? I think you're going to see more volume, because we have removed the friction, both in terms of Starter and Pro, and then over a period of time the biggest opportunity is really post sales expansion and growth. When we sign more customers, then reps have the capacity to go back and sell more in terms of cross sell opportunities. When customers start with exactly what they need, then they now will buy more seats as they continue to expand and core seats is a new upgrade lever. So this is a foundational shift that removes friction and provides value and gives us the ability to continue to expand over the next multiple years. So we're really excited about this change.\nKate Bueker: Yes. And Samad, I think the impact in the year flows very naturally from what Yamini said. We're going to have more customers starting at lower ASP, but growing more over time and so you'd naturally see that build more into the back half of the year.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. Next question is from the line of Parker Lane with Stifel. Your line is now open.\nParker Lane: Hey team, thanks for taking the question. Yamini, I wanted to just sort of stay on that theme we were talking about here with the pricing and packaging changes. And when we look at the specialized in view only seat types, have you guys done work to figure out how many of the potential seats that have not been addressed in the past can now be addressed under this package? Not just the new customer acquisition side, but actually on the expansion side in those two areas.\nYamini Rangan: Yeah, so maybe just to address the basics, so we now have three seat types. The first is just a view only seat. If anybody within the whole company wants to view it, that's the seat view. The second type of seat, and this is probably the new change that we are introducing, is in core seat and this is really associated with the smart CRM. And then the third is the specialized seat if you need a Sales Hub specialized functionality or Service Hub specialized functionality. To take a moment and maybe talk about the biggest change, which is that core seat, we talked about smart CRM at INBOUND and the easiest way to think about smart CRM is it's a core system of customer records. If you want contact information, you want company information, if you want information on the interactions in your customer, all of that is associated with that smart CRM layer. And over the past few years, as we look at where customers are spending the most time and getting value, they will tell you that it is from having a single unified view of the customer. And what we have done with this pricing model change is if you want to view it, you can use the free seat, but if you want to edit anything within that core CRM, you will need to buy a core seat. So by monetizing that smart CRM, we're aligning the value where customers are getting to our monetization strategy, and it really goes back to our core pricing philosophy. We add value, and then when we know we have added a ton of value, then we align the monetization.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. Next question is from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nMark Murphy: Thank you so much. Yamini, you stated that AI will be embedded across the entire platform and that customers can access it at no additional cost. So I'm curious, how might you handle a high octane user or a campaign which might incur a lot of LLM cost on the back end. So just in other words, should we look at this and say, well, it's a less than 5% price increase and then it's free AI for everyone or are you going to have other tokens or credits or SKUs, something like that for some of the higher AI usage scenarios?\nYamini Rangan: Yes, that's a great question Mark. I want to say that our AI is embedded. It is not free, and there is a difference between those two. And maybe just step back, this is very, very consistent with what we communicated as our AI monetization strategy at Analyst Day. It's very, very early stages on a very massive shift in the industry, and we are focused on driving value and making it super easy for scaling companies to just adopt AI. That's why we've taken this strategy and we've embedded AI into platform and all of the hubs, and by including the AI into our platform and hubs, we're just driving acquisition of customers. That's number one. The second thing which is important to note is that while all of our tiers, Premium, Starter, Pro and Enterprise have AI features, we have a lot more features at the pro and enterprise tiers. And in fact, 65% of the features that are becoming generally available in the first half of 2024 will be in the Pro Plus tier. So the way we think about it is that it'll drive a lot of upgrades and higher ASP in terms of tier upgrades. And then longer term, when we drive even more sophisticated features like AI agents, then we may charge specifically for it. So going back to kind of your question on how do you make sure that in its scale right now we think we're in the early stages removing friction, educating customers, driving adoption, making sure there's repeat usage, that's the focus. And based on what we're seeing, we're not quite worried about the cost impact, but if we continue to introduce very sophisticated features where it has an impact, then we will charge for it. So that's how we're thinking about monetizing.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. The next question is from the line of Elizabeth Elliott with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nElizabeth Elliott: Great, thank you very much. So your bimodal strategy has really enabled you to add a lot of that low end customers in 2023 and especially exiting the year. So I wanted to get a better sense of how quickly do customers typically upgrade. It sounds like the price narrowing that price jump should be a bit of an accelerator, but just curious on when we could see the big upgrade opportunity and have that start to benefit ASRPC growth. Thank you.\nKate Bueker: Yes. Thanks Elizabeth for the question. We are again pleased with the strength that we saw in our Starter customer additions in the quarter. There are both strategic and financial reasons that we want to continue to lean into low end customer acquisition. We think that the sort of significant volume of customers we have at the low end provides us with a nice competitive moat. It also makes our overall ecosystem more valuable, so both of those are strategic reasons. Starter upgrades, if you sort of look at the impact that they've had for us, represent probably a couple of points of net revenue retention for us. And we continue to see pretty healthy rates of upgrades from starter cohorts. About half of that happens within the first six months. There is still friction in that motion. Yamini talked about the meaningful jump that we have in price between Starter and Professional, so the dollars of upgrade from starter and professional are relatively small. That said, we think this seats pricing model should reduce the overall friction in that motion and we're optimistic that we can really change the game on the Starter upgrade rate with this new pricing model.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. Next question is from the line of Rishi Jaluria with RBC. Your line is now open.\nRishi Jaluria: Oh wonderful. Thanks so much for taking my questions. Nice to see continued momentum in the business. I wanted to drill a little bit more into the AI strategy. Obviously you have really impressive innovation we've seen on AI, especially when we think about how you're innovating compared to some of your CRM competitors. I'd love to hear maybe number one, what sort of feedback have you had from customers in terms of new use cases that maybe you hadn't initially thought about? And second, and maybe more importantly, has this started turning up as part of initial sales conversations and maybe a consideration that new customers are having when it comes to choosing you versus others? Thank you.\nYamini Rangan: Thank you, Rishi for that question. Maybe the way I'd characterize it was 2023. 2023 was a year of experimentation and this year is going to be all about delivering customer value. And probably the most important leading indicator that we are looking for is repeat usage of AI features. So the focus for the product team, the focus for the go to market team is really one, educating customers and two, making sure that any feature that we have out is driving repeat usage. That's the focus. You asked about, what are we learning? We're definitely seeing a lot of adoption, but there is some signal, some noise. And as I look at our top maybe 20 customers who are leveraging AI effectively, there are a few key trends. The first one is prospecting and company research is really, really a big use case and ChatSpot is driving that. We have over 200,000 cumulative users on ChatSpot and more than 20,000 monthly active users, and they're just wanting to use AI for better researching companies, better preparation before they talk to customers and that's great. Marketing, not a surprise at all, but the use cases and marketing that we started with the launch of content assistance last year is now getting well integrated into the flow of work. So marketers using generative AI for creating blogs, creating emails, creating titles, taking one content, and then modifying that content into multiple channels, that is becoming very common and we are seeing those use cases get into the daily action. The third and probably not a surprise again, is Service Hub. Our highest usage in terms of features is summarizing conversations and then generating takeaways that feature, and specifically, there's something called highlight command, and we're very surprised by this, but being able to highlight a particular text and then change the tone, change the, expand the text, that is getting almost daily usage. And so, I think we're seeing areas where it is deeply integrated into the flow of work and we're beginning to see much more usage. And we have a very robust roadmap of AI features that's coming up. A lot of those features are in kind of the Pro Plus categories, and I'm really excited to see the usage metrics go up. So a lot of the work that we're going to be doing this year is looking for those usage patterns.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. Next question is from the line of Keith Bachman with BMO. Your line is now open.\nKeith Bachman: Yes, many thanks. First, Kate, for you, I wanted to see if you could talk about how we should be thinking about billings growth versus the revenue growth for 2024. There was actually convergence in the December quarter, which was a bit sooner than we were thinking. And so if you could just at least directionally or provide some philosophical points of view about how we should be thinking about the variance, or lack thereof, between the revenue growth guidance that you've given and what we should be thinking about billings? And then, Yamini, just for you, if I could sneak another in, I wanted to see if you could revisit on existing customers as it relates to the price change. We've gone through the information in detail, and you mentioned that those customers would see a 5% price bump at the time of renewal. But do they make a transition at the time of the renewal to the new price plan or they can continue on, and that's where the 5% bump happens?\nKate Bueker: Maybe I'll start. Thanks, Keith. You are right on the constant currency billings and constant currency revenue growth in Q4 were both 21%. There's a couple of things that helped close the gap between billings and revenue versus what we have seen over the last couple of quarters. The first is that we and you heard Yamini talk about this in her prepared remarks. This was a good quarter for us in terms of big deals, and big deals tend to have longer billing terms, and so it showed up in billings for us in Q4. The other thing that's notable is December was particularly strong for us. And so from a timing perspective, it helps to drive the closure between billings and revenue. In terms of 2024, we expect that billings growth and revenue growth, again, both in constant currency will actually track pretty close to one another, plus or minus a percent or so from one quarter to the next.\nYamini Rangan: And Keith, on your question in terms of impact of the pricing changes for existing customers, we are being very thoughtful in how we roll this out to our existing customers and couple of maybe first principles as we do this. One, we don't want the customer experience as they go from one pricing model to another to even be noticeable. That's one principle. The second is we don't want any surprises for existing customers as they kind of go through this pricing change. So as I mentioned in March, what we're launching is only for new customers. The migration for existing customers to the new model, which means having view only seats, having core seats, and having specialized seats, that migration will begin mid-2024 and it will go through 2025 in waves. So that again, the experience for customers is seamless. They probably won't even notice that they have been migrated on the back end to support the new deep model. Then at the first renewal after migration, customers can expect up to 5% increase, no more than 5% increase, and that way they have visibility in terms of the level of change that they can expect. We've started doing this as part of our ANZ pilot and we're finding that it's a very seamless kind of motion for existing customers with plenty of time for them to adjust to kind of the new motion.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. Next question is from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.\nKirk Materne: Yes, thanks very much and I'll echo the congrats on the quarter. Yamini, I just wonder if you just talk a little about the strength in international versus the U.S., meaning, are the trends there either in the high end of the market or the low end of the market any different? Obviously really good growth out of that segment, so why don't you just unpack that a little bit more? Thanks so much.\nYamini Rangan: Yes. Overall, the strength just is consistent across international and North America. We talked about the bigger trends that we saw in Q4, which is large yield momentum, Sales Hub momentum, multi-hub momentum. We kind of saw the same trends in North America as we saw within the international markets and very consistent with prior quarters.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. Next question is from the line of Ken Wong with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.\nKenneth Wong: Great. Thank you for taking my question, I wanted to maybe dive in on the strength in sort of down marketing Q4, usually that's more of an enterprise quarter, which you guys did emphasize seeing some strength. Did you guys run any unique plays to try to spark some of that demand in the long tail, or did that catch you guys by surprise as well?\nKate Bueker: Yes. Ken it\u2019s Kate, I'll start. Look, the success that we saw in the net additions at the low end in Q4 was very much consistent in terms of the themes as we've been talking about over the last couple of quarters here. It's very Starter focused. We continue to see strong top of funnel demand. Frankly, the value proposition of our starter product is just really compelling. We constantly run experiments. There is nothing different in Q4 that I would note versus sort of our normal course. We continue to experiment with pricing and packaging, and we continue to experiment in ways to reduce friction in the motion of a free user becoming a Starter customer.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. Next question is from the line of Tyler Radke with Citigroup. Your line is now open.\nTyler Radke: Yes, thanks for taking the question. Wanted to hit on Clearbit, which sounded like there was a modest contribution in Q4, but you are expecting that to ramp up to a point of growth next year. Can you just talk about now that you've had a few months post the announcement, kind of what your plans are from a roadmap perspective, how you're thinking about pricing and then what kind of the range bound is on that one points, what's a scenario that could potentially drive upside to that? Thank you.\nKate Bueker: Yes, I could start with the first part on the strategy and the vision. First of all, we're very pleased with successfully closing in December. We welcomed all of the Clearbit employees into HubSpot family early January, and everyone's kind of excited to build something special. We do think that Clearbit can accelerate our vision of the customer platform. And if you take a step back, we want to be able to bring together enriched data, powerful AI tools that can drive insights from the data and are easy to use engagement hubs so that our customers can connect and grow. This is really driving and accelerating our vision for providing a customer platform. And we continue to get really good positive feedback from customers and partners. They can see this vision come to life in terms of how we're thinking about Clearbit, a couple of different phases. Initially, we will look to get Clearbit data into our customer base. Our customers want more enriched data and intent data. They want it that is completely unified within the hubs and the platform. And Clearbit has already been within our marketplace. There's a clear integration. And so it's a natural starting point for cross selling into our install base. And that motion has started, probably in the medium term as we do with any of the acquisitions. We want to more natively integrate the data into HubSpot products and so that we can really fire up all of the use cases and marketing, sales and our entire customer platform and we're starting with that journey and we'll also be able to talk fully leverage all of our distribution to be able to take that native product to market. And so it'll happen in a couple of phases, but we are really excited about what this does for our vision as well as how the initial few weeks have gone by.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. Next question is from the line of Brad Sills with Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nBradley Sills: Oh great. Thank you so much. I wanted to ask a question on just the model here and growth drivers here between customer count and ASRPC. Obviously, we're at a point now where the growth is really outsized towards customer count. Could we see a more balanced dispersion between customer count and ASRPC over time? What would be the keys to get back to that? Is this a macro phenomenon where you're seeing that strength in starter addition? And as we get into potentially a better macro, you just see more of a balanced growth there and then just one follow-up. I think it'd be helpful to clarify if there was any material contribution to Q4 deferred from Clearbit. Thank you so much.\nKate Bueker: Yes, maybe I'll just start with the last one, because it's a super straightforward. There was a very little amount of impact to the deferred revenue from Clearbit. The way that it's measured and reported is just the change from December until year end. So it was very small in terms of the net Ads and ASRPC. I would just say, Brad, over the time that I've been here, we have consistently gone through waves where we see outsized growth on net customer additions, followed by periods where we see outsized growth in the expansion of existing customers. I think we're at a point here where there's a lot of things happening, particularly with the seats model change, that are going to fuel a short-term focus on growth in that net adds number. But if you think about the way that Yamini talked about the impacts of that seats model over time that will drive an expansion motion that can become a tailwind to ASRPC.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. Next question is from the line of Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Ryan on for Alex. Just had a quick question on the potential uplift from the monetization opportunity of core seats from the CRM module, or just kind of put another way for a typical customer. Now that you're monetizing that and you weren't know what's the kind of uplift to a typical contract from that specifically? Thanks.\nKate Bueker: Yes, I think it's important to understand that this impact will happen for new customers only through largely 2024 and that after the migration we start to see renewals. You will see some similar growth trends out of the install base. The addition of the core seat, as you heard from Yamini, is really our ability or opportunity to monetize the CRM. And in our model, every active user on the platform will need to have a paid seat. The data points that we have are really from the pilot and what we saw in the pilot was very strong assignment of core seats across the set of customers on the new model, which indicates to us that there is real value here and we should see a meaningful uplift in the percentage of users who will be on a paid seat.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. Next question is from the line of Brian Peterson with Raymond James. Your line is now open.\nBrian Peterson: Hi. And also my congrats on the strong results. So we've heard from some of your partners that Service Hub was stronger this quarter. I know you mentioned that the multiproduct deals and Sales Hub increasingly being a front door, but is Service Hub maybe another potential front door that you guys can walk through? And has that created any more prospects or TAM on the B2C side? We'd love to get your thoughts there. Thanks guys.\nYamini Rangan: Yes, that's a great question. We are definitely pleased with the momentum in Service Hub, both from a product perspective as well as customer adoption perspective. As you know, last year was a pretty big year for Service Hub Pro. We did a ton of work to make the pro tier very, very powerful and we also added some differentiating features on the enterprise tiers. And based on the work that the team did, we saw a lot more adoption upmarket. When we talk about multi-hub wins, there are more customers now, starting with two, three hubs. And when we see that the power of having all of your customer information in one platform and therefore including Service Hub there has become pattern. So we're very, very happy about that. I think we're not done yet. I think there's just a tremendous amount of work that we're going to be doing in the Service Hub area this year to make it even more competitive. AI is a pretty big lever in terms of Service Hub, the kinds of use cases that we're seeing and attraction of use cases that we're seeing. I talked about summarizing conversations, highlighting commands for content generation, and editing answers. All of that is driving a lot more effectiveness within our Service Hub customers and also driving engagement. So we're very excited about the trajectory. Now, stepping back, we have a playbook with Sales Hub and you can see it's working. When we focus the product organization, when we align the go to market teams, we know how to get that to a front door. I think we can apply the same kind of playbook for Service Hub. It will get into the same trajectory as Sales Hub as we continue to innovate for our customers.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. The next question is from the line of Terry Tillman with Truist. Your line is now open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. Thanks so much for taking the question. This is Bobby Dion for Terry, curious to get an update on the health and strength of partner channels. Are you seeing more partners adept at doing platform selling versus single hub specializations? Thanks and congratulations.\nYamini Rangan: Yes, thank you so much. The partner momentum continues to grow I just spent a bunch of time with partners this week and we're all doing the kickoffs ready for 2024 and there continues to be good momentum and excitement within the partner channel. As you know, partners contribute to about 40% of our ARR and that has continued to grow as we have scaled maybe to step back. We have a very, very clear strategy with partners. We've gone to our partners and we said we want to scale selling, co-selling and servicing with you and we want you to become experts of the entire customer platform. And this journey is something that has been on the making for the past three years and partners have enrolled in that journey. More partners are now well versed in overall CRM, the entire customer platform. They know the value proposition of multiple hubs. They're able to get our customers started with greater onboarding, better engagement and then continue to drive multiple hub adoption. And so I think you're seeing partners gain even more traction with us upmarket and you're seeing partners drive multi-hub momentum as well as larger deals upmarket. And so it's become a really nice growth lever to continue to grow the ecosystem for us.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. Next question is from the line of Arjun Bhatia with William Blair. Your line is now open.\nArjun Bhatia: Perfect. Thank you and I'll add my congrats. Maybe sticking on the pricing changes, I'm curious if when you think about the new customers since that's going to go into effect first, does it actually change the incentive structures for new customers to buy the suite more or do you anticipate there could be more single product adoption from new customers as a landing point going forward and then eventually growing into multi-hub customers over time?\nKate Bueker: Yes, maybe. The way I would think about it is that in the lower end of the market and when customers are thinking about Starter absolutely removes all friction. We've always had a great momentum in Starter. Now that we've removed the seat minimums, it encourages starter customers to start with the suite and I'd say that the value proposition is exceptionally compelling. There is almost nothing out there with the value that we provide for the price per seed and it has become such a compelling starting point and it is all sweet at the lower end and the lower tier. Now upmarket, I don't think necessarily this pricing change is going to make everybody think about suite, and that's really not the motion. What we want people to do is to start with a couple of hubs and then continue to drive adoption and then continue to get value over a period of time. What it does is it removes that friction point for the upgrade. So when we get a lot more customers, the Starter tier, when we remove the friction, then more folks are going to go into the Pro tier and the Enterprise tier. And over a period of time, this sets up the foundation for accelerating customer acquisition and then continuing to show the value for those customers so that they continue to go upmarket with us and so that's probably the way to think about it.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. The next question is from the line of David Hynes with Canaccord Genuity. Your line is now open.\nDavid Hynes: Hey, thanks guys. Yamini, can we just go back to the large deal activity? I think you characterized it as urgency, which is a term we haven't heard much of in software lately. Can you talk about does it feel like there's a sign maybe at the high end of your customer base? Was it just a year end phenomenon? Has there been any durability in those trends? Any color of what you're seeing on the large deal front would be interesting.\nYamini Rangan: Yes, I know. Urgency is definitely not something that we have heard in the past few quarters and so we definitely saw it towards the end of the quarter, especially with larger deals and multi-hub wins. In upmarket, we saw customers wanting to consolidate into fewer effective platforms, both to reduce the total cost of ownership as well as to get better visibility across sales and marketing as they set up for the new year. So a lot of the conversations that we had towards the end of the quarter were, how do we consolidate, how do we get better visibility so we can set up a growth in 2024? I do think that our fast time to value, easy to adopt but very powerful tools is just compelling, and we saw that towards the end of the year. I think, like I said earlier in the prepared remarks, it doesn't mean that the whole environment has shifted. We are really not ready to call it all clear in terms of the patterns, but the value proposition upmarket is certainly resonating and that translated into large deal strength.\nRyan Burkart: Operator, I think we have time for maybe one more question.\nOperator: The final question is from the line of Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\nMichael Turrin: Hey, great, thanks. I appreciate you squeezing me in. A nice job. At the close of the year, I was hoping you could maybe compare and contrast what you saw across customer segments exiting the year. It's pretty clear from the comments throughout that the starter motion has come through strong, but I was hoping we could maybe revisit the macro commentary you made across segments. And then in terms of guidance, what you're assuming sounded like macro does not improve in the current scenario, but just going back to that as a closing point I think is helpful? Thank you.\nKate Bueker: Yes, I mean, you definitely heard both Yamini and I talk in our prepared remarks that we saw some early positive signs in Q4, but at the highest level, we're assuming that the macro conditions remain challenging into 2024. In general, our customers are still cautious, and we assume that our customers are going to continue to optimize their spend throughout 2024. That said, I do feel like we have seen some stabilization in customer trends. I believe we have a tighter handle on the overall environment and customer behavior entering 2024. So our overarching philosophy for guidance hasn't changed. We always endeavor to set a financial guidance that we feel we have high confidence in achieving.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. There are no additional questions waiting at this time, so I'll pass the conference back to Yamini Rangan, CEO, for any closing remarks.\nYamini Rangan: Well, thank you so much for your support, and we look forward to connecting back again in the quarter.\nOperator: That concludes the conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Kate Bueker",
            "content": "Thanks Yamini. Let's turn to our fourth quarter and full year 2023 financial results. Q4 revenue grew 21% year-over-year in constant currency and 24% on an as reported basis. Q4 subscription revenue grew 24% year-over-year, while services and other revenue increased 2% on an as reported basis. Full year 2023 revenue grew 25% year-over-year in both constant currency and as reported. Full year subscription revenue grew 26% year-over-year, while services and other revenue increased 16%, both on an as reported basis. Q4 domestic revenue grew 17% year-over-year. International revenue growth was 27% in constant currency and 32% as reported now representing 48% of total revenue. Clearbit revenue was de minimis in Q4. We added nearly 11,000 net new customers in the quarter, bringing our total customer count to over 205,000, growing 23% year over year and surpassing a notable milestone of 200,000 customers. This strength was once again driven by a significant volume of customer additions at the low end. Average subscription revenue per customer was nearly $11,400, growing 1% on an as reported basis and declining 1% year-over-year in constant currency. Our strong growth in our lower ASP Starter customers more than offset the positive impact to ASRPC of the steady progress in our multi-hub adoption upmarket. Our customer count and ASRPC metrics exclude the impact of the Clearbit acquisition in Q4. Gross retention held steady in the high 80s in Q4 and net revenue retention was comfortably above 100 and flat sequentially. We continue to see customers actively scrutinize spending, resulting in continued pressure on net upgrades. We expect similar trends to continue in the short-term, with net revenue retention likely staying in and around the current range in 2024. Calculated billings were $662 million in Q4, growing 21% year-over-year in constant currency, and 22% as reported, driven by our strong large deal performance in Q4. This includes roughly 0.5 point of contribution from the Clearbit acquisition. The remainder of my comments will refer to non-GAAP measures. Q4 operating margin was 17% and full year operating margin was 15%, both up significantly compared to the year ago period. Our Q4 and 2023 operating margin increase was driven by our workforce reduction in Q1, product infrastructure optimization, the impact of the changes in our partner commission structure and prudent and focused hiring throughout the year. Net income was $92 million in Q4 or $1.76 per fully diluted share. Free cash flow was $83 million in Q4 or 14% of revenue, and $292 million or 13% of revenue for the full year. Finally, our cash and marketable securities totaled $1.7 billion at the end of December. Before we jump into guidance, I wanted to share some perspective on our expectations for the macro environment and provide some detail regarding the impact of the Clearbit acquisition and our pricing change on growth and KPIs for 2024. As Yamini shared, we continue to operate in a choppy and challenging environment. Despite some signs of stabilization in downgrades and buyer urgency in Q4, our current working assumption is that the macroeconomic environment will remain challenging in 2024. The introduction of our seats based pricing model is an important foundational change to make it easier for prospects and customers to get started and grow with HubSpot. Our first motion will be focused on selling to new customers in this model and we expect less than a point of contribution to revenue growth in 2024 from this change. Over the longer term, we expect this to be a more material driver to the business as new customers grow in this model and we introduce the change to our existing customers. We believe that our continued success at the low end coupled with the lower barrier to entry and our new pricing model will allow us to maintain quarterly net customer additions around 10,000 in 2024. This will result in ASRPC growth that is down in the low single digits for the year. Finally, we officially closed the acquisition of Clearbit in December. In terms of 2024 contribution, we expect the acquisition to drive roughly a point of growth to revenue. Now, let's turn to our guidance for the first quarter and full year of 2024. For the first quarter total as reported revenue is expected to be in the range of $596 million to $598 million, up 19% year-over-year at the midpoint. Non-GAAP operating profit is expected to be between $83 million and $84 million. Non-GAAP diluted net income per share is expected to be between $1.48 and $1.50. This assumes 53.1 million fully diluted shares outstanding. And for the full year of 2024 total as reported revenue is expected to be in the range of $2.55 billion to $2.56 billion, up 18% year-over-year at the midpoint. Non-GAAP operating profit is expected to be between $408 million and $412 million. Non-GAAP diluted net income per share is expected to be between $6.86 and $6.94. This assumes 53.6 million fully diluted shares outstanding. As you adjust your models, please keep in mind the following. We expect foreign exchange to have a neutral impact on both our Q1 and full year 2024 as reported revenue growth. The impact of our pricing change and the Clearbit acquisition is included in our guidance. We expect Non-GAAP operating profit margins to be approximately 14% in the first and second quarters and the mid to high teams in the back half of the year. We expect CapEx as a percentage of revenue to be roughly 4% and free cash flow to be about $365 million for the full year of 2024, with seasonally stronger free cash flow in Q1 and Q4. And with that, I will hand things back over to Yamini for her closing remarks. Yes. And Samad, I think the impact in the year flows very naturally from what Yamini said. We're going to have more customers starting at lower ASP, but growing more over time and so you'd naturally see that build more into the back half of the year. Yes. Thanks Elizabeth for the question. We are again pleased with the strength that we saw in our Starter customer additions in the quarter. There are both strategic and financial reasons that we want to continue to lean into low end customer acquisition. We think that the sort of significant volume of customers we have at the low end provides us with a nice competitive moat. It also makes our overall ecosystem more valuable, so both of those are strategic reasons. Starter upgrades, if you sort of look at the impact that they've had for us, represent probably a couple of points of net revenue retention for us. And we continue to see pretty healthy rates of upgrades from starter cohorts. About half of that happens within the first six months. There is still friction in that motion. Yamini talked about the meaningful jump that we have in price between Starter and Professional, so the dollars of upgrade from starter and professional are relatively small. That said, we think this seats pricing model should reduce the overall friction in that motion and we're optimistic that we can really change the game on the Starter upgrade rate with this new pricing model. Maybe I'll start. Thanks, Keith. You are right on the constant currency billings and constant currency revenue growth in Q4 were both 21%. There's a couple of things that helped close the gap between billings and revenue versus what we have seen over the last couple of quarters. The first is that we and you heard Yamini talk about this in her prepared remarks. This was a good quarter for us in terms of big deals, and big deals tend to have longer billing terms, and so it showed up in billings for us in Q4. The other thing that's notable is December was particularly strong for us. And so from a timing perspective, it helps to drive the closure between billings and revenue. In terms of 2024, we expect that billings growth and revenue growth, again, both in constant currency will actually track pretty close to one another, plus or minus a percent or so from one quarter to the next. Yes. Ken it's Kate, I'll start. Look, the success that we saw in the net additions at the low end in Q4 was very much consistent in terms of the themes as we've been talking about over the last couple of quarters here. It's very Starter focused. We continue to see strong top of funnel demand. Frankly, the value proposition of our starter product is just really compelling. We constantly run experiments. There is nothing different in Q4 that I would note versus sort of our normal course. We continue to experiment with pricing and packaging, and we continue to experiment in ways to reduce friction in the motion of a free user becoming a Starter customer. Yes, I could start with the first part on the strategy and the vision. First of all, we're very pleased with successfully closing in December. We welcomed all of the Clearbit employees into HubSpot family early January, and everyone's kind of excited to build something special. We do think that Clearbit can accelerate our vision of the customer platform. And if you take a step back, we want to be able to bring together enriched data, powerful AI tools that can drive insights from the data and are easy to use engagement hubs so that our customers can connect and grow. This is really driving and accelerating our vision for providing a customer platform. And we continue to get really good positive feedback from customers and partners. They can see this vision come to life in terms of how we're thinking about Clearbit, a couple of different phases. Initially, we will look to get Clearbit data into our customer base. Our customers want more enriched data and intent data. They want it that is completely unified within the hubs and the platform. And Clearbit has already been within our marketplace. There's a clear integration. And so it's a natural starting point for cross selling into our install base. And that motion has started, probably in the medium term as we do with any of the acquisitions. We want to more natively integrate the data into HubSpot products and so that we can really fire up all of the use cases and marketing, sales and our entire customer platform and we're starting with that journey and we'll also be able to talk fully leverage all of our distribution to be able to take that native product to market. And so it'll happen in a couple of phases, but we are really excited about what this does for our vision as well as how the initial few weeks have gone by. Yes, maybe I'll just start with the last one, because it's a super straightforward. There was a very little amount of impact to the deferred revenue from Clearbit. The way that it's measured and reported is just the change from December until year end. So it was very small in terms of the net Ads and ASRPC. I would just say, Brad, over the time that I've been here, we have consistently gone through waves where we see outsized growth on net customer additions, followed by periods where we see outsized growth in the expansion of existing customers. I think we're at a point here where there's a lot of things happening, particularly with the seats model change, that are going to fuel a short-term focus on growth in that net adds number. But if you think about the way that Yamini talked about the impacts of that seats model over time that will drive an expansion motion that can become a tailwind to ASRPC. Yes, I think it's important to understand that this impact will happen for new customers only through largely 2024 and that after the migration we start to see renewals. You will see some similar growth trends out of the install base. The addition of the core seat, as you heard from Yamini, is really our ability or opportunity to monetize the CRM. And in our model, every active user on the platform will need to have a paid seat. The data points that we have are really from the pilot and what we saw in the pilot was very strong assignment of core seats across the set of customers on the new model, which indicates to us that there is real value here and we should see a meaningful uplift in the percentage of users who will be on a paid seat. Yes, maybe. The way I would think about it is that in the lower end of the market and when customers are thinking about Starter absolutely removes all friction. We've always had a great momentum in Starter. Now that we've removed the seat minimums, it encourages starter customers to start with the suite and I'd say that the value proposition is exceptionally compelling. There is almost nothing out there with the value that we provide for the price per seed and it has become such a compelling starting point and it is all sweet at the lower end and the lower tier. Now upmarket, I don't think necessarily this pricing change is going to make everybody think about suite, and that's really not the motion. What we want people to do is to start with a couple of hubs and then continue to drive adoption and then continue to get value over a period of time. What it does is it removes that friction point for the upgrade. So when we get a lot more customers, the Starter tier, when we remove the friction, then more folks are going to go into the Pro tier and the Enterprise tier. And over a period of time, this sets up the foundation for accelerating customer acquisition and then continuing to show the value for those customers so that they continue to go upmarket with us and so that's probably the way to think about it. Yes, I mean, you definitely heard both Yamini and I talk in our prepared remarks that we saw some early positive signs in Q4, but at the highest level, we're assuming that the macro conditions remain challenging into 2024. In general, our customers are still cautious, and we assume that our customers are going to continue to optimize their spend throughout 2024. That said, I do feel like we have seen some stabilization in customer trends. I believe we have a tighter handle on the overall environment and customer behavior entering 2024. So our overarching philosophy for guidance hasn't changed. We always endeavor to set a financial guidance that we feel we have high confidence in achieving."

            "name": "Yamini Rangan",
            "content": "Thank you, Ryan and welcome to everyone joining us today. Let me start with our Q4 and 2023 results, share my observations on the macro environment as we step into a new year and wrap up with our strategy for balancing growth, efficiency and culture in 2024. We saw a solid finish to a good year despite the challenging macro environment. Q4 revenue grew 21% year-over-year in constant currency and full year 2023 revenue grew 25% in constant currency. We delivered a standout operating profit margin of 17% in Q4 and 15% for the full year, up over 500 basis points year-over-year. Total customers grew 23% to over 205,000 customers globally, driven by nearly 11,000 net customer additions in the quarter, a new record for us. Our customers have high confidence in our ability to help them grow and we are becoming the clear platform of choice for scaling companies. Our momentum in Q4 and 2023 results highlight two important aspects of our strategy that are working. First, we're focused on crafting great products and continuously innovating to solve for the customer and second, we are consistently driving go-to-market execution across digital, sales and partner channels. At the lower end of the market, we saw exceptionally strong net adds driven by Starter momentum. Our pricing optimization plays continue to work. Our value proposition of an easy-to-buy, easy-to-use platform is crystal clear and our efforts to amplify this value in-app, in-chat and across brand campaigns drove results in the quarter. We improved our in-app, onboarding and support to help customers get value faster and our investments to drive retention are beginning to work. These efforts resulted in record net adds that we are pleased with. In upmarket the big themes in Q4 were large deal strength, sales hub and multi-hub momentum. We saw seasonally strong impact from large deals as more upmarket customers are consolidating on our platform. 60% of Pro and Enterprise customers are now on two or more hubs and more customers are starting with multi-hub. Post the relaunch at INBOUND sales hub is just cranking. Customers are getting value from AI-Powered features like call summarization and forecasting and are driving sales productivity with the new prospecting workspace. We can see from the results that doubling down here was the right choice. Sales Hub was our fastest growing hub in the quarter in terms of new business with 18 of the top 25 wins including Sales Hub. It is becoming a sustainable front door to HubSpot and I'm thrilled with the momentum we are seeing after the relaunch. Overall, 2023 was a banner year for product innovation with over 800 product enhancements across our hubs and entire platform. We want to be the market share leader in marketing, sales and service for scaling companies and we doubled down on core hubs to deliver even more value to customers. In addition to relaunching Sales Hub, we enhanced Marketing Hub with more omni-channel features like Instagram reels and introduced more robust insights with customer journey analytics. With Service Hub, we introduced multiple knowledge bases, which was a top customer request and advanced our vision of a modern helpdesk. And of course, the big headline in 2023 was the launch of HubSpot AI. We were early with Gen AI beta launches and have embedded AI features across our entire platform and hubs so customers can get the power of AI without needing to become AI experts. Reflecting on 2023, we moved fast with AI to drive innovation for our customers. We doubled down on core hubs to further establish ourselves as the platform of choice for scaling companies and we focused on consistent execution of our bimodal strategy. I'm thrilled with the innovation the team delivered in 2023 and look forward to driving even more value for our customers this year. Okay, I want to quickly touch on what we're seeing in the macro environment. Throughout 2023, we saw customers tightening their budgets, deal cycles taking longer and overall scrutiny in the buying process. Though these trends continued in Q4, we saw some buyer urgency at the end of the year, driving sequential improvement in large deals. Customers are simplifying and consolidating on fewer, more effective platforms, and this translated to stable gross retention and more multi-hub wins for HubSpot. That said, we're not sounding the all clear just yet, as we continue to see cautious buying and multiple decision makers involved in deals. Overall, we expect this choppy environment to persist, and we will remain focused on HubSpot's specific growth, drivers and execution in 2024. Shifting gears I want to share context on the pricing change we recently announced and the strategic rationale behind it. As we have evolved from an app to suite to customer platform, we've had a simple strategy, make HubSpot easy-to-use and easy-to-buy. We're doubling down on the strategy to make HubSpot even easier to buy. That's why we announced a new seat space pricing model on January 30 that will go into effect for all new customers on March 5. For existing customers, pricing will remain the same at the time of the migration, but they will see a price increase of 5% or less at the time of their next renewal. Now, there are three reasons for this shift. First, we want to make it even easier for customers to get started with HubSpot, and therefore we're removing seat minimums for Sales Hub and Service Hub. This will remove friction for customers and will help us accelerate market share gains. Second, we want to make it easier for customers to upgrade from Starter. We have heard feedback that the price jump from Starter to Pro or Enterprise is high. This is a point of friction as customers look to upgrade. So we're changing the Pro and Enterprise seat pricing for Sales Hub and Service Hub and we are introducing view only seats, core seats for users who want to edit, and specialized seats for users who need specific functionality like sales or service. This change will bridge the gap between Starter and Pro, and drive more Pro plus adoption and upgrades. Third, and perhaps most importantly, we're aligning price to the value from our AI-Powered smart CRM. We've invested heavily in our smart CRM over the past few years to make it more customizable, extensible and easier to integrate with. The easiest way for you to think about smart CRM is it's the unified customer record, which enables our customers to have a single view of their customers. Now, customers can continue to view the CRM for free, but will need a core seat to edit it. This expands our ability to monetize beyond core personas to ops, admin finance personas who may need more powerful edit capabilities. In addition, we have embedded HubSpot AI across our entire platform and hubs, which means that customers at every tier can access AI features at no additional cost. This differentiated strategy should drive even more adoption of HubSpot AI and drive more upgrades as we continue to add value in higher tiers. We launched the seats pricing changes as a pilot in ANZ in April 2023 and we have fine-tuned our execution based on customer, partner and sales feedback. For the global launch in March we are hyper focused on enabling our teams and partners to communicate the value of the changes to customers. Overall, I'm really excited about our pricing model evolution. It's going to make HubSpot easier to buy and easier to scale as our product grows, while matching how we monetize the platform based on the value we deliver to customers. Okay, I want to wrap up by sharing our strategy for 2024 and how we are balancing growth, profitability and culture to drive durable growth. Our strategy is working and we have high conviction in our strategic choices. We remain focused on SMBs, a very large growing and underserved market, and we are well positioned to innovate and be a leader in this market. The way we differentiate is by making our products easy to buy, easy to adopt and easy to use. In 2024, we will double down on our playbook of driving the pace of product innovation, focusing on consistent execution and building a high performing, sustainable company. On the product side, you can expect to see us take big swings in AI, build deeper and more sophisticated upmarket functionality, and focus on driving product usage across all hubs and platforms. AI in 2023 was all about speed and being fast to market. 2024 is going to be all about delivering value. We are doubling down on HubSpot AI use cases that are driving repeat usage and will innovate even more with AI agents. With our core hubs, we will continue to go deep on the key use cases our customers need across marketing, sales and service, and bring more upmarket sophistication to Sales Hub and Service Hub specifically. Thanks so much Kate. I want to close by highlighting our momentum in becoming the customer platform of choice for scaling companies. G2 recently released their annual Best Software Awards and HubSpot was recognized as the number one sales product and the number one marketing product in 2024. This recognition is a strong testament to the pace of innovation we are driving and our focus on delivering value. My huge, heartfelt thank you to our employees who work tirelessly to solve for our customers, and a big thank you to our partners, customers and shareholders for the continued support. With that operator, let's please open up the call for questions. Hey Samad, thanks a lot. Maybe to address multiple questions that you asked there, we have always been easy-to-buy and easy-to-use and we are just doubling down to make HubSpot even easier to buy. This change has been probably a couple of years in the making, and we got started with these changes by talking to our customers, to hear from them in terms of where they experience points of friction in the buying journey and where they're seeing value. That's how we got started. And I talked about the three shifts and it's easy to see how this all adds up. The first shift is, we want it to be super easy for customers to get started with HubSpot, so we're removing the seat minimum. What we have seen in the pilot and what we expect in terms of this change is it will result in more customers starting with HubSpot and higher volume of Starter customers over a period of time. The second thing we did is we reduced the price jump between Starter and Pro. And you've asked us this before. Our customers have consistently given us the feedback that the jump from Starter to Pro is really high and that's a point of friction for our customers. By lowering the price per seat for Pro and Enterprise, it reduces that friction. And again, we're seeing that in making this change, there are more customers that start with Starter and then continue to upgrade into Pro and Enterprise, which is exactly what we want in order to have a great foundation for pricing. And the third, and probably most importantly, we're now monetizing the value of smart CRM. We've invested pretty heavily in smart CRM over the past few years. We've made it customizable, we've made it extensible, we've made it easier to integrate with, and this change allows us to monetize. You asked specifically about how does this compare to the rest and what are we beginning to see? I think you're going to see more volume, because we have removed the friction, both in terms of Starter and Pro, and then over a period of time the biggest opportunity is really post sales expansion and growth. When we sign more customers, then reps have the capacity to go back and sell more in terms of cross sell opportunities. When customers start with exactly what they need, then they now will buy more seats as they continue to expand and core seats is a new upgrade lever. So this is a foundational shift that removes friction and provides value and gives us the ability to continue to expand over the next multiple years. So we're really excited about this change. Yeah, so maybe just to address the basics, so we now have three seat types. The first is just a view only seat. If anybody within the whole company wants to view it, that's the seat view. The second type of seat, and this is probably the new change that we are introducing, is in core seat and this is really associated with the smart CRM. And then the third is the specialized seat if you need a Sales Hub specialized functionality or Service Hub specialized functionality. To take a moment and maybe talk about the biggest change, which is that core seat, we talked about smart CRM at INBOUND and the easiest way to think about smart CRM is it's a core system of customer records. If you want contact information, you want company information, if you want information on the interactions in your customer, all of that is associated with that smart CRM layer. And over the past few years, as we look at where customers are spending the most time and getting value, they will tell you that it is from having a single unified view of the customer. And what we have done with this pricing model change is if you want to view it, you can use the free seat, but if you want to edit anything within that core CRM, you will need to buy a core seat. So by monetizing that smart CRM, we're aligning the value where customers are getting to our monetization strategy, and it really goes back to our core pricing philosophy. We add value, and then when we know we have added a ton of value, then we align the monetization. Yes, that's a great question Mark. I want to say that our AI is embedded. It is not free, and there is a difference between those two. And maybe just step back, this is very, very consistent with what we communicated as our AI monetization strategy at Analyst Day. It's very, very early stages on a very massive shift in the industry, and we are focused on driving value and making it super easy for scaling companies to just adopt AI. That's why we've taken this strategy and we've embedded AI into platform and all of the hubs, and by including the AI into our platform and hubs, we're just driving acquisition of customers. That's number one. The second thing which is important to note is that while all of our tiers, Premium, Starter, Pro and Enterprise have AI features, we have a lot more features at the pro and enterprise tiers. And in fact, 65% of the features that are becoming generally available in the first half of 2024 will be in the Pro Plus tier. So the way we think about it is that it'll drive a lot of upgrades and higher ASP in terms of tier upgrades. And then longer term, when we drive even more sophisticated features like AI agents, then we may charge specifically for it. So going back to kind of your question on how do you make sure that in its scale right now we think we're in the early stages removing friction, educating customers, driving adoption, making sure there's repeat usage, that's the focus. And based on what we're seeing, we're not quite worried about the cost impact, but if we continue to introduce very sophisticated features where it has an impact, then we will charge for it. So that's how we're thinking about monetizing. Thank you, Rishi for that question. Maybe the way I'd characterize it was 2023. 2023 was a year of experimentation and this year is going to be all about delivering customer value. And probably the most important leading indicator that we are looking for is repeat usage of AI features. So the focus for the product team, the focus for the go to market team is really one, educating customers and two, making sure that any feature that we have out is driving repeat usage. That's the focus. You asked about, what are we learning? We're definitely seeing a lot of adoption, but there is some signal, some noise. And as I look at our top maybe 20 customers who are leveraging AI effectively, there are a few key trends. The first one is prospecting and company research is really, really a big use case and ChatSpot is driving that. We have over 200,000 cumulative users on ChatSpot and more than 20,000 monthly active users, and they're just wanting to use AI for better researching companies, better preparation before they talk to customers and that's great. Marketing, not a surprise at all, but the use cases and marketing that we started with the launch of content assistance last year is now getting well integrated into the flow of work. So marketers using generative AI for creating blogs, creating emails, creating titles, taking one content, and then modifying that content into multiple channels, that is becoming very common and we are seeing those use cases get into the daily action. The third and probably not a surprise again, is Service Hub. Our highest usage in terms of features is summarizing conversations and then generating takeaways that feature, and specifically, there's something called highlight command, and we're very surprised by this, but being able to highlight a particular text and then change the tone, change the, expand the text, that is getting almost daily usage. And so, I think we're seeing areas where it is deeply integrated into the flow of work and we're beginning to see much more usage. And we have a very robust roadmap of AI features that's coming up. A lot of those features are in kind of the Pro Plus categories, and I'm really excited to see the usage metrics go up. So a lot of the work that we're going to be doing this year is looking for those usage patterns. And Keith, on your question in terms of impact of the pricing changes for existing customers, we are being very thoughtful in how we roll this out to our existing customers and couple of maybe first principles as we do this. One, we don't want the customer experience as they go from one pricing model to another to even be noticeable. That's one principle. The second is we don't want any surprises for existing customers as they kind of go through this pricing change. So as I mentioned in March, what we're launching is only for new customers. The migration for existing customers to the new model, which means having view only seats, having core seats, and having specialized seats, that migration will begin mid-2024 and it will go through 2025 in waves. So that again, the experience for customers is seamless. They probably won't even notice that they have been migrated on the back end to support the new deep model. Then at the first renewal after migration, customers can expect up to 5% increase, no more than 5% increase, and that way they have visibility in terms of the level of change that they can expect. We've started doing this as part of our ANZ pilot and we're finding that it's a very seamless kind of motion for existing customers with plenty of time for them to adjust to kind of the new motion. Yes. Overall, the strength just is consistent across international and North America. We talked about the bigger trends that we saw in Q4, which is large yield momentum, Sales Hub momentum, multi-hub momentum. We kind of saw the same trends in North America as we saw within the international markets and very consistent with prior quarters. Yes, that's a great question. We are definitely pleased with the momentum in Service Hub, both from a product perspective as well as customer adoption perspective. As you know, last year was a pretty big year for Service Hub Pro. We did a ton of work to make the pro tier very, very powerful and we also added some differentiating features on the enterprise tiers. And based on the work that the team did, we saw a lot more adoption upmarket. When we talk about multi-hub wins, there are more customers now, starting with two, three hubs. And when we see that the power of having all of your customer information in one platform and therefore including Service Hub there has become pattern. So we're very, very happy about that. I think we're not done yet. I think there's just a tremendous amount of work that we're going to be doing in the Service Hub area this year to make it even more competitive. AI is a pretty big lever in terms of Service Hub, the kinds of use cases that we're seeing and attraction of use cases that we're seeing. I talked about summarizing conversations, highlighting commands for content generation, and editing answers. All of that is driving a lot more effectiveness within our Service Hub customers and also driving engagement. So we're very excited about the trajectory. Now, stepping back, we have a playbook with Sales Hub and you can see it's working. When we focus the product organization, when we align the go to market teams, we know how to get that to a front door. I think we can apply the same kind of playbook for Service Hub. It will get into the same trajectory as Sales Hub as we continue to innovate for our customers. Yes, thank you so much. The partner momentum continues to grow I just spent a bunch of time with partners this week and we're all doing the kickoffs ready for 2024 and there continues to be good momentum and excitement within the partner channel. As you know, partners contribute to about 40% of our ARR and that has continued to grow as we have scaled maybe to step back. We have a very, very clear strategy with partners. We've gone to our partners and we said we want to scale selling, co-selling and servicing with you and we want you to become experts of the entire customer platform. And this journey is something that has been on the making for the past three years and partners have enrolled in that journey. More partners are now well versed in overall CRM, the entire customer platform. They know the value proposition of multiple hubs. They're able to get our customers started with greater onboarding, better engagement and then continue to drive multiple hub adoption. And so I think you're seeing partners gain even more traction with us upmarket and you're seeing partners drive multi-hub momentum as well as larger deals upmarket. And so it's become a really nice growth lever to continue to grow the ecosystem for us. Yes, I know. Urgency is definitely not something that we have heard in the past few quarters and so we definitely saw it towards the end of the quarter, especially with larger deals and multi-hub wins. In upmarket, we saw customers wanting to consolidate into fewer effective platforms, both to reduce the total cost of ownership as well as to get better visibility across sales and marketing as they set up for the new year. So a lot of the conversations that we had towards the end of the quarter were, how do we consolidate, how do we get better visibility so we can set up a growth in 2024? I do think that our fast time to value, easy to adopt but very powerful tools is just compelling, and we saw that towards the end of the year. I think, like I said earlier in the prepared remarks, it doesn't mean that the whole environment has shifted. We are really not ready to call it all clear in terms of the patterns, but the value proposition upmarket is certainly resonating and that translated into large deal strength. Well, thank you so much for your support, and we look forward to connecting back again in the quarter."

Now it's my pleasure to turn over the call to HubSpot's Chief Executive Officer, Yamini Rangan. Yamini?\nYamini Rangan: Thank you, Chuck, and welcome to everyone joining us on the call. Let me start with our performance in the quarter, share my observations on the macro environment and wrap up with our vision for our customer platform powered by AI and data.  Let's jump into our Q3 results. We had another quarter of solid execution with revenue growing 24% year-over-year in constant currency. We delivered another exceptional quarter of operating margin growth with 700 basis points of margin expansion year-over-year, driving our operating margin to 16%. Total customers grew by 22% year-over-year to over 194,000 customers globally, driven by over 9,100 net customer additions in the quarter. I'm pleased with our team's focused execution and the progress we are making to become the #1 customer platform for scaling companies.  Our Q3 results highlight two consistent themes this year. Our bimodal go-to-market strategy is working, and our product innovation is in high gear, especially coming out of inbound in September. In the lower end of our segments, we saw strength in net customer additions driven by free sign-ups and growth optimization plays in our starter addition. Our value proposition of an easy-to-use, easy-to-scale customer platform resonates within the segment.  In upmarket, we continue to see multi-hub adoption as customers consolidate on fewer platforms and drive better visibility across marketing, sales and service. A great example of a multi-hub customer who's seeing results from consolidating on HubSpot is Knowledge Academy. They are the largest provider of online instructor-led training globally. They started with Sales Hub to get better visibility into their pipeline and then added Marketing Hub to optimize their marketing budget and also added Service Hub to get a complete view of their customers.  Since implementing HubSpot, Knowledge Academy has grown leads by 4x, boosted sales by nearly 2x and increased their average order value by 25%. As you've heard me say before, our hubs are powerful on their own, but the real value for our customers comes from using them together. And we can see this in our results with over 50% of our installed base now on three or more hubs.  Turning to product innovation. We continue to be in high gear, and our launches at INBOUND are driving momentum. While we have launched over 200 new product enhancements this year, the two big moments at inbound, where the Sales Hub relaunched and HubSpot AI launch. So why did we relaunch Sales Hub and we are already seeing momentum within this hub this year? Simple. We want to deliver the best prospecting and deal management solutions that are deeply connected especially for our upmarket customers.  The new prospecting workspace, which is now generally available, gives reps one place to organize their leads and pass so that they can spend less time looking for information and more time connecting with customers. In deal management, we introduced AI-powered forecasting to help sales leaders improve accuracy in revenue projections, very important in any environment. We have a compelling vision to drive sales productivity, and we are hearing positive feedback from our customers, particularly in upmarket about the new found power and sophistication of Sales Hub.  Another highlight that inbound was the launch of HubSpot AI. We believe that every scaling organization deserves an AI-powered customer platform. And that is why we are deeply embedding AI across all of our hubs and our entire platform. We announced a number of features across AI assistance, AI agents, AI insights and ChatSpot. While I'm certainly excited about our pace of innovation, what we are really focused on is driving usage and value for customers. 40% of enterprise customers have already used HubSpot AI features, along with 20% of pro customers. About 2/3 of AI users are leveraging AI assistance to craft marketing e-mails and blogs. Social publishing is proving out to be a sticky use case, drawing in engaged users. In short, when we embed AI into the flow of work it works. I'm pleased to see usage beginning to grow, and we know we're still in the early stages of a major technology shift.  Looking ahead, we're focused on driving discoverability of and differentiation with AI features. We will drive adoption both in product and via customer education. We will drive differentiation by bringing more sophisticated use cases that are more deeply connected with HubSpot data. To summarize, I like the early adoption trends. and our well-defined AI road map to bring innovation to our customers.  Okay. Let's shift gears and talk about what we're seeing in the macro environment. Overall, we continue to operate in a choppy and challenging environment. Sales cycles remain lumpy, budgets are still under scrutiny and buying urgency remains low. It is clear based on my conversations with customers that they still need approvals from multiple decision makers and are continuing to optimize spend. Despite these headwinds, HubSpot's connected value proposition continues to resonate with customers looking to optimize spend and boost productivity. As we look ahead, we will continue to navigate this macro environment by following our playbook to drive product innovation and consistent strong execution.  Now I want to dive deep into our vision for our customer platform and talk about how our recently signed agreement to acquire Clearbit accelerates that vision. Our vision is to give millions of companies the best possible data about their customers in HubSpot. Today, we pull in data from website visits, marketing e-mails, sales calls, support tickets and more. And we unify all of that data on a beautiful, simple customer record. This is arguably the biggest advantage with HubSpot. With Clearbit, we will be able to bring in even more external data that can help our customers connect better with their end customers. So what can we solve for our customers with more unified data.  While we can help our customers identify great fit customers and provide clear signals on buying intent, both keys to increasing their go-to-market effectiveness. Our customers want company data, not just the name of the company and employee count, but they want rich attributes about companies including demographic data, like who is the CIO and techno-graphic data like which automation products are they using? In addition, they want a real-time way to monitor buying intent. Not just based on direct engagements within HubSpot platform but also based on customers' activities outside of HubSpot and around the web.  This is exactly what Clearbit is good at. They have 100-plus attributes for more than 20 million companies from more than 250-plus public and private data sources. We can take all of those data from HubSpot and Clearbit to power generative AI tools to create even more personal messages and insights for customers. Our differentiation will be to bring together a unified customer data with powerful AI tools that can consume that data and our market-leading engagement hub to supercharge our customers' go-to-market efforts.  Finally, why Clearbit? And what are our plans going forward? Clearbit has world-class data, and they share our commitment to helping customers grow. They also have a deep bench of B2B data experts with a bold mission to leverage AI to power insight. In all our conversations with Clearbit, it was clear that the team would be a great addition to our culture. And most importantly, this does not take away from our approach to building great products with cohesive user experiences. We use Clearbit data on our product today, and we have a very clear vision for how we can integrate their data to provide immediate value for our customers. In addition, we can leverage our product-led partner-led and sales-led distribution engines to get this into the hands of our customers post close. I'm thrilled by the prospect of acquiring Clearbit and our shared vision of solving for the customer. We will share more about our future plans after the deal has closed.  So reflecting on the quarter, we doubled down on product innovation in our core hubs and we established leadership in AI with our customers. Our teams are focused on consistent execution, and we have a clear vision for taking our customer platform to the next level with AI and data to deliver even more value to our customers.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Kate to take you through Q3 results in more detail. Kate?\nKathryn Bueker: Thanks, Yamini. Let's turn to our third quarter 2023 financial results. Revenue grew 24% year-over-year in constant currency and 26% on an as-reported basis. Subscription revenue grew 25% year-over-year while services and other revenue increased 31% on an as-reported basis. Domestic revenue grew 22% year-over-year, international revenue growth was 26% in constant currency and 30% as reported, now representing 47% of total revenue.  We added 9,100 net new customers in the quarter, bringing our total customer count to over 194,000, up 22% year-over-year. Average subscription revenue per customer grew 1% year-over-year in constant currency and 3% on an as-reported basis to $11,500. Our ASRPC growth was driven by continued multi-hub adoption by our professional and enterprise customers, offset by the large volume of starter customers we added at the low end of our bimodal strategy over the last few quarters. Gross retention remained healthy in the high 80s for the quarter, and net revenue retention was up slightly quarter-over-quarter.  We continue to see pressure on net upgrade motions, including seats, contact tiers, additions and portals and expect this to persist in the short term. Nevertheless, we remain confident that we can maintain net revenue retention above 100%. Calculated billings were $550 million, growing 20% year-over-year in constant currency and 24% as reported. The remainder of my comments will refer to non-GAAP measures. Operating margin was 16%, up 7 points compared to the year ago period. Operating margin in the quarter benefited from lower T&E and other discretionary spend, continued infrastructure optimization and more concentrated hiring in Q3 and Q4 in key areas such as product innovation, AI and internal systems and data. Net income was $83 million or $1.59 per fully diluted share.  Free cash flow was $65 million or 12% of revenue, and our cash and marketable securities totaled $1.7 billion at the end of September. On October 31, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Clearbit for approximately $150 million in cash. The acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approval and we expect the transaction to close before the end of the year.  Like Yamini, I am excited about the value we can create for our customers with the combination of Clearbit's world-class data and HubSpot's AI-powered customer platform, and I look forward to welcoming the Clearbit team to HubSpot.  Okay. Before we dive into guidance, I wanted to touch quickly on the macro environment. As Yamini indicated, we continue to operate in a challenging environment. Q3 felt similar to what we saw in the first half of the year. Budgets are still under scrutiny deals are taking longer to close, buying urgency is low and customers are continuing to look for ways to optimize their spend. Our guidance assumes that these weak conditions persist in Q4.  Now let's review our guidance for the fourth quarter and full year of 2023. For the fourth quarter, total as reported revenue is expected to be in the range of $556 million to $558 million, up 19% year-over-year at the midpoint. We expect foreign exchange to be a 2-point tailwind to as reported revenue growth in the quarter. Non-GAAP operating profit is expected to be between $85 million and $86 million. Non-GAAP diluted net income per share is expected to be between $1.53 and $1.55. This assumes 52.7 million fully diluted shares outstanding. And for the full year of 2023, total as reported revenue is now expected to be in the range of $2.144 billion to $2.146 billion, up 24% year-over-year at the midpoint. We now expect foreign exchange to have no material impact on as reported revenue growth for the full year.  Non-GAAP operating profit is now expected to be between $317 million and $318 million. Non-GAAP diluted net income per share is now expected to be between $5.66 and $5.68. This assumes 52.2 million fully diluted shares outstanding. As you adjust your models, keep in mind the following: we continue to expect CapEx as a percentage of revenue to be roughly 5% and now expect free cash flow to be about $275 million for the full year of 2023. Looking forward to 2024, we expect foreign exchange to be a 1- to 2-point headwind to as reported revenue growth.  And with that, I will hand things back over to Yamini for her closing remarks.\nYamini Rangan: Thank you so much, Kate. I want to close by reiterating our commitment to balancing growth, profitability and a great culture to build an enduring company. We're driving rapid innovation with our customer platform and HubSpot AI to drive growth. We're focused on improving sales and marketing efficiency and scaling distribution. And on culture, we remain committed to building a high-performing, sustainable and diverse culture. This quarter, we hosted our first-ever Global Leadership Summit, which brought together our top leaders across the globe for workshops, trainings on performance, leadership and strategy. It was just a fantastic week and left me energized about HubSpot's future. A huge thank you to all our employees and partners for their dedication to driving results and to our customers and shareholders for their continued support on this journey.  With that, operator, let's please open up the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from the line of Arjun Bhatia with William Blair.\nArjun Bhatia: Yamini, you called out macro headwinds. I know that's similar to what you called out in prior quarters, but it seems like despite the challenging environment, we're not really seeing the slowdown take hold in the fundamentals, the net new revs are strong, the new customers are strong. Is this something that you're seeing get worse, get better? Or is this something that you're kind of anticipating in Q4 that there are signals that maybe things are a little bit tougher heading into the holiday season. And if we do kind of continue down this path, how are you thinking about adjusting your bimodal go-to-market strategy between the new and the mid-market upsell existing do you mean heavily -- more heavily one way or another as a result of that?\nYamini Rangan: Arjun, yes, thanks for that question. Look, as both I said and Kate said, the environment continues to be choppy and challenging and customer urgency remains low. More broadly speaking, what we are seeing in second half as customer trends is very similar to what we saw in the first half of 2023. It's not gotten better and it's not gotten worse. And when we are looking at our pipeline and we have conversations with customers, we see more decision-makers involved in the process, more budget scrutiny, continued optimization of spend. Deals are definitely closing, but it takes more conversations, more demos and more time.  Now having said that, I think we've consistently executed in this type of a choppy and challenging environment. And when I look at the pipeline going into Q4, when I have conversations with customers, couple of things stand out. One is customers are focused on consolidating on fewer platforms to eliminate spend, this is exactly where HubSpot's value proposition really resonates, and we are helping consolidate point solutions for customers. And the second is they are focused on increasing productivity, especially because they're not increasing head count. And again, our quick time to value and the ease with which they can scale with our products is really helping.  So we are going to remain very laser-focused on executing in this environment, and we are assuming that this environment will continue into Q4 I don't think that changes our bimodal strategy. In fact, what has been good is that we have been consistently executing on a bimodal strategy to increase volume at the bottom and continue to deliver value at the top and we'll continue to drive product innovation to be able to win within this environment.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Samad Samana with Jefferies.\nSamad Samana: Great. Kate, maybe for you. I think the increase in NRR quarter-over-quarter is really encouraging. I guess if you think about the slide at the Analyst Day, where you broke the pieces by what things were changing, consumption versus value. Can you maybe help us understand what you saw quarter-over-quarter and just maybe what the trend line looks like through the first few weeks of the fourth quarter and what you may be assuming for those two trends?\nKathryn Bueker: Yes. Sure thing. Thanks, Samad. You rightly indicated, Net New ARR was up slightly in Q3. The drivers of net revenue retention were very much the same ones that we talked about at Analyst Day and frankly, that we've been talking about for the last sort of 4 to 6 quarters here. The highlight continues to be customer dollar retention. Customer dollar retention is holding nicely in the high 80s. We typically see a little seasonal step-up in customer dollar retention in Q3. We did see that again this year.  The downside here is that we continue to see a challenge in this net upgrade motion, and it's both on more downgrades. So more customers continuing to optimize their spend with HubSpot and also less volume of customers upgrading. And it's all the same motion that we talked about at Analyst Day. On the downgrade side, it is the consumption-based motions of seats and contact as well as additions. And it is fewer customers adding seats and contact tiers.  Nothing to report in terms of a change in the net revenue retention trajectory in Q4. As I said at Analyst Day and I'd reiterate here, in order for us to really see that in flex we would really want to see the external environment improve, which we think is first going to show up in downgrade pressure lessening and then we would see a follow-on effect of more customers starting to add the -- starting to add contact tiers. So it's largely a function of the external environment turning around.\nDharmesh Shah: Yes. And I just want to clarify, we talked about net revenue retention being up slightly sequentially, not Net New ARR. So I just want to make sure that we're clear on that. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. The next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan.\nMark Murphy: Yamini, we continue to hear that the decoupling of Sales Hub from the Smart CRM is a big positive development and a major unlock for some future opportunities. Can you walk us through the strategic rationale that we're decoupling is how partners we're referring to it, by the way. Just what was the rationale and how that might open up some new opportunities for companies to engage with HubSpot?\nYamini Rangan: Thank you, Mark. And I just love that you picked it up that you're clearly calling out that separation of the Smart CRM from Sales Hub, in particular, but just the hubs. And maybe explaining the strategy. So when we went into this year, we said that, one, we want to become absolute product and thought leaders in terms of our marketing hub, sales hub and service hub. And I credit this to Andy Pitre, our Head of Product, but he came in and he said, we're going to focus on two or three big use cases per hub. And specifically for Sales Hub, we picked prospecting and deal management. And these two are really important because prospecting obviously increases the productivity of sales reps and deal management with AI and forecasting improves the effectiveness of sales management and leaders. And so those were the two things. And at INBOUND, we relaunched Sales Hub we reinvented what prospecting and deal management look like, and that's gotten pretty significant traction.  So the other thing that we did is we separated out smart CRM from each of our engagement hubs. The reason is this, Smart CRM now, we've been investing in it for multiple quarters and it's now become a clear unified customer record that can be customized, that can be extended and where people can kind of bring information and continue to expand the use of HubSpot, and it's clearly different in value from the engagement hubs. And so we separated it out and I think partners love it. Customers now have even more clarity, and it's going to drive the overall adoption of the customer platform.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Brian C. Peterson with Raymond James.\nBrian Peterson: I'll echo my congrats. Maybe a product question for me. Can you discuss some of the AI announcements coming out of INBOUND earlier this year? How is that influencing your 2024 road map? And anything interesting that came out of the OpenAI event this week as it relates to HubSpot.\nDharmesh Shah: Thanks for the question, Brian. So we're really thrilled with the kind of adoption of HubSpot AI after its launch at INBOUND. And we're particularly pleased with the repeat usage we're getting out of some of the marketing oriented use cases. And as Yamini mentioned in the opening comments, one thing we've learned is that if you can put these AI features right where people do their work, it works. And so we're continuing to double down on that. AI is the -- literally the #1 priority on the HubSpot product road map going into 2024. We're super excited. And one thing we're going to do is take the lessons from the adoption that we've seen so far, and we're taking a ChatSpot, and we're going to kind of leave it through the entire platform. So we have a natural language interface and kind of add the Smart and Smart CRM within HubSpot. So that's kind of high on the list.  In terms of OpenAI in their recent conference they had just 2 days ago on Monday. Super exciting things. Here are things that are most relevant that has -- and we've been working with them on preview releases of what just got announced. The #1 thing is they launched a new version of their model called GPT-4 Turbo, which is as the name implies, is faster. But the thing that's much more exciting about it is that they expanded the context window. And without getting too geeky, the context window defines how much data you can pass, how much information when you prompt the LLM when you ask a question. And they went from 8,000 tokens, which was a default before to 128,000 tokens. And to put that in context, that's equivalent of a 300-page book.  Now here's why that's important for HubSpot. When we're generating, let's say, a sales e-mail that says, \"Oh, we want to do an upgrade sales to this particular customer\", now we can take all the information that's in the HubSpot Smart CRM on this unified data record and take all that context and pass it to the LLM in real time so that when it crafts that message, it does the best job possible.  What has me even more excited, so it's not just the CRM data that we have now, imagine in the future, we have Clearbit data, where we have all this information, all these 200 attributes, all this intent data, we can bring that all together into one single kind of prompt to the LLM and it can take all that information in real time and craft these really, really pointed effective messages. So super exciting going into 2024.  And then one for Kate here is that one thing they did announce is that the cost for all this kind of invocation of their latest model is going down. Our estimates are somewhere around 50% to 70% based on our usage once this goes into GA. So lots to be excited about AI is massively exciting going into 2024. Thanks for the question.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Rishi Jaluria with RBC.\nRishi Jaluria: Wonderful. I just wanted to dive a little bit deeper into a Clearbit really exciting acquisition. I heard some good things about the company. Can you talk a little bit about how this is going to impact your relationship with other players in the space? Including ZoomInfo, which is popular to use along HubSpot, Apollo, we actually saw HubSpot speaking at Apollo's user event earlier today. And maybe alongside that, I know privacy is obviously is very, very important. How do you think about just dealing with some of the maybe privacy and governance concerns that might come with something that is serving up data.\nYamini Rangan: Rishi, I'll take that multipart question. Maybe start with the vision and then the competitive landscape and then how we're thinking about privacy. Look, we're super excited about Clearbit and how they'll help us accelerate our vision for the customer platform. And what we're doing is we're bringing together this data and powerful AI tools that can consume that data and world-class engagement hubs, and that will help our customers connect and grow better.  And if we step back and think about the rationale for us, the age-old problem with CRM is that when you open up the box and set it up, it's empty. And our customers want us to pre-fill it with data on day 1. They want us to pre-fill it with company data, who else can they sell to, intent data, who else is looking to buy their products and services and contact data, who do we connect to. And this makes complete sense for our customers. And it solves a huge problem for them. And that's why Clearbit makes sense. Like I just mentioned in the prepared remarks, they have 20 million company profiles with rich attributes for each of these companies and makes absolute sense, especially in the world of AI.  And in terms of the competitive landscape, this is not about us entering a database. This is much more about us accelerating our customer platform vision. And vision that we have articulated is we want to have engagement hubs powered by a Smart CRM, powered by data, powered by AI that helps our customers grow. That's what we are accelerating. And the word platform really means we'll continue to operate in a very open ecosystem. And if our customers choose to work with Zoominfo and Apollo, we welcome that, and we'll continue to have a very open platform as well as ecosystem.  And I think in terms of the final part of your 3-part question, which is how do we think about data privacy. Look, we know our customers value having trust in our security privacy practices. And our level of commitment to security, privacy and governance will not change as we look at integrating the data asset. When it came to e-mail deliverability, we took the right side of the road in terms of how to help our customers deliver e-mails, but do it in a very thoughtful manner, and that's the same way in which we will look at this as we go into accelerating our vision. Overall, super excited. I have to say that the feedback from customers and partners has been really, really positive in the last week.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin from Wolfe Research.\nAleksandr Zukin: Maybe just a quick 2-parter for me. As we think about this macroeconomic environment, I know we're guiding one quarter at a time, but at this point, we're starting to kind of get our models ready for next year. Is it fair to assume that you're kind of planning for this type of environment to persist and continue. And anything that we should think about or keep in mind as we start tuning our models for next year, or thinking about. You mentioned FX and the headwind there. But anything about from either billings or I don't know the -- just the retention environment or the putting in Clearbit into the numbers, anything there would be super helpful. And maybe just as an adjunct, any thoughts around for next year. As we think about AI monetization pathways, is it more around tiering up into more premium hubs? Is it new product modalities? Anything helpful there?\nKathryn Bueker: Maybe I'll start and talk through a bit of the -- how do we think about the economic environment in setting guidance. Certainly, Yamini and I said this in the prepared remarks, it continues to be a very challenging external environment. We believe that, that environment will continue to be challenging through the end of this year. It's frankly a little too early to talk about next year. We will give, as you know, formal guidance on our Q4 call.  In February, what you should have heard Yamini say is really like we have very clear focus areas. We're focused on productization, we're focused on AI. We're executing really well. And we feel really good about how that sets us up when the economy does turn. That's the expectation is that things remain challenging, at least through early next year.\nYamini Rangan: And I think on the last part of your question from an AI monetization perspective, really no change from what we walked you all through at Analyst Day. We're really focused on delivering that road map, most of the features that we announced at INBOUND are either generally available now or getting close to general availability by early Q1, and that's when we'll share even more specifics about AI, but overall consistent with what we shared with you at the Analyst Day.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Brad Sills with Bank of America.\nBradley Sills: Great. I wanted to ask a question around the net add strength. Clearly, Starter has been holding up real nicely through the challenging macro. The question is, why is that, do you think? Is it just simply larger customers that might be starting with a higher-priced offering like Pro are starting with Starter in a challenging environment, with plans to go to Pro. And then what do you think about that cohort of customer? It's been three or four quarters since you've cited strength here, in Starter net adds. Is there a cohort of customer in there that you think coming out of the macro, we could see some nice acceleration. Maybe it's just from a better macro or some of the uptake on AI features that might be going into the Pro and enterprise version.\nKathryn Bueker: Yes, maybe I will start. Brad, thank you very much. We were very happy with the level of new customer additions for the quarter. You are also right, the increase in the new customer additions quarter-over-quarter is very much driven by the Starter addition. You heard Yamini talk about the bimodal strategy as being one of the things that's really working for us. And as we talked about at Analyst Day, the goal of the low end of the bimodal strategy is really to maximize the volume of customers that we can bring on to the platform. And so as a result, we are constantly running experiments to try to drive volume into our Starter tier. We certainly watch the characteristics of those cohorts to make sure that we feel really good about their ability to retain an upgrade.  This quarter was no different. There were a number of experiments that we ran across pricing and packaging as well as a number of plays that we ran to really lean into activation and conversion of free users into starter customers. So we're feeling really good about it.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Gabriela Board with Goldman Sachs.\nJacob Titleman: This is Jake Titleman on for Gabriela. Congrats on a great quarter. I want to ask the net adds question slightly differently. Before the pandemic, HubSpot was adding closer to 15,000 new customers each year. Since then, net adds have trended over 30,000 annually. Do you view this shift as cyclical? Or are there structural drivers that lead you to believe HubSpot can sustain this level of net adds going forward?\nKathryn Bueker: Thanks for the question. I think that it is very purposeful. So we have -- you've heard us talk about the fact that when we entered the early stages of the pandemic, we made a change from a pricing and packaging perspective to really dramatically lower the price point for Starter. And we were frankly surprised at how sensitive to that pricing potential customers work. And so we have taken that learning and really leaned into it through what we've been referring to as the bimodal strategy, but we are getting better and better at running experiments at that low end to drive volume, and we feel good about our ability to continue to deliver that customer adds, call it at the high end of that 7,000 to 8,000 range that we've been talking about for the last couple of quarters.\nYamini Rangan: And maybe the point to add here is that the success that we see is a testament to us becoming a platform of choice for SMBs. Part of the strategy is to get companies started early in their digital journey with us, continue to deliver value as they scale. And so that clear strategy and value proposition of making it easy to buy and easy to use and easy to scale, that is what resonates. And so we're pleased with it. And I think we'll continue with that bimodal strategy into next year.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Derrick Wood with Cowen.\nJames Wood: Yamini, at the upper end of the CRM market in the enterprise, there are a lot of different sales tools being used for things like prospecting, sales enablement, revenue intelligence. I'm curious, do you see that kind of fragmentation in the SMB mid-market? And when you talk about a focus on prospecting and deal management, is this more of a consolidation play? Or is this more of a greenfield and replacing manual efforts.\nYamini Rangan: Derrick, I like that. It's all of those. I think in the market that we see, it's certainly, there are customers who've gone through the route of point solutions and they want to be able to consolidate on a single platform to get better visibility. And the fact that we not only have a market-leading sales solution, but it is tightly integrated with a market-leading, marketing solution plays well within the segments that we serve. And so it's point solution consolidation.  The other part of it is that when we look at the environment right now, it is one where people are looking to optimize their spend while improving productivity. And our sales solution does exactly that. We've been able to integrate it obviously deeply with marketing, but also make prospecting deal management, forecasting much more sophisticated over the past few quarters, and it resonates. And there's pretty clear momentum in terms of Sales Hub. And in fact, Sales Hub as a percentage of 3-plus hubs jumped from 49% last year to 56% this year. So clear momentum based on the leadership that we have within the market.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.\nKeith Weiss: Excellent. Congratulations on a really nice quarter and a difficult environment. I wanted to ask a 2-parter a lot of new functionality and new product announced at the user conference earlier back in September. And one of the things you guys talked about was the ability for that to pull people up to sort of higher level SKUs and whatnot, particularly the AI functionality. So part one, have you seen any of that start to impact numbers as of yet or perhaps on average pricing as of yet.  Part two, behind all that product, is there going to be increased investment in distribution or marketing or whatnot? One of the highlights of the past year has definitely been the margin expansion this quarter, 700 basis points year-on-year was definitely above expectations. Is that durable on a go-forward basis? Or should we be expecting more investment behind all this innovation?\nYamini Rangan: I'll maybe get started on the 2-part question. On the first part, our overall product and pricing philosophy stays the same. From a product perspective, our philosophy is to deliver powerful tools that are just easy to use. And everything that we announced at INBOUND, and we continue to innovate on consistently drives both power and ease of use. Specifically on AI, as I mentioned a little bit earlier, Keith, we're still in the march towards getting a lot of the features from data to general availability. And so we've not yet seen that impact pricing, and that will be what we'll continue to focus on in terms of driving usage and adoption as we go into next year.  So you will hear more about AI pricing in early Q1 and then we'll talk about the trends that you're seeing on the impact to ASP next year on that. But the strategy that you articulated is exactly the case. And then in terms of how we think about scale and distribution and how we're looking at investments, look, we do have a great moat. And the moat that we have in distribution is our ability to scale product led, sales led and partner driven.  And we want to do it in a way where they get efficient over time. And Kate articulated a number of areas at the Analyst Day. And as we look at the next few years, we want to balance growth and profitability. And -- the biggest area in terms of profitability is sales and marketing efficiency. And so we'll continue to make investments. So we increase our distribution moat, but we do it in an efficient manner.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo.\nMichael Turrin: I want to go back to the second part of the last one and just ask Kate on margin. You've shown more meaningful expansion this year in this quarter, even with INBOUND we're seeing a bit more uptick. It also looks like head count adds are coming back, albeit at a modest pace. So can you just walk us through the trade-offs you're evaluating going forward as we're still in this what sounds like elongated macro. And what leads you to kind of turn those dials between adding heads and investing into the product side and pushing more margin if growth remains more challenged?\nKathryn Bueker: Yes. Thank you very much for the question. We do continue to strive for a real balance in growth and profitability. A lot of the profitability that we are delivering this year is a result of the fact that we pulled back pretty dramatically on hiring in the back half of last year. We did a risk at the beginning of this year, and we've been very focused and targeted on where we're adding investment. The first place we're going to continue to add investment is in product and engineering to continue to drive innovation.  And you're seeing that translate into product introduction and over time, long term and sustainable growth. We're going to continue to invest in the go-to-market to make sure that we have the capacity to service the demand that we are seeing, and we're going to continue to invest in internal product -- internal systems, automation and AI to drive some of these continued efficiency over the next 3 to 5 years as we talked about at Analyst Day.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Josh Riley with Needham & Company.\nRobert Morelli: This is Rob Morelli on for Josh. If you take a look at your tech customers compared to nontech, have you seen a greater calling in seats over this current cycle? Or has it been fairly broad. And if weakness in the broader economy continues to spread, is there a lag where non-tech customers need to take another cycle of cooling seats similar to the deeper cuts already taken by tech customers?\nKathryn Bueker: Yes. Thanks for the question. We talked in the past about the diversity of our customer base, and that just remains true. We have a very highly diversified customer base across industries software is our largest, which -- but remains sort of not mid- to high teens in terms of the percentage of ARR. And we have not seen any meaningful shift in the composition of our installed base ARR over time.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Michael Turits with KeyCorp.\nMichael Turits: So first, Kate, no guidance, obviously, for next year, but can you give us something around Clearbit in terms of -- is it kind of a low double-digit millions in terms of ARR contribution. Just something that give us some sense on whether there's any dilution there.  And then for Yamini, if I can add two parts. How do you balance that simplicity plus sophistication of the new products as you roll out such that you don't alienate the base and you appeal up market.\nKathryn Bueker: Yes, I'll start and I'm sorry to disappoint you, but we are -- our 1 week post signing of the acquisition of Clearbit. We have not yet closed. We are expecting that we will close by the end of this year, but that obviously means that we will own Clearbit for a very short period in 2023. And so not surprisingly, de minimis contribution in terms of revenue or any margin impact. In terms of 2024, like we'll be more explicit with some financial targets or implications of the acquisition once we've closed it, likely on our call in Q4.\nYamini Rangan: Yes. In terms of the second part of your question on how we balance the power and ease, we just have to do it carefully. And we have conversations with our products and UX leaders and they always are like, \"Hey, you really want us to have a consumer-like feel at the lower end for SMB, but you want a sophistication of really amazing products at the top end\". And the answer is yes. We want you to do that. So that is a feature, not a bug in terms of what we're asking you to do.  And so what has happened as we have implemented our bimodal strategy is we understand that in order for someone to get started very early in their digital journey. It just needs to be super simple, very intuitive take 60 minutes to set up a website, take 60 minutes to open up and unbox CRM and get going on it, and we want that experience. In fact, we'll keep improving that experience. And that actually plays a lot as we continue to build sophisticated features.  And internally, we talk about opinionated customization. So a lot of software typically ends up becoming unwieldy because the customization takes over. And internally, we really talk about opinionated customization and how do you deliver something that is simple, opinionated but really, really powerful. And that's super intentional. Huge kudos to our product and UX organization. And Dharmesh, feel free to add.\nDharmesh Shah: Yes, one thing to add here is that the -- one thing that we're most proud of is that we didn't wake up a month or a go. So it wouldn't it be nice to have an easy-to-use product. We've had 17 years of conviction around SMB. We deliberately chose it, and we've been working for those 17 years to kind of maintain that ease of use even as we add more power to the top end. And this is where the bimodal strategy really shows up. So this is not an optional thing, right? It was like, \"oh, it would be nice to have an easy-to-use product\". We kind of force our hand and we kind of make ourselves have that discipline because if we could not keep that ease of use there, the bimodal strategy just would not work. So it's 17 years of effort by the product team to continue to drive that ease-of-use while continuing to kind of specification on the top end. I'm super proud of the team.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Tyler Radke with Citigroup.\nTyler Radke: I'm curious on the upmarket and enterprise momentum that you're seeing. If you could just kind of comment on what you're seeing for Q4, especially as it relates to some large renewals that you're seeing at an incumbent. Are you seeing similar sales cycle issues and challenges and expansion. But if you could just kind of compare and contrast what you're seeing up market relative to your core customer base.\nYamini Rangan: Tyler, I think it's a good question. In terms of upmarket, the customer trends are very consistent with what we have broadly said, which is when I look at the pipeline, we look at upmarket customers, there's a lot of engagement, there's a lot of interest, especially as customers are looking to consolidate on fewer platforms and optimize their spend. We come into the picture, the thing is it does take a few more conversations, few more demos, few more decision-makers in order for them to get approval.  But maybe more broadly, if I step back and think about our upmarket momentum, we've been focused on upmarket for more than a few quarters, both from a product as well as from a go-to-market perspective. our product has gotten much better, and it's meeting the needs of upmarket customers with more customization, more admin features. In fact, there's even more that's coming up that helps our product be easy and powerful. That's a differentiator. The perception of market has also clearly improved. We are gaining momentum, not just within the marketing organization, but other parts of the organization and our ability to co-sell with partners and deliver value to customers upmarket is also great. So there is momentum both on the product side as well as customer driven, but we continue to see a very similar trend up market as we have seen in the bulk of HubSpot customer track.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of David Hynes with Canaccord.\nDavid Hynes: Maybe another one on Clearbit. The pricing appears to be volume-based. There's not a ton of color on their website. Can you give us a sense for like a range of potential spend that your average customer might generate if they were to adopt Clearbit? And I guess, like, is that current pricing convention, how you plan to fold it into HubSpot? Any color there would be interesting.\nYamini Rangan: Yes. Thank you. This is Yamini. I'll start. Well, the deal still needs to go through the regulatory approval process. It can take a few weeks or longer. So between now and closing, we're not digging that deep there, nothing changes. Once it closes, you can expect a couple of integration phases where we'll share a lot more about the pricing strategy. But the initial phases, we'll look to get Clearbit data into our customer base. And Clearbit is already in our app market. They already have an integration with HubSpot. They've already been working with our customers.  So I think it will naturally continue with what they currently have. And then medium term to longer term will more seamlessly integrate their data into HubSpot's products and use cases. And again, our vision is really how do we accelerate our customer platform with this data. And so we'll be very thoughtful and both in terms of pricing strategy, but also go-to-market. And we'll share a lot more once the deal has closed.\nCharles MacGlashing: Thanks, Yamini. I think we've got time for maybe one more question. I know we have a bunch of people in the queue, but time for one more.\nOperator: Absolutely. The last question is from the line of Ryan MacWilliams with Barclays.\nRyan MacWilliams: Just on your contract duration, are you seeing any customers at this point just from 1 year to monthly contracts? Just asking about the gap between the constant currency revenue growth and the constant currency billings growth? And then are you also seeing any differences in growth contribution from your direct sales force compared to your channel ecosystem this quarter versus the quarter prior.\nKathryn Bueker: Yes. Thanks for the question. We have been talking about duration for a number of quarters now as we talk about billings. And what we're seeing this quarter, what we saw in Q3 is very consistent with what we have been seeing for quite a bit of time now, which is a slight reduction in overall billing duration of the customer base. So nothing new there In terms of -- I'll just -- I'll it close out in terms of the partner versus direct contribution, again, very similar. Partners continue to represent in and around 40% of the contribution to the business. They are an important channel for us and will continue to be so.\nOperator: There are no additional questions left at this time. I will now hand it back to Yamini for closing remarks.\nYamini Rangan: Thanks, everyone. I really appreciate all the effort by our employee partners, and thank you for your support. We'll speak to you all in the New Year.\nOperator: That concludes today's conference call. Thank you. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Dharmesh Shah",
            "content": "Yes. And I just want to clarify, we talked about net revenue retention being up slightly sequentially, not Net New ARR. So I just want to make sure that we're clear on that. Thank you. Thanks for the question, Brian. So we're really thrilled with the kind of adoption of HubSpot AI after its launch at INBOUND. And we're particularly pleased with the repeat usage we're getting out of some of the marketing oriented use cases. And as Yamini mentioned in the opening comments, one thing we've learned is that if you can put these AI features right where people do their work, it works. And so we're continuing to double down on that. AI is the -- literally the #1 priority on the HubSpot product road map going into 2024. We're super excited. And one thing we're going to do is take the lessons from the adoption that we've seen so far, and we're taking a ChatSpot, and we're going to kind of leave it through the entire platform. So we have a natural language interface and kind of add the Smart and Smart CRM within HubSpot. So that's kind of high on the list.  In terms of OpenAI in their recent conference they had just 2 days ago on Monday. Super exciting things. Here are things that are most relevant that has -- and we've been working with them on preview releases of what just got announced. The #1 thing is they launched a new version of their model called GPT-4 Turbo, which is as the name implies, is faster. But the thing that's much more exciting about it is that they expanded the context window. And without getting too geeky, the context window defines how much data you can pass, how much information when you prompt the LLM when you ask a question. And they went from 8,000 tokens, which was a default before to 128,000 tokens. And to put that in context, that's equivalent of a 300-page book.  Now here's why that's important for HubSpot. When we're generating, let's say, a sales e-mail that says, \"Oh, we want to do an upgrade sales to this particular customer\", now we can take all the information that's in the HubSpot Smart CRM on this unified data record and take all that context and pass it to the LLM in real time so that when it crafts that message, it does the best job possible.  What has me even more excited, so it's not just the CRM data that we have now, imagine in the future, we have Clearbit data, where we have all this information, all these 200 attributes, all this intent data, we can bring that all together into one single kind of prompt to the LLM and it can take all that information in real time and craft these really, really pointed effective messages. So super exciting going into 2024.  And then one for Kate here is that one thing they did announce is that the cost for all this kind of invocation of their latest model is going down. Our estimates are somewhere around 50% to 70% based on our usage once this goes into GA. So lots to be excited about AI is massively exciting going into 2024. Thanks for the question. Yes, one thing to add here is that the -- one thing that we're most proud of is that we didn't wake up a month or a go. So it wouldn't it be nice to have an easy-to-use product. We've had 17 years of conviction around SMB. We deliberately chose it, and we've been working for those 17 years to kind of maintain that ease of use even as we add more power to the top end. And this is where the bimodal strategy really shows up. So this is not an optional thing, right? It was like, \"oh, it would be nice to have an easy-to-use product\". We kind of force our hand and we kind of make ourselves have that discipline because if we could not keep that ease of use there, the bimodal strategy just would not work. So it's 17 years of effort by the product team to continue to drive that ease-of-use while continuing to kind of specification on the top end. I'm super proud of the team."

            "name": "Kathryn Bueker",
            "content": "Thanks, Yamini. Let's turn to our third quarter 2023 financial results. Revenue grew 24% year-over-year in constant currency and 26% on an as-reported basis. Subscription revenue grew 25% year-over-year while services and other revenue increased 31% on an as-reported basis. Domestic revenue grew 22% year-over-year, international revenue growth was 26% in constant currency and 30% as reported, now representing 47% of total revenue.  We added 9,100 net new customers in the quarter, bringing our total customer count to over 194,000, up 22% year-over-year. Average subscription revenue per customer grew 1% year-over-year in constant currency and 3% on an as-reported basis to $11,500. Our ASRPC growth was driven by continued multi-hub adoption by our professional and enterprise customers, offset by the large volume of starter customers we added at the low end of our bimodal strategy over the last few quarters. Gross retention remained healthy in the high 80s for the quarter, and net revenue retention was up slightly quarter-over-quarter.  We continue to see pressure on net upgrade motions, including seats, contact tiers, additions and portals and expect this to persist in the short term. Nevertheless, we remain confident that we can maintain net revenue retention above 100%. Calculated billings were $550 million, growing 20% year-over-year in constant currency and 24% as reported. The remainder of my comments will refer to non-GAAP measures. Operating margin was 16%, up 7 points compared to the year ago period. Operating margin in the quarter benefited from lower T&E and other discretionary spend, continued infrastructure optimization and more concentrated hiring in Q3 and Q4 in key areas such as product innovation, AI and internal systems and data. Net income was $83 million or $1.59 per fully diluted share.  Free cash flow was $65 million or 12% of revenue, and our cash and marketable securities totaled $1.7 billion at the end of September. On October 31, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Clearbit for approximately $150 million in cash. The acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approval and we expect the transaction to close before the end of the year.  Like Yamini, I am excited about the value we can create for our customers with the combination of Clearbit's world-class data and HubSpot's AI-powered customer platform, and I look forward to welcoming the Clearbit team to HubSpot.  Okay. Before we dive into guidance, I wanted to touch quickly on the macro environment. As Yamini indicated, we continue to operate in a challenging environment. Q3 felt similar to what we saw in the first half of the year. Budgets are still under scrutiny deals are taking longer to close, buying urgency is low and customers are continuing to look for ways to optimize their spend. Our guidance assumes that these weak conditions persist in Q4.  Now let's review our guidance for the fourth quarter and full year of 2023. For the fourth quarter, total as reported revenue is expected to be in the range of $556 million to $558 million, up 19% year-over-year at the midpoint. We expect foreign exchange to be a 2-point tailwind to as reported revenue growth in the quarter. Non-GAAP operating profit is expected to be between $85 million and $86 million. Non-GAAP diluted net income per share is expected to be between $1.53 and $1.55. This assumes 52.7 million fully diluted shares outstanding. And for the full year of 2023, total as reported revenue is now expected to be in the range of $2.144 billion to $2.146 billion, up 24% year-over-year at the midpoint. We now expect foreign exchange to have no material impact on as reported revenue growth for the full year.  Non-GAAP operating profit is now expected to be between $317 million and $318 million. Non-GAAP diluted net income per share is now expected to be between $5.66 and $5.68. This assumes 52.2 million fully diluted shares outstanding. As you adjust your models, keep in mind the following: we continue to expect CapEx as a percentage of revenue to be roughly 5% and now expect free cash flow to be about $275 million for the full year of 2023. Looking forward to 2024, we expect foreign exchange to be a 1- to 2-point headwind to as reported revenue growth.  And with that, I will hand things back over to Yamini for her closing remarks. Yes. Sure thing. Thanks, Samad. You rightly indicated, Net New ARR was up slightly in Q3. The drivers of net revenue retention were very much the same ones that we talked about at Analyst Day and frankly, that we've been talking about for the last sort of 4 to 6 quarters here. The highlight continues to be customer dollar retention. Customer dollar retention is holding nicely in the high 80s. We typically see a little seasonal step-up in customer dollar retention in Q3. We did see that again this year.  The downside here is that we continue to see a challenge in this net upgrade motion, and it's both on more downgrades. So more customers continuing to optimize their spend with HubSpot and also less volume of customers upgrading. And it's all the same motion that we talked about at Analyst Day. On the downgrade side, it is the consumption-based motions of seats and contact as well as additions. And it is fewer customers adding seats and contact tiers.  Nothing to report in terms of a change in the net revenue retention trajectory in Q4. As I said at Analyst Day and I'd reiterate here, in order for us to really see that in flex we would really want to see the external environment improve, which we think is first going to show up in downgrade pressure lessening and then we would see a follow-on effect of more customers starting to add the -- starting to add contact tiers. So it's largely a function of the external environment turning around. Maybe I'll start and talk through a bit of the -- how do we think about the economic environment in setting guidance. Certainly, Yamini and I said this in the prepared remarks, it continues to be a very challenging external environment. We believe that, that environment will continue to be challenging through the end of this year. It's frankly a little too early to talk about next year. We will give, as you know, formal guidance on our Q4 call.  In February, what you should have heard Yamini say is really like we have very clear focus areas. We're focused on productization, we're focused on AI. We're executing really well. And we feel really good about how that sets us up when the economy does turn. That's the expectation is that things remain challenging, at least through early next year. Yes, maybe I will start. Brad, thank you very much. We were very happy with the level of new customer additions for the quarter. You are also right, the increase in the new customer additions quarter-over-quarter is very much driven by the Starter addition. You heard Yamini talk about the bimodal strategy as being one of the things that's really working for us. And as we talked about at Analyst Day, the goal of the low end of the bimodal strategy is really to maximize the volume of customers that we can bring on to the platform. And so as a result, we are constantly running experiments to try to drive volume into our Starter tier. We certainly watch the characteristics of those cohorts to make sure that we feel really good about their ability to retain an upgrade.  This quarter was no different. There were a number of experiments that we ran across pricing and packaging as well as a number of plays that we ran to really lean into activation and conversion of free users into starter customers. So we're feeling really good about it. Thanks for the question. I think that it is very purposeful. So we have -- you've heard us talk about the fact that when we entered the early stages of the pandemic, we made a change from a pricing and packaging perspective to really dramatically lower the price point for Starter. And we were frankly surprised at how sensitive to that pricing potential customers work. And so we have taken that learning and really leaned into it through what we've been referring to as the bimodal strategy, but we are getting better and better at running experiments at that low end to drive volume, and we feel good about our ability to continue to deliver that customer adds, call it at the high end of that 7,000 to 8,000 range that we've been talking about for the last couple of quarters. Yes. Thank you very much for the question. We do continue to strive for a real balance in growth and profitability. A lot of the profitability that we are delivering this year is a result of the fact that we pulled back pretty dramatically on hiring in the back half of last year. We did a risk at the beginning of this year, and we've been very focused and targeted on where we're adding investment. The first place we're going to continue to add investment is in product and engineering to continue to drive innovation.  And you're seeing that translate into product introduction and over time, long term and sustainable growth. We're going to continue to invest in the go-to-market to make sure that we have the capacity to service the demand that we are seeing, and we're going to continue to invest in internal product -- internal systems, automation and AI to drive some of these continued efficiency over the next 3 to 5 years as we talked about at Analyst Day. Yes. Thanks for the question. We talked in the past about the diversity of our customer base, and that just remains true. We have a very highly diversified customer base across industries software is our largest, which -- but remains sort of not mid- to high teens in terms of the percentage of ARR. And we have not seen any meaningful shift in the composition of our installed base ARR over time. Yes, I'll start and I'm sorry to disappoint you, but we are -- our 1 week post signing of the acquisition of Clearbit. We have not yet closed. We are expecting that we will close by the end of this year, but that obviously means that we will own Clearbit for a very short period in 2023. And so not surprisingly, de minimis contribution in terms of revenue or any margin impact. In terms of 2024, like we'll be more explicit with some financial targets or implications of the acquisition once we've closed it, likely on our call in Q4. Yes. Thanks for the question. We have been talking about duration for a number of quarters now as we talk about billings. And what we're seeing this quarter, what we saw in Q3 is very consistent with what we have been seeing for quite a bit of time now, which is a slight reduction in overall billing duration of the customer base. So nothing new there In terms of -- I'll just -- I'll it close out in terms of the partner versus direct contribution, again, very similar. Partners continue to represent in and around 40% of the contribution to the business. They are an important channel for us and will continue to be so."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Yamini Rangan",
            "content": "Thank you, Chuck, and welcome to everyone joining us on the call. Let me start with our performance in the quarter, share my observations on the macro environment and wrap up with our vision for our customer platform powered by AI and data.  Let's jump into our Q3 results. We had another quarter of solid execution with revenue growing 24% year-over-year in constant currency. We delivered another exceptional quarter of operating margin growth with 700 basis points of margin expansion year-over-year, driving our operating margin to 16%. Total customers grew by 22% year-over-year to over 194,000 customers globally, driven by over 9,100 net customer additions in the quarter. I'm pleased with our team's focused execution and the progress we are making to become the #1 customer platform for scaling companies.  Our Q3 results highlight two consistent themes this year. Our bimodal go-to-market strategy is working, and our product innovation is in high gear, especially coming out of inbound in September. In the lower end of our segments, we saw strength in net customer additions driven by free sign-ups and growth optimization plays in our starter addition. Our value proposition of an easy-to-use, easy-to-scale customer platform resonates within the segment.  In upmarket, we continue to see multi-hub adoption as customers consolidate on fewer platforms and drive better visibility across marketing, sales and service. A great example of a multi-hub customer who's seeing results from consolidating on HubSpot is Knowledge Academy. They are the largest provider of online instructor-led training globally. They started with Sales Hub to get better visibility into their pipeline and then added Marketing Hub to optimize their marketing budget and also added Service Hub to get a complete view of their customers.  Since implementing HubSpot, Knowledge Academy has grown leads by 4x, boosted sales by nearly 2x and increased their average order value by 25%. As you've heard me say before, our hubs are powerful on their own, but the real value for our customers comes from using them together. And we can see this in our results with over 50% of our installed base now on three or more hubs.  Turning to product innovation. We continue to be in high gear, and our launches at INBOUND are driving momentum. While we have launched over 200 new product enhancements this year, the two big moments at inbound, where the Sales Hub relaunched and HubSpot AI launch. So why did we relaunch Sales Hub and we are already seeing momentum within this hub this year? Simple. We want to deliver the best prospecting and deal management solutions that are deeply connected especially for our upmarket customers.  The new prospecting workspace, which is now generally available, gives reps one place to organize their leads and pass so that they can spend less time looking for information and more time connecting with customers. In deal management, we introduced AI-powered forecasting to help sales leaders improve accuracy in revenue projections, very important in any environment. We have a compelling vision to drive sales productivity, and we are hearing positive feedback from our customers, particularly in upmarket about the new found power and sophistication of Sales Hub.  Another highlight that inbound was the launch of HubSpot AI. We believe that every scaling organization deserves an AI-powered customer platform. And that is why we are deeply embedding AI across all of our hubs and our entire platform. We announced a number of features across AI assistance, AI agents, AI insights and ChatSpot. While I'm certainly excited about our pace of innovation, what we are really focused on is driving usage and value for customers. 40% of enterprise customers have already used HubSpot AI features, along with 20% of pro customers. About 2/3 of AI users are leveraging AI assistance to craft marketing e-mails and blogs. Social publishing is proving out to be a sticky use case, drawing in engaged users. In short, when we embed AI into the flow of work it works. I'm pleased to see usage beginning to grow, and we know we're still in the early stages of a major technology shift.  Looking ahead, we're focused on driving discoverability of and differentiation with AI features. We will drive adoption both in product and via customer education. We will drive differentiation by bringing more sophisticated use cases that are more deeply connected with HubSpot data. To summarize, I like the early adoption trends. and our well-defined AI road map to bring innovation to our customers.  Okay. Let's shift gears and talk about what we're seeing in the macro environment. Overall, we continue to operate in a choppy and challenging environment. Sales cycles remain lumpy, budgets are still under scrutiny and buying urgency remains low. It is clear based on my conversations with customers that they still need approvals from multiple decision makers and are continuing to optimize spend. Despite these headwinds, HubSpot's connected value proposition continues to resonate with customers looking to optimize spend and boost productivity. As we look ahead, we will continue to navigate this macro environment by following our playbook to drive product innovation and consistent strong execution.  Now I want to dive deep into our vision for our customer platform and talk about how our recently signed agreement to acquire Clearbit accelerates that vision. Our vision is to give millions of companies the best possible data about their customers in HubSpot. Today, we pull in data from website visits, marketing e-mails, sales calls, support tickets and more. And we unify all of that data on a beautiful, simple customer record. This is arguably the biggest advantage with HubSpot. With Clearbit, we will be able to bring in even more external data that can help our customers connect better with their end customers. So what can we solve for our customers with more unified data.  While we can help our customers identify great fit customers and provide clear signals on buying intent, both keys to increasing their go-to-market effectiveness. Our customers want company data, not just the name of the company and employee count, but they want rich attributes about companies including demographic data, like who is the CIO and techno-graphic data like which automation products are they using? In addition, they want a real-time way to monitor buying intent. Not just based on direct engagements within HubSpot platform but also based on customers' activities outside of HubSpot and around the web.  This is exactly what Clearbit is good at. They have 100-plus attributes for more than 20 million companies from more than 250-plus public and private data sources. We can take all of those data from HubSpot and Clearbit to power generative AI tools to create even more personal messages and insights for customers. Our differentiation will be to bring together a unified customer data with powerful AI tools that can consume that data and our market-leading engagement hub to supercharge our customers' go-to-market efforts.  Finally, why Clearbit? And what are our plans going forward? Clearbit has world-class data, and they share our commitment to helping customers grow. They also have a deep bench of B2B data experts with a bold mission to leverage AI to power insight. In all our conversations with Clearbit, it was clear that the team would be a great addition to our culture. And most importantly, this does not take away from our approach to building great products with cohesive user experiences. We use Clearbit data on our product today, and we have a very clear vision for how we can integrate their data to provide immediate value for our customers. In addition, we can leverage our product-led partner-led and sales-led distribution engines to get this into the hands of our customers post close. I'm thrilled by the prospect of acquiring Clearbit and our shared vision of solving for the customer. We will share more about our future plans after the deal has closed.  So reflecting on the quarter, we doubled down on product innovation in our core hubs and we established leadership in AI with our customers. Our teams are focused on consistent execution, and we have a clear vision for taking our customer platform to the next level with AI and data to deliver even more value to our customers.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Kate to take you through Q3 results in more detail. Kate? Thank you so much, Kate. I want to close by reiterating our commitment to balancing growth, profitability and a great culture to build an enduring company. We're driving rapid innovation with our customer platform and HubSpot AI to drive growth. We're focused on improving sales and marketing efficiency and scaling distribution. And on culture, we remain committed to building a high-performing, sustainable and diverse culture. This quarter, we hosted our first-ever Global Leadership Summit, which brought together our top leaders across the globe for workshops, trainings on performance, leadership and strategy. It was just a fantastic week and left me energized about HubSpot's future. A huge thank you to all our employees and partners for their dedication to driving results and to our customers and shareholders for their continued support on this journey.  With that, operator, let's please open up the call for questions. Arjun, yes, thanks for that question. Look, as both I said and Kate said, the environment continues to be choppy and challenging and customer urgency remains low. More broadly speaking, what we are seeing in second half as customer trends is very similar to what we saw in the first half of 2023. It's not gotten better and it's not gotten worse. And when we are looking at our pipeline and we have conversations with customers, we see more decision-makers involved in the process, more budget scrutiny, continued optimization of spend. Deals are definitely closing, but it takes more conversations, more demos and more time.  Now having said that, I think we've consistently executed in this type of a choppy and challenging environment. And when I look at the pipeline going into Q4, when I have conversations with customers, couple of things stand out. One is customers are focused on consolidating on fewer platforms to eliminate spend, this is exactly where HubSpot's value proposition really resonates, and we are helping consolidate point solutions for customers. And the second is they are focused on increasing productivity, especially because they're not increasing head count. And again, our quick time to value and the ease with which they can scale with our products is really helping.  So we are going to remain very laser-focused on executing in this environment, and we are assuming that this environment will continue into Q4 I don't think that changes our bimodal strategy. In fact, what has been good is that we have been consistently executing on a bimodal strategy to increase volume at the bottom and continue to deliver value at the top and we'll continue to drive product innovation to be able to win within this environment. Thank you, Mark. And I just love that you picked it up that you're clearly calling out that separation of the Smart CRM from Sales Hub, in particular, but just the hubs. And maybe explaining the strategy. So when we went into this year, we said that, one, we want to become absolute product and thought leaders in terms of our marketing hub, sales hub and service hub. And I credit this to Andy Pitre, our Head of Product, but he came in and he said, we're going to focus on two or three big use cases per hub. And specifically for Sales Hub, we picked prospecting and deal management. And these two are really important because prospecting obviously increases the productivity of sales reps and deal management with AI and forecasting improves the effectiveness of sales management and leaders. And so those were the two things. And at INBOUND, we relaunched Sales Hub we reinvented what prospecting and deal management look like, and that's gotten pretty significant traction.  So the other thing that we did is we separated out smart CRM from each of our engagement hubs. The reason is this, Smart CRM now, we've been investing in it for multiple quarters and it's now become a clear unified customer record that can be customized, that can be extended and where people can kind of bring information and continue to expand the use of HubSpot, and it's clearly different in value from the engagement hubs. And so we separated it out and I think partners love it. Customers now have even more clarity, and it's going to drive the overall adoption of the customer platform. Rishi, I'll take that multipart question. Maybe start with the vision and then the competitive landscape and then how we're thinking about privacy. Look, we're super excited about Clearbit and how they'll help us accelerate our vision for the customer platform. And what we're doing is we're bringing together this data and powerful AI tools that can consume that data and world-class engagement hubs, and that will help our customers connect and grow better.  And if we step back and think about the rationale for us, the age-old problem with CRM is that when you open up the box and set it up, it's empty. And our customers want us to pre-fill it with data on day 1. They want us to pre-fill it with company data, who else can they sell to, intent data, who else is looking to buy their products and services and contact data, who do we connect to. And this makes complete sense for our customers. And it solves a huge problem for them. And that's why Clearbit makes sense. Like I just mentioned in the prepared remarks, they have 20 million company profiles with rich attributes for each of these companies and makes absolute sense, especially in the world of AI.  And in terms of the competitive landscape, this is not about us entering a database. This is much more about us accelerating our customer platform vision. And vision that we have articulated is we want to have engagement hubs powered by a Smart CRM, powered by data, powered by AI that helps our customers grow. That's what we are accelerating. And the word platform really means we'll continue to operate in a very open ecosystem. And if our customers choose to work with Zoominfo and Apollo, we welcome that, and we'll continue to have a very open platform as well as ecosystem.  And I think in terms of the final part of your 3-part question, which is how do we think about data privacy. Look, we know our customers value having trust in our security privacy practices. And our level of commitment to security, privacy and governance will not change as we look at integrating the data asset. When it came to e-mail deliverability, we took the right side of the road in terms of how to help our customers deliver e-mails, but do it in a very thoughtful manner, and that's the same way in which we will look at this as we go into accelerating our vision. Overall, super excited. I have to say that the feedback from customers and partners has been really, really positive in the last week. And I think on the last part of your question from an AI monetization perspective, really no change from what we walked you all through at Analyst Day. We're really focused on delivering that road map, most of the features that we announced at INBOUND are either generally available now or getting close to general availability by early Q1, and that's when we'll share even more specifics about AI, but overall consistent with what we shared with you at the Analyst Day. And maybe the point to add here is that the success that we see is a testament to us becoming a platform of choice for SMBs. Part of the strategy is to get companies started early in their digital journey with us, continue to deliver value as they scale. And so that clear strategy and value proposition of making it easy to buy and easy to use and easy to scale, that is what resonates. And so we're pleased with it. And I think we'll continue with that bimodal strategy into next year. Derrick, I like that. It's all of those. I think in the market that we see, it's certainly, there are customers who've gone through the route of point solutions and they want to be able to consolidate on a single platform to get better visibility. And the fact that we not only have a market-leading sales solution, but it is tightly integrated with a market-leading, marketing solution plays well within the segments that we serve. And so it's point solution consolidation.  The other part of it is that when we look at the environment right now, it is one where people are looking to optimize their spend while improving productivity. And our sales solution does exactly that. We've been able to integrate it obviously deeply with marketing, but also make prospecting deal management, forecasting much more sophisticated over the past few quarters, and it resonates. And there's pretty clear momentum in terms of Sales Hub. And in fact, Sales Hub as a percentage of 3-plus hubs jumped from 49% last year to 56% this year. So clear momentum based on the leadership that we have within the market. I'll maybe get started on the 2-part question. On the first part, our overall product and pricing philosophy stays the same. From a product perspective, our philosophy is to deliver powerful tools that are just easy to use. And everything that we announced at INBOUND, and we continue to innovate on consistently drives both power and ease of use. Specifically on AI, as I mentioned a little bit earlier, Keith, we're still in the march towards getting a lot of the features from data to general availability. And so we've not yet seen that impact pricing, and that will be what we'll continue to focus on in terms of driving usage and adoption as we go into next year.  So you will hear more about AI pricing in early Q1 and then we'll talk about the trends that you're seeing on the impact to ASP next year on that. But the strategy that you articulated is exactly the case. And then in terms of how we think about scale and distribution and how we're looking at investments, look, we do have a great moat. And the moat that we have in distribution is our ability to scale product led, sales led and partner driven.  And we want to do it in a way where they get efficient over time. And Kate articulated a number of areas at the Analyst Day. And as we look at the next few years, we want to balance growth and profitability. And -- the biggest area in terms of profitability is sales and marketing efficiency. And so we'll continue to make investments. So we increase our distribution moat, but we do it in an efficient manner. Yes. In terms of the second part of your question on how we balance the power and ease, we just have to do it carefully. And we have conversations with our products and UX leaders and they always are like, \"Hey, you really want us to have a consumer-like feel at the lower end for SMB, but you want a sophistication of really amazing products at the top end\". And the answer is yes. We want you to do that. So that is a feature, not a bug in terms of what we're asking you to do.  And so what has happened as we have implemented our bimodal strategy is we understand that in order for someone to get started very early in their digital journey. It just needs to be super simple, very intuitive take 60 minutes to set up a website, take 60 minutes to open up and unbox CRM and get going on it, and we want that experience. In fact, we'll keep improving that experience. And that actually plays a lot as we continue to build sophisticated features.  And internally, we talk about opinionated customization. So a lot of software typically ends up becoming unwieldy because the customization takes over. And internally, we really talk about opinionated customization and how do you deliver something that is simple, opinionated but really, really powerful. And that's super intentional. Huge kudos to our product and UX organization. And Dharmesh, feel free to add. Tyler, I think it's a good question. In terms of upmarket, the customer trends are very consistent with what we have broadly said, which is when I look at the pipeline, we look at upmarket customers, there's a lot of engagement, there's a lot of interest, especially as customers are looking to consolidate on fewer platforms and optimize their spend. We come into the picture, the thing is it does take a few more conversations, few more demos, few more decision-makers in order for them to get approval.  But maybe more broadly, if I step back and think about our upmarket momentum, we've been focused on upmarket for more than a few quarters, both from a product as well as from a go-to-market perspective. our product has gotten much better, and it's meeting the needs of upmarket customers with more customization, more admin features. In fact, there's even more that's coming up that helps our product be easy and powerful. That's a differentiator. The perception of market has also clearly improved. We are gaining momentum, not just within the marketing organization, but other parts of the organization and our ability to co-sell with partners and deliver value to customers upmarket is also great. So there is momentum both on the product side as well as customer driven, but we continue to see a very similar trend up market as we have seen in the bulk of HubSpot customer track. Yes. Thank you. This is Yamini. I'll start. Well, the deal still needs to go through the regulatory approval process. It can take a few weeks or longer. So between now and closing, we're not digging that deep there, nothing changes. Once it closes, you can expect a couple of integration phases where we'll share a lot more about the pricing strategy. But the initial phases, we'll look to get Clearbit data into our customer base. And Clearbit is already in our app market. They already have an integration with HubSpot. They've already been working with our customers.  So I think it will naturally continue with what they currently have. And then medium term to longer term will more seamlessly integrate their data into HubSpot's products and use cases. And again, our vision is really how do we accelerate our customer platform with this data. And so we'll be very thoughtful and both in terms of pricing strategy, but also go-to-market. And we'll share a lot more once the deal has closed. Thanks, everyone. I really appreciate all the effort by our employee partners, and thank you for your support. We'll speak to you all in the New Year."

Now, it\u2019s my pleasure to turn over the call to HubSpot\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, Yamini Rangan. Yamini?\nYamini Rangan: Thank you so much, Chuck, and welcome to everyone joining us on the call. Today, I want to highlight our continued momentum in Q2, reiterate our playbook for winning in this macro environment, and close with updates on our generative AI road map as well as insights based on customer usage. Let's jump into our Q2 results. Q2 was a solid quarter for HubSpot with revenue growing 26% year-over-year in constant currency. We delivered 700 basis points of margin expansion year-over-year, driving operating margin to 14%. We have talked about our strategy for balancing growth and profitability, and we are purposefully executing against this strategy. I'm really happy with the operating leverage we delivered while driving growth in the quarter. Total customers grew by 23% to over 184,000 globally, fueled by over 7,600 net customer additions in the quarter. I'm very pleased with the strong results in Q2. The consistent performance demonstrated by our team and the momentum we have in becoming the platform of choice for scaling companies. Q2 results were driven by two key themes; our ability to deliver product innovation for our customers and our ability to consistently execute our bimodal go-market strategy. As you have seen over the past two years, our bimodal strategy is working, our starter tier continues to fuel volume on the low end of the market, driven by product and pricing optimization. That said, the story in Q2 was about market momentum with continued growth in multi-hub as well as full suite adoption. We saw more new customers starting with multiple hubs, fueling larger deals. 1/ 3 of our Pro and Enterprise customers are now on 3 or more hubs, which is up by 4 points year-over-year. In addition, we continue to see Sales Hub pick up steam with larger customers. Our investment in upmarket functionality, like customization and extensibility and governance is paying off as we win bigger deals with Sales Hub. Service Hub also gained traction upmarket in this quarter with 12 of our 25 largest deals, including a Service Hub attach. Companies are looking to improve handoffs across their marketing, sales and service teams, and they want a clear schedule of customer insights. By connecting Sales Hub and Service Hub, support can lock tickets that the sales team can now see because there is 1 central contact record. That context helps sales team close deals and is just 1 example of why a connected front office platform is so powerful. Take MarineMax, a national boat retailer, for example, before HubSpot, their legacy CRM was causing a disjointed customer experience. They couldn't effectively valve leads from marketing to sales and because the CRM was difficult to use sales reps weren't adopting it. Since switching to HubSpot and adopting Marketing Hub, Sales Hub, Service Hub and Ops Hub, MarineMax has increased annual revenue by 113% and reduced their average sales response time from days to minutes. They now have a shared visibility across the entire customer journey, leading to a better and faster customer experience. I love hearing that our connected value proposition is resonating and that our product innovation is driving clear value for customers. Now, I want to shift gears to talk about the macro environment. Overall, customer buying trends remain steady. Budgets remain under scrutiny. Multiple stakeholders continue to be involved in decisions. And while buying trends have not improved, they have not gotten worse either. Customers are continuing to optimize their budgets, and we can see this optimization across seats, additions, contact tiers and portals. The board by [ph] has risen, but companies are continuing to invest in digital transformation and prioritized platform level decisions. This is where HubSpot shines. We have a proven playbook for driving growth with our product innovation and focused execution. On the product side, HubSpot continues to win by being extremely easy to use and extremely powerful under the head. Our product innovation is in high gear, and I want to highlight just a few developments from the quarter. With Marketing Hub, we doubled down on omnichannel by moving Instagram reels into public beta as marketers increasingly focused on short-form social video. We also introduced Event Visualizer to give customers even more insight into their audiences activity and get deeper analytics on customer behavior. With Service Hub, we introduced content Assistant into inbox, so that service teams can leverage gen AI to respond to customers faster across various channels. We're also enabling teams to summarize customer conversations with gen AI and move that functionality into private beta in Q2. Lastly, on our path to building a more customizable and extensible CRM, we released customized pipeline use, enabling our customers to edit their views based on currency and tags that are specific to their business. We also improved permissions and user management for custom objects. This has been a top request from our enterprise customers. Our pay for product innovation is just cranking and I'm very pleased with the progress we are making in becoming the platform of choice for scaling companies. On the go-to-market side, how we sell is why we've been. We've built a competitive moat with three go-to-market motions, product-driven, partner-driven, and direct sales-driven. Our customers tell us that the way our sales and customer success teams serve them sets us apart. They see a notable difference in our team's ability to move quickly to demo the value of HubSpot, articulate clear platform consolidation benefits, and lineup the best partners to deliver services. Today, over 40% of all newcomer ARR and existing customer expansion is co-sold and influenced by our partners, just awesome stuff. While the macro environment remains challenging, what we sell and how we sell continue to be unique differentiators for HubSpot to drive durable profitable growth. Lastly, let's shift gears to talk about everyone's favorite topic, generative AI. Last quarter, we talked about Gen AI, and it is a transformative shift for SMBs and what this means for marketing, sales and service. In short, we believe AI will not replace go-to-market teams, it will guide and assist them to drive better customer outcomes. Today, I want to provide an overview of how we're building an entire layer of AI assistance across our platform, how our customers are responding, and what our unique differentiators are with AI. We launched ChatSpot earlier this year, and it has quickly grown to 70,000 total users with 20,000 prompts ingested weekly. Our customers tell us that they like our weekly updates. They love how quickly we are innovating with new AI capabilities, and they're getting value from the breadth of actions ChatSpot is helping them take. Customers are using ChatSpot to prospects for good fit companies based on location, industry, recent news, and more. They're creating entire campaigns with SEO research, block title generation, and image generation, all from within ChatSpot. The easy chat interface combined with the power of HubSpot's platform have our customers eager for what's next with ChatSpot. We also launched Content Assistant earlier this year, and since moving it to public beta in June, adoption has grown by 10x, with 26% of our enterprise customers using it today. Customers are describing Content Assistant as a game-changer because they can quickly generate social copy, block content, prospecting e-mails, all based on insights without having to leave HubSpot. Content Assistant embeds Gen AI into our customers' natural workflow, helping them work faster and smarter, right where they are. As I look at our AI roadmap, we are ambitiously building AI into the entire CRM platform, so our customers can get even more value from our platform. We want to help scaling companies power their entire customer journey with AI, and we believe we can help them leverage AI better than other platforms for three reasons. First, data is the fuel for AI and HubSpot has unique data. While other platforms provide data on who your customers are, HubSpot has data on who your customers are, what they did across channels, what they bought. And when we bring together the power of large language models with deep contextual first-party data in HubSpot CRM, magic happens. Second, HubSpot is where work gets done in the front office. We own the workflows that scaling businesses use every day. We're beginning to see this play out with content assistant usage that I just mentioned. Finally, gen AI needs human intervention to work responsibly and we've always had a human centric approach to product innovation. We're committed to having strong customer feedback loop and implementing the feedback very quickly. We're well-positioned to become the AI leader for scaling companies, and we're moving fast. We are prioritizing AI use cases in our roadmap and without giving too much away, AI is going to be a major theme at our INBOUND conference in September. I'm really excited for you to learn a lot more about our AI strategy and roadmap at our upcoming conference. Reflecting on the quarter, I'm very pleased with how our teams are driving the pace of product innovation, focusing on iterating fast with AI, while executing on our bimodal strategy. This focus and alignment is what will continue to set us apart to drive full and profitable growth. With that, I'll turn the call over to Kate to take you through our Q2 financial results. Kate?\nKate Bueker: Thanks, Yamini. Let's turn to our second quarter 2023 financial results. Revenue grew 26% year-over-year in constant currency and 25% on an as-reported basis. Subscription revenue grew 26% year-over-year, while services and other revenue increased 23% on an as-reported basis. Domestic revenue grew 25% year-over-year, while international revenue growth was 29% in constant currency and 26% as reported. International revenue represented 47% of total revenue in Q2. We added over 7,600 net new customers in the quarter, bringing our total customer count to over 184,000, up 23% year-over-year. Average subscription revenue per customer grew 3% year-over-year in constant currency and 2% on an as-reported basis to $11,400. Our ASRPC growth was driven by continued multi-hub adoption by our professional and enterprise customers, offset by the large volume of starter customers we added at the low end of our bimodal strategy over the last few quarters. Gross retention remained healthy in the high 80s for the quarter. Net revenue retention was 103%, down one point sequentially, driven by continued spend optimization by our customers across seats, additions, contact tiers and portals. While we expect pressure on net revenue retention in the near-term to persist, we continue to see strong gross retention and believe we can maintain net revenue retention above 100%. Calculated billings were $542 million in the quarter, growing 22% year-over-year in constant currency and 25% as reported. The remainder of my comments will refer to non-GAAP measures. Operating margin was 14%, up seven points compared to the year ago period. On a year-over-year basis, operating margin benefited from the restructuring actions we took at the end of January as well as a seasonal shift in hiring into Q3 and Q4. While these factors have helped drive a step change in operating margin, we continue to invest in critical areas such as product innovation, AI and internal systems and data to ensure we're building the foundation for continued margin expansion as we scale. Net income was $70 million or $1.34 per fully diluted share. Free cash flow was $60 million or 11% of revenue, and our cash and marketable securities totaled $1.7 billion at the end of June. And with that, let's review our guidance for the third quarter and full year of 2023. As Yamini highlighted, we continue to operate in a difficult macro environment. Customer budgets remain tight decisions by committee or the norm and customers continue to look for ways to optimize existing spend. Our guidance assumes that these weak macroeconomic conditions persist throughout the second half of 2023. For the third quarter, total as reported revenue is expected to be in the range of $532 million to $534 million, up 20% year-over-year at the midpoint. We expect foreign exchange to be a 1- to 2-point tailwind to as reported revenue growth in the quarter. Non-GAAP operating profit is to be between $67 million and $69 million. Non-GAAP diluted net income per share is expected to be between $1.22 and $1.24. This assumes 52.6 million fully diluted shares outstanding. And for the full year of 2023, total as reported revenue is now expected to be in the range of $2.116 billion to $2.122 billion, up 22% year-over-year at the midpoint. We now expect foreign exchange to be a 0.5 point tailwind to as reported revenue growth. Non-GAAP operating profit is now expected to be between $293 million and $297 million. Non-GAAP diluted net income per share is now expected to be between $5.24 and $5.29. This assumes 52.3 million fully diluted shares outstanding. As you adjust your models, keep in mind the following: We expect CapEx as a percentage of revenue to be roughly 5% and free cash flow to be about $26 0 million for the full year of 2023. The with seasonally stronger free cash flow in Q4. And with that, I will hand things back over to Yamini for her closing remarks.\nYamini Rangan: Thank you so much, Kate. I want to close with our commitment to building a sustainable and equitable company. One of our goals as an organization is to build a company future generation will be proud of. making progress on our environmental, social and governance efforts is a critical part of that journey. We released our annual sustainability report in Q2, and I want to highlight a few key developments. On the environmental side, we submitted our targets for validation by the science-based targets initiative, joining over 5,000 companies committed to ambitious climate action. In our effort to build a more diverse and inclusive company, we reached 47% female representation company-wide, nearing gender parity. We launched a customer trust center for our customers so they can learn more about our security, privacy, compliance and governance practices. I'm really proud of the progress we are making to build a diverse and sustainable company. I want to thank our customers, our partners and our shareholders for the continued support of HubSpot. And a big thank you to all our employees who are executing with focus and solving our customers every day. I look forward to seeing many of you at our Analyst Day as part of our INBOUND 2023 event on September 6. With that, operator, let's open up the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question for today comes from Samad Samana from Jefferies. Your line is now open, please go ahead.\nSamad Samana: Hi, good evening and thanks for taking my question. Yamini, I wanted to ask a question for you. You've talked a lot more about upmarket traction, and you've mentioned deals that are 3,000 5, 000-plus in MRR, which is much bigger than the overall average. So, I was just maybe wondering if the momentum there has increased in recent months on the enterprise side? And if it has, can you seek to the causal factors -- how much of it is it the product enhancements that you just mentioned today versus conversations around AI and HubSpot having a single platform benefiting versus maybe stumbles like competitors does think about both the momentum of the traction and what's causing it if it's changing?\nYamini Rangan: Yes. Thank you, Samad, for that question. Definitely pleased with the continued momentum of market. And as you know, we look at our target market as the 1,000 to 2,000 employee segment with upmarket being the 200 to 2,000 employee segment. And look, we've had a lot of focus and investments going into upmarket segments, so we're gaining traction for a variety of reasons, including all of the ones that you just mentioned. But maybe just to give a little bit of color, I'll start with what we're seeing with upmarket customers. And there are a couple of customer trends that we see up market. First off, upmarket customers are consolidating on platforms. Over the last couple of years, they've bought a number of disparate systems, and this is the time that they're focused on eliminating costs, but also getting clear visibility across the entire customer journey and so that driving interest. I think the second thing is focus this year for upmarket customers has been on sales productivity. Headcount is constrained in this environment, but customers still need to hit their growth targets. So, they're leaning into equipping their sales reps with the right technology solution that needs to be successful, and we certainly see larger sales Hub-driven deals within our customer buying patterns. Now, having said that, upmarket has been a strategic priority across the company, both from a product and go-to-market side. Our product has gotten much better, and it's meeting the needs of upmarket customers and this has been a constant drumbeat across the past few quarters. And ultimately, a product is easy to use but very, very powerful under the hood, and that's a differentiator. I think the perception has also improved upmarket. We're gaining momentum with exact and scaling companies and we've always had like a great relationship with CMOs and the marketing organization, but now CEO, CFO, COOs, know and understand the value of HubSpot there as well. And then finally, I think both the product -- both the partner teams as well as the direct teams are really able to clearly communicate the value of HubSpot as well as drive cost savings for our customers and how we sell is also why we win. So, we're pleased with the progress of market, and I think all of those factors really play into it.\nSamad Samana: Very helpful. Thanks Yamini. See you at INBOUND in September.\nYamini Rangan: See you there.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Elizabeth Porter of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open, Please go ahead.\nElizabeth Porter: Great. Thank you very much for the question. I was hoping you could provide a little bit more color around the dynamics when you launch free products. Was there any pent-up demand in the beginning that could be waning and impacting the new user sign up, or how big of a funnel, do you have to still work through on converting those free sign-ups to paid customers? Thank you.\nKate Bueker: Thanks, Elizabeth. This is Kate. I will start and then others can join if they want. Look I think you're asking about the free sign-ups because you saw a sequential drop in our net customer additions. I will confirm that, that is very much a dynamic happening with starter, we did see a quarter-over-quarter decline in starter. The free products that you highlight are one of a number of things that we use to drive demand at low end of our bimodal strategy, we consistently look to move functionality down into our free and starter products. We consistently experiment in pricing and packaging. We're launching free tools on a regular basis. And so there is a normal ebb and flow to the free user base and ultimately, the net starter additions that you'll see from one quarter to the next.\nElizabeth Porter: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mark Murphy of JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nMark Murphy: Thank you very much, and congrats on the results. Yamini, at the last Analyst Day, I believe you and Kate had mentioned that Sales Hub had a cross through to $450 million in ARR, and it had done that with mid-50s growth at that time. And interestingly, I went back and looked at this; it was growing faster than Marketing Hub was when it was that size? And realizing that most companies never have that kind of a second act third act; can you explain what is it that is propelling Sales Hubs so rapidly? And whenever the economy does return to normalcy, do you think that, that can continue to carve out a stronger arc than what we saw historically with marketing cloud?\nYamini Rangan: Mark, that's a great insightful question. I think like this goes back to the fact that we are in the middle of a fairly big transformation at HubSpot, one that we've been talking about for many years. We've been on this journey to go from app to suite to platform. And when we go from app to suite and Sales Hub becomes a legitimate front door then it actually drives faster adoption within the installed base. So the second product and the third product, new ports product, they have the benefit of having the install base of the first product. And that's what you're beginning to see. I think that, again, maybe dissecting the customer trends from what we see internally. From the customer side, every leader that I talked to, they're looking at ways to eliminate cost but drive better results. And over the last couple of years, they bought a ton of point solutions, and they're either struggling to integrate those solutions or the cost of these solutions are prohibitive. And we are now being seen as a powerful, cost-effective platform within this environment, and that helps with Sales Hub momentum because if you are a Marketing Hub customer, then it makes a lot more sense to get Sales Hub or if you're looking at ways to drive cost savings than buying multiple hubs and kind of eliminating costs, while getting better customer insights is working. Having the other part of it is that one of our strategic priorities this year was to double down and focus on driving product leadership in marketing, Sales and Service Hub, and that's exactly what our product teams are focused on innovating, and that's what you're seeing play out Sales Hub because it's now a really legitimate front door to HubSpot and we've talked about the steady drumbeat of product releases that are aimed at expanding our market opportunity within Sales Hub and we're also driving our ability to serve more sophisticated use cases. And just this past quarter in Q2, we released sequences on mobile, driving more prospecting efficiency with reporting, better embedded pipeline metrics. All of these are just examples of functionality within our sales hub that drive up market momentum and things that our customers have been asking for. So, I'd go back to second, third hubs always have the benefit of the first one. And when customer needs meet with product innovation meet with go-to-market execution, then we begin to see the consistency of the results that we are seeing now.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Rishi Jaluria from RBC. Your line is now open, please go ahead.\nRishi Jaluria: Wonderful. Thank you so much Yamini and Kate. So, as we think about your continued momentum upmarket and going head-to-head with some of the larger competitors, one of the pieces of feedback we hear from customers is that there are certain enterprise-grade features and functionality that they don't quite yet have available natively in HubSpot. How do you think about using generative AI to speed up the development around a lot of those enterprise-grade features and be even more competitive against some of the kind of more traditionally up market, but also maybe legacy competitors? Thanks.\nYamini Rangan: Yes. Great question. I'll start, and Dharmesh, feel free to just chime in there on the development side as well. Look, I think our focus is really that 20 to 200 and then 200 to 2,000 customer base and you're absolutely right. I think the list of innovation and a list of things that we can continue to do to expand our share of that market is there, and that's exactly why this is our number one priority within the company. We want to increase that product depth and leadership within that market. And so there's a long list of innovation that we are -- we know we're working on and our product and pace of innovation within product has been pretty high over the past few quarters exactly for that reason, so we can meet the needs of the customers. I do think at the same time, they look at us as a way to get visibility across all of the products that are organically built while eliminating the cost, which is why you see us as a platform of choice for these enterprise companies. Now, Gen AI certainly has the potential to accelerate productivity, not just in front office functions, but also for engineering and certainly something that we are looking at, but it's pretty early days in terms of driving the pace of innovation even further. Dharmesh, feel free to add there.\nDharmesh Shah: Yeah. One thing I'll add is that generative AI, I think it opens up an entire like a generational opportunity. I've been in CRM software for 30 years now since pre-cloud. So we saw once we advance the Internet team kind of entire new industry around cloud-based CRM. I think we're going to see something similar with generative AI. And HubSpot's approach has always been democratize technology as it's coming up and our focus on SMB. So I think opportunity this opens up for HubSpot is to say, hey, we're tackling SMB, we want to do the same thing we did when we launched our CRM. We said, we want every company to be able to benefit from having a really good CRM. Now that we see generative AI features coming down the road, our philosophy is we want every company to benefit from an AI-powered CRM. So how do we take all these features that are now -- right now market leading, but how do we make them and disuse them and democratize them available. So I think it creates an opportunity for us to capture more mind share and market share within SMB, the market we're focused in, and it's a once-in-a-generation opportunity.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Peterson of Raymond James. Brian, your line is open. Please go ahead.\nBrian Peterson: Thanks for taking the question. So I wanted to maybe pivot off up market and focus on mid-market for a second. And I'd love to understand is the vendor consolidation trend that you're seeing. Is that narrative happening in the mid-market as well, or is there may be more of a spend rationalization here? I would love to maybe understand and get your perspective there. Thank you.\nYamini Rangan: Yeah, Brian, I think it's happening in mid-market as well. There is absolutely no doubt that we see it. And for us, mid-market is that to 20 to 200 person company. That's what we call as mid-market. And if you look at what is driving vendor consolidation across all of the segments that we are in, it's the last couple of years of how customers have grown. SMBs were thrown into the digital environment post the pandemic and during the pandemic, they went in and bought a number of point solutions and -- or they went and got some enterprise-class solutions. And both of those have proven to be pretty costly in terms of maintaining the tech stack, but also pretty brittle in terms of getting customer insights. And so if you look at a mid-market company, they are also in the same place of looking at eliminating costs while driving better customer insights and we see the same trend play out within mid-market. And again, we begin to see more multi-hub and even full suite pro and enterprise deals within the mid-market segment.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Zukin of Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nRyan Krieger: Hey, guys this is Ryan on for Alex. Thanks for taking the question. So just a quick one on retention. It seems like the deceleration in NRR is slowing. So if you look at NRR, some kind of a month-over-month basis, did it start to improve at all in the back half of the quarter, like, in June? And then how should we be thinking about when that metric could trough kind of going forward? Thanks.\nKate Bueker: Yeah. Thanks, Ryan, for the question. Net revenue retention, you're right on the quarterly math. For the quarter, net revenue retention was 103%, which was down 1%. I don't think we're going to comment on monthly trends here, but I will make a couple of comments on net revenue retention. The first, I guess, maybe I'll just start with the good news, which is our customer dollar retention, which we refer to as gross retention externally, remains steady in the high 80s, which provides a really nice foundation for us around net revenue retention overall. The area where we continue to see challenge is the same one we've been talking about for a number of quarters, which is on that net upgrade rate. So, kind of, going back to the back half of 2022, there was more consumption-driven motions like seats and contacts for us continue to be pressured. We're seeing that both on the downgrade side, but we're also seeing lower volume of customers adding contacts and seats in addition. And then finally, customers, you heard -- both Yamini and I talked about this in our prepared remarks, are really looking to optimize their spend across the board by sort of adjusting additions and consolidating their portals onto a single HubSpot instance, really looking for ways to maximize the ROI from our platform. Now, you asked a really hard question, which is like what is it going to turn? And I will admit is like really difficult to predict. Obviously, it's dependent at least in decent amount on macro pressure. What I will say is that we feel good about our ability to retain the customer dollar retention at that high 80s level, and we feel good about our ability to retain net revenue retention above 100.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brad Sills of Bank of America. Your line is now open, please go ahead.\nBrad Sills: Wonderful. Thank you. I wanted to ask a question on AI, a lot of exciting use cases. It sounds like already for -- in your customer base around ChatSpot AI and Content Assistant. How are you thinking about the monetization here? Are these -- is this baseline functionality that just needs to drive the moat? Do you think you might put some of this functionality into premium additions, maybe separate SKUs? Just any color on, on how you're thinking about the monetization opportunity for AI? thank you.\nYamini Rangan: Yes. Thanks a lot for that question, Brad. This is Yamini. We're very clearly excited about generative AI. It is a pretty big transformative shift. And I think we look at it as being well-positioned to serve the SMB market. And historically, if you've looked at HubSpot, we've done a really good job of taking powerful sophisticated technology and bringing it to bear within the SMB market. And this market is quite different from other kinds of segments because they typically don't have AI, ML experts and resources. And so we take our job pretty seriously to take powerful technology and democratize there. Now, specifically, on your question on monetization, we have a very clear first principle when it comes to monetization. And our principle is that we focus on delivering customer value first, and from there, monetization will follow. And we're going to apply that same first principle to AI. And when we think about this market, we're clearly in the early stages of iterating fast and adding value for customers. We're beginning to see that with both ChatSpot and Content Assistant in all of the use cases that we have in beta so far. Once we know what value we are adding to customers, then we'll follow a bimodal strategy to monetization. And what I mean by that is, on one hand, we'll likely democratize AI features and make it available in our freemium and starter tiers to drive adoption, you've seen that play out. We've taken really high-value features and added it to free and starter and that helped with adoption, but that also helps as an on-ramp to our other peers. And then the second part of what we'll likely do is drive higher value ASP with more specialized features. And this can certainly come in the form of adding certain features to higher additions like pro and enterprise. It can also come from packaging AI features into more specialized add-ons. So we're certainly thinking about all of that. But the first priority for us is move fast, iterate fast and add a ton of value for our customers specifically within the SMB segment. We want to be the AI leaders within the SMB segment and for scaling companies.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Gabriela Borges of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nGabriela Borges: Good afternoon. Thank you. Kate, I'm looking for a little bit of color on the constant currency billings deceleration that you saw this quarter. And I realize that you just talked about how difficult it is to predict the macro. So I'm hoping you could share a little bit on some of the leading indicators that you and the team look at to, try to get ahead of underwriting a turn in the macro and potentially to start ramping hiring again? Thank you.\nKate Bueker: Yeah. Thanks for the question. I'll try to give a little bit more color on the billings because I will admit it's a little bit of a head scratcher this quarter. As we -- what we try to ground ourselves on is constant currency revenue growth as a baseline assumption that constant currency revenue and constant currency billings will grow together. And this quarter, what you saw is a little bit more of a gap. And you saw this really unusual thing where you had constant currency billings growth dipping below as reported billings growth and I would just note, like billings has two components to it. It has revenue and it has a change in deferred revenue. And while currency was a headwind to revenue, it was actually a tailwind to deferred revenue, which is why there was this three-point tailwind to billings growth in the quarter. And if you just look at that FX impact, that's half gap between constant currency billings growth and constant currency revenue growth. Other than that, there's not -- the trends are largely the same as the ones that we've been talking about. We continue to see a little bit of a decline in duration as our mix shift away from marketing and into sales and service, shift away from new into installed base. But we expect those two growth rates to come back together in Q3 as we have a call it more normal FX comparison.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Josh Riley of Needham & Company. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nJosh Riley: Hi, there. Thanks for taking my question. If you look at the customer additions in the quarter, clearly, they're very strong at over 7,000 again. Can you just help us understand the price change on the starter bundle, how that impacts the trajectory of the net adds after a few months of the change being in the market? Is there an initial pop in demand and then it reverts or what's the cadence following these price changes? And was that a contributing factor to why the number was down sequentially? Thank you.\nKate Bueker: Yeah, I'll start. Net ads were down a bit from Q1 to Q2, but they were very much aligned with the expectations that we had internally and the expectations that we shared on the call last quarter. The other thing to note is they were much more balanced across addition than what we've seen over the last couple of quarters. In both Q4 and Q1, we were actually pretty surprised by the stronger performance in Starter that was really the driver of the overall new customer addition. So, yes, Starter did decline a little bit, but it is in line with our expectations, and we frankly would expect that it would sort of stay in and around these levels over the next couple of quarters.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Terry Tillman of Truist. Your line is now open, please go ahead.\nJoe Meares: Hey guys this is Joe Meares on for Terry. Appreciate you taking the question. Just curious, on the 3Q 2023 and 4Q 2023 implied revenue guide, it's looking like about 18% growth year-over-year ex-FX and acknowledging the tough macro. I'm just curious, is that decline from the first half? Is that more macro driven, or is that something that you're seeing as far as your individual NRR being affected?\nKate Bueker: Maybe I'll just kind of take a step back and talk about how we approach guidance. We approach guidance in a very consistent way. I just finished my fifth year at HubSpot and we have approached guidance in the same way every quarter during that period of time. And the way that we approach it is this, we try to create a set of numbers that we feel good about our ability to deliver across a variety of scenarios. And we took exactly the same approach this quarter. Both Yamini and I shared in our prepared remarks that the external environment remains challenged, and that is what is the foundational baseline assumption for our guidance. That said, we want to put forward guidance that we can deliver even if things get a little bit worse from here.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Turrin of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open, please go ahead.\nMichael Berg: Hi, you got Michael Berg on for Michael Turrin here. I wanted to ask on pricing and packaging. You've added like you've mentioned a number of times you've added quite a few features across all hubs, but notably Sales Hub. And as you incorporate generative AI, which we just had a pricing discussion, maybe you could help us understand how you might think about either increasing prices or taking more of the value you deliver to your customers? Thank you.\nYamini Rangan: Yes, Michael, I appreciate that question. Thank you. Our pricing philosophy has not changed. And if you step back and think about what our pricing as well as packaging philosophy has been, we add value first and then we think about pricing changes next. And when we had this discussion on AI monetization, I mentioned exactly the same thing, which is add value first and then kind of look at pricing. And you're absolutely right that we've added tremendous value in terms of Sales Hub. When we look at pricing packaging changes, for example, last year, we increased Marketing Hub Enterprise pricing, but that was after consistently adding value -- four years of adding value into that tier. And when we do that, we feel very, very comfortable on the impact we have in terms of our customers. And so we follow exactly that same pricing philosophy, whether it comes to AI or it comes to Sales Hub. Ultimately, we think that we're in the early stages of fairly big transformation, the transformation of us going from app to speed to platform is early, the transformation of us going to up-market as early. There's now the big shift that's happening with AI is early. And across all of that, our focus is add-value and gain market share and adoption and then monetize.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Turits of KeyCorp. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nMichael Turits: Hey guys, interesting discussion around NRR. So I guess same question around ASRPC; A, when you think that could start to reinflect up? And associated question, were you seeing -- you commented on ASRPC being stronger in the upper tiers as opposed to being dragged down by starter. So what was that breakout like? So acceleration or not going forward and between tiers this quarter?\nKate Bueker: Yeah. The ASRPC is obviously the other side of the coin to net customer additions. I think there's a little bit of a difference across the two metrics in the sense that ASRPC is a little bit more of a lagging metric as it reflects because revenue is the numerator, it reflects the activity that we've seen over the last four quarters. So anything that you're going to see in terms of movement in course is going to be a little bit more muted. What you did see with ASRPC is an expanded up in the low single digits, which is like what we expected and what we shared with you last quarter. And the drivers are the same ones that we talked about last quarter, the continued progress with multi-hub adoption in professional and enterprise was the big driver of the expansion. But again, there was an offset based on the significant net adds that we have seen over the last four quarters at that starter tier. Now as far as the ASRPC outlook, we think it's going to hang in and around these like low single digits for the next couple of quarters. But you are right, if we stripped out starter, we would see an ASRPC that is expanding at a higher rate.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Parker Lane of Stifel. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nParker Lane: Yeah, hi team. Thanks for taking the question here. Yamini, HubSpot has always been a very horizontal platform. And as you're making this up-market shift, do you see any appetite in the enterprise category, in particular, for more industry specific features and tools. And as you think about the future penetration of this opportunity, is it necessary to have those type of tools, or do you feel like there's enough work being done in the partner community and integrations that can support a healthy use case there?\nYamini Rangan: Yeah. Great question, Parker. I think it's more of the latter. If you think about the big transformations that we're on, we're going from this app to suite platform. We're going from the smaller end of SMB to up-market customers. And both of those are still fairly early innings. And if we look at our market share penetration across both of these, it's single digits. And we think that with the level of product innovation that's happening, as well as the focused execution. We have the opportunity to take it to strong double digit in terms of market share. So there's a lot of opportunity that is left that is still very much horizontal or list of innovation and a list of things that we can bring to add value to our customers remains really robust and long, and So, we're going to focus on all of those opportunities. And I think AI also gives us a tremendous opportunity to drive more market share gains as well as adoption within our markets. And as you said, like partners are certainly leaning into certain verticals, and they're more than welcome to continue to like do that, but we feel that the opportunity is still early stages with a tremendous runway ahead of core for our strategy now.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Keith Bachman of BMO. Your line is now open, please go ahead.\nAdam Holets: Hi, this is Adam on for Keith. Thank you for the question. I wanted to touch on the commission changes and any incremental feedback you might have on reactions there? And then second part would be -- does that have any effect on the decrease and starter [ph] to add?\nYamini Rangan: So let me start with the first part, which is the partner commission changes. We're really pleased with the response from the partner channel. And I've talked to many of our elite partners before the change after the change, and we are consistently getting feedback from our partner channel. And we spent a lot of time communicating to our partner channel on why we are changing this. And if you step back and think about we want to drive consistent value-added engagement with customers and our partners to be able to drive multi-hub adoption within our customer base. And so the commission changes were very much aligned to where we are going as a company. And in fact, we have seen partners increase engagement with our customers as a result of the change, which is a really nice bonus. And I think it's a win for our customers, partners, and in terms of HubSpot. And maybe, Kate, if you want to add on the starter, I don't think the partner commission change had any impact on the starter net adds, but you can certainly comment.\nKate Bueker: Yes, I would agree. The partners tend to be focused more upmarket in our customer base. And so the impact that they would have -- they did not have any impact on the quarter-over-quarter change in net customer adds.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kirk Materne of Evercore. Your line is now open, please go ahead.\nKirk Materne: Thanks very much. Yamini, I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about just the [Technical Difficulty] upmarket. Is that coming out of geographies, meaning US a little bit ahead of EMEA in terms of what you're doing in the Hub sales? And just any, I guess, commentary on the -- from a geographic perspective, if there's any real difference you're seeing in the US versus, say, outside the US? Thanks.\nYamini Rangan: Kirk, I didn't get the first maybe 10, 15 seconds of the question, I got the geo differences. Can you repeat the first part, please?\nKirk Materne: Sorry. You're seeing any dynamics -- market dynamics [Technical Difficulty]\nYamini Rangan: Okay. I think I got the geo differences. So, I'll say no notable differences across our major markets. And what I talked about as customer buying patterns, on one hand, they didn't get better, it didn't get worse, very similar trends in terms of looking at budget, having multiple stakeholders involved in decision-making and driving projects. So, I think that has remained consistent, so no notable differences. And maybe the other question was really, are there any differences as you think about up-market and multiple sales adoption or multi-hub adoption? And again, no notable differences. So I think the broader themes coming back to what we are seeing across the pipeline, lot more sales initiatives this year where our customers are focused on driving sales rep productivity, a lot more multi-hub adoption as people want to make sure that they are getting visibility across their entire customer pipeline and a lot more platform consolidation as they look to eliminate costs, as well as get just much better return for their investments. And across all regions, we're seeing the trend of becoming a platform of choice for the scaling companies. So high bar for action across all regions, but we continue to be very focused on executing to meet that high bar.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question for today comes from Taylor McGinnis of UBS. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nTaylor McGinnis: Yeah, hi. Thanks so much for taking my questions. Maybe on margin. So it looks like the 4Q guide implies mid-teens and previously the outlook called for high-teens. I know you had some good out-performance in the print it looks like the 3Q outlook is a little bit higher. So is it just the shifting of expenses between quarters, maybe some prudence in the forecast, or is your view on 4Q OpEx growth change or the level of investment, I guess, is there anything new that you would flag?\nKate Bueker: Yeah. Thanks for the question. We are very pleased with the progress we're making this year on expanding our margins. You saw record 7% increase in margins year-over-year in Q2. And just take a step back and think about what's driving that. We took a bunch of actions through the back half of last year to really pull back on hiring pretty significantly. And then we did a restructuring in January, and that is really showing up in the year-over-year leverage. If you think about where we're guiding for the full year, we are -- our operating profit margin guidance is 14%, which is a bit more than four points year-over-year increase over 2022. What I would tell you is we've been very prudent in the hiring that we've made in the first half of the year. We came out of the risk at the end of January, and we wanted to be very strategic about where we were adding heads. And as a result, we have -- we will see more of our hiring take place in Q3 and Q4 of this year versus our original plan. And that is what you're seeing in the seasonal margin in our guide.\nOperator: Thank you. We have no further questions for today. So that concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Kate Bueker",
            "content": "Thanks, Yamini. Let's turn to our second quarter 2023 financial results. Revenue grew 26% year-over-year in constant currency and 25% on an as-reported basis. Subscription revenue grew 26% year-over-year, while services and other revenue increased 23% on an as-reported basis. Domestic revenue grew 25% year-over-year, while international revenue growth was 29% in constant currency and 26% as reported. International revenue represented 47% of total revenue in Q2. We added over 7,600 net new customers in the quarter, bringing our total customer count to over 184,000, up 23% year-over-year. Average subscription revenue per customer grew 3% year-over-year in constant currency and 2% on an as-reported basis to $11,400. Our ASRPC growth was driven by continued multi-hub adoption by our professional and enterprise customers, offset by the large volume of starter customers we added at the low end of our bimodal strategy over the last few quarters. Gross retention remained healthy in the high 80s for the quarter. Net revenue retention was 103%, down one point sequentially, driven by continued spend optimization by our customers across seats, additions, contact tiers and portals. While we expect pressure on net revenue retention in the near-term to persist, we continue to see strong gross retention and believe we can maintain net revenue retention above 100%. Calculated billings were $542 million in the quarter, growing 22% year-over-year in constant currency and 25% as reported. The remainder of my comments will refer to non-GAAP measures. Operating margin was 14%, up seven points compared to the year ago period. On a year-over-year basis, operating margin benefited from the restructuring actions we took at the end of January as well as a seasonal shift in hiring into Q3 and Q4. While these factors have helped drive a step change in operating margin, we continue to invest in critical areas such as product innovation, AI and internal systems and data to ensure we're building the foundation for continued margin expansion as we scale. Net income was $70 million or $1.34 per fully diluted share. Free cash flow was $60 million or 11% of revenue, and our cash and marketable securities totaled $1.7 billion at the end of June. And with that, let's review our guidance for the third quarter and full year of 2023. As Yamini highlighted, we continue to operate in a difficult macro environment. Customer budgets remain tight decisions by committee or the norm and customers continue to look for ways to optimize existing spend. Our guidance assumes that these weak macroeconomic conditions persist throughout the second half of 2023. For the third quarter, total as reported revenue is expected to be in the range of $532 million to $534 million, up 20% year-over-year at the midpoint. We expect foreign exchange to be a 1- to 2-point tailwind to as reported revenue growth in the quarter. Non-GAAP operating profit is to be between $67 million and $69 million. Non-GAAP diluted net income per share is expected to be between $1.22 and $1.24. This assumes 52.6 million fully diluted shares outstanding. And for the full year of 2023, total as reported revenue is now expected to be in the range of $2.116 billion to $2.122 billion, up 22% year-over-year at the midpoint. We now expect foreign exchange to be a 0.5 point tailwind to as reported revenue growth. Non-GAAP operating profit is now expected to be between $293 million and $297 million. Non-GAAP diluted net income per share is now expected to be between $5.24 and $5.29. This assumes 52.3 million fully diluted shares outstanding. As you adjust your models, keep in mind the following: We expect CapEx as a percentage of revenue to be roughly 5% and free cash flow to be about $26 0 million for the full year of 2023. The with seasonally stronger free cash flow in Q4. And with that, I will hand things back over to Yamini for her closing remarks. Thanks, Elizabeth. This is Kate. I will start and then others can join if they want. Look I think you're asking about the free sign-ups because you saw a sequential drop in our net customer additions. I will confirm that, that is very much a dynamic happening with starter, we did see a quarter-over-quarter decline in starter. The free products that you highlight are one of a number of things that we use to drive demand at low end of our bimodal strategy, we consistently look to move functionality down into our free and starter products. We consistently experiment in pricing and packaging. We're launching free tools on a regular basis. And so there is a normal ebb and flow to the free user base and ultimately, the net starter additions that you'll see from one quarter to the next. Yeah. Thanks, Ryan, for the question. Net revenue retention, you're right on the quarterly math. For the quarter, net revenue retention was 103%, which was down 1%. I don't think we're going to comment on monthly trends here, but I will make a couple of comments on net revenue retention. The first, I guess, maybe I'll just start with the good news, which is our customer dollar retention, which we refer to as gross retention externally, remains steady in the high 80s, which provides a really nice foundation for us around net revenue retention overall. The area where we continue to see challenge is the same one we've been talking about for a number of quarters, which is on that net upgrade rate. So, kind of, going back to the back half of 2022, there was more consumption-driven motions like seats and contacts for us continue to be pressured. We're seeing that both on the downgrade side, but we're also seeing lower volume of customers adding contacts and seats in addition. And then finally, customers, you heard -- both Yamini and I talked about this in our prepared remarks, are really looking to optimize their spend across the board by sort of adjusting additions and consolidating their portals onto a single HubSpot instance, really looking for ways to maximize the ROI from our platform. Now, you asked a really hard question, which is like what is it going to turn? And I will admit is like really difficult to predict. Obviously, it's dependent at least in decent amount on macro pressure. What I will say is that we feel good about our ability to retain the customer dollar retention at that high 80s level, and we feel good about our ability to retain net revenue retention above 100. Yeah. Thanks for the question. I'll try to give a little bit more color on the billings because I will admit it's a little bit of a head scratcher this quarter. As we -- what we try to ground ourselves on is constant currency revenue growth as a baseline assumption that constant currency revenue and constant currency billings will grow together. And this quarter, what you saw is a little bit more of a gap. And you saw this really unusual thing where you had constant currency billings growth dipping below as reported billings growth and I would just note, like billings has two components to it. It has revenue and it has a change in deferred revenue. And while currency was a headwind to revenue, it was actually a tailwind to deferred revenue, which is why there was this three-point tailwind to billings growth in the quarter. And if you just look at that FX impact, that's half gap between constant currency billings growth and constant currency revenue growth. Other than that, there's not -- the trends are largely the same as the ones that we've been talking about. We continue to see a little bit of a decline in duration as our mix shift away from marketing and into sales and service, shift away from new into installed base. But we expect those two growth rates to come back together in Q3 as we have a call it more normal FX comparison. Yeah, I'll start. Net ads were down a bit from Q1 to Q2, but they were very much aligned with the expectations that we had internally and the expectations that we shared on the call last quarter. The other thing to note is they were much more balanced across addition than what we've seen over the last couple of quarters. In both Q4 and Q1, we were actually pretty surprised by the stronger performance in Starter that was really the driver of the overall new customer addition. So, yes, Starter did decline a little bit, but it is in line with our expectations, and we frankly would expect that it would sort of stay in and around these levels over the next couple of quarters. Maybe I'll just kind of take a step back and talk about how we approach guidance. We approach guidance in a very consistent way. I just finished my fifth year at HubSpot and we have approached guidance in the same way every quarter during that period of time. And the way that we approach it is this, we try to create a set of numbers that we feel good about our ability to deliver across a variety of scenarios. And we took exactly the same approach this quarter. Both Yamini and I shared in our prepared remarks that the external environment remains challenged, and that is what is the foundational baseline assumption for our guidance. That said, we want to put forward guidance that we can deliver even if things get a little bit worse from here. Yeah. The ASRPC is obviously the other side of the coin to net customer additions. I think there's a little bit of a difference across the two metrics in the sense that ASRPC is a little bit more of a lagging metric as it reflects because revenue is the numerator, it reflects the activity that we've seen over the last four quarters. So anything that you're going to see in terms of movement in course is going to be a little bit more muted. What you did see with ASRPC is an expanded up in the low single digits, which is like what we expected and what we shared with you last quarter. And the drivers are the same ones that we talked about last quarter, the continued progress with multi-hub adoption in professional and enterprise was the big driver of the expansion. But again, there was an offset based on the significant net adds that we have seen over the last four quarters at that starter tier. Now as far as the ASRPC outlook, we think it's going to hang in and around these like low single digits for the next couple of quarters. But you are right, if we stripped out starter, we would see an ASRPC that is expanding at a higher rate. Yes, I would agree. The partners tend to be focused more upmarket in our customer base. And so the impact that they would have -- they did not have any impact on the quarter-over-quarter change in net customer adds. Yeah. Thanks for the question. We are very pleased with the progress we're making this year on expanding our margins. You saw record 7% increase in margins year-over-year in Q2. And just take a step back and think about what's driving that. We took a bunch of actions through the back half of last year to really pull back on hiring pretty significantly. And then we did a restructuring in January, and that is really showing up in the year-over-year leverage. If you think about where we're guiding for the full year, we are -- our operating profit margin guidance is 14%, which is a bit more than four points year-over-year increase over 2022. What I would tell you is we've been very prudent in the hiring that we've made in the first half of the year. We came out of the risk at the end of January, and we wanted to be very strategic about where we were adding heads. And as a result, we have -- we will see more of our hiring take place in Q3 and Q4 of this year versus our original plan. And that is what you're seeing in the seasonal margin in our guide."

            "content": "Thank you so much, Chuck, and welcome to everyone joining us on the call. Today, I want to highlight our continued momentum in Q2, reiterate our playbook for winning in this macro environment, and close with updates on our generative AI road map as well as insights based on customer usage. Let's jump into our Q2 results. Q2 was a solid quarter for HubSpot with revenue growing 26% year-over-year in constant currency. We delivered 700 basis points of margin expansion year-over-year, driving operating margin to 14%. We have talked about our strategy for balancing growth and profitability, and we are purposefully executing against this strategy. I'm really happy with the operating leverage we delivered while driving growth in the quarter. Total customers grew by 23% to over 184,000 globally, fueled by over 7,600 net customer additions in the quarter. I'm very pleased with the strong results in Q2. The consistent performance demonstrated by our team and the momentum we have in becoming the platform of choice for scaling companies. Q2 results were driven by two key themes; our ability to deliver product innovation for our customers and our ability to consistently execute our bimodal go-market strategy. As you have seen over the past two years, our bimodal strategy is working, our starter tier continues to fuel volume on the low end of the market, driven by product and pricing optimization. That said, the story in Q2 was about market momentum with continued growth in multi-hub as well as full suite adoption. We saw more new customers starting with multiple hubs, fueling larger deals. 1/ 3 of our Pro and Enterprise customers are now on 3 or more hubs, which is up by 4 points year-over-year. In addition, we continue to see Sales Hub pick up steam with larger customers. Our investment in upmarket functionality, like customization and extensibility and governance is paying off as we win bigger deals with Sales Hub. Service Hub also gained traction upmarket in this quarter with 12 of our 25 largest deals, including a Service Hub attach. Companies are looking to improve handoffs across their marketing, sales and service teams, and they want a clear schedule of customer insights. By connecting Sales Hub and Service Hub, support can lock tickets that the sales team can now see because there is 1 central contact record. That context helps sales team close deals and is just 1 example of why a connected front office platform is so powerful. Take MarineMax, a national boat retailer, for example, before HubSpot, their legacy CRM was causing a disjointed customer experience. They couldn't effectively valve leads from marketing to sales and because the CRM was difficult to use sales reps weren't adopting it. Since switching to HubSpot and adopting Marketing Hub, Sales Hub, Service Hub and Ops Hub, MarineMax has increased annual revenue by 113% and reduced their average sales response time from days to minutes. They now have a shared visibility across the entire customer journey, leading to a better and faster customer experience. I love hearing that our connected value proposition is resonating and that our product innovation is driving clear value for customers. Now, I want to shift gears to talk about the macro environment. Overall, customer buying trends remain steady. Budgets remain under scrutiny. Multiple stakeholders continue to be involved in decisions. And while buying trends have not improved, they have not gotten worse either. Customers are continuing to optimize their budgets, and we can see this optimization across seats, additions, contact tiers and portals. The board by [ph] has risen, but companies are continuing to invest in digital transformation and prioritized platform level decisions. This is where HubSpot shines. We have a proven playbook for driving growth with our product innovation and focused execution. On the product side, HubSpot continues to win by being extremely easy to use and extremely powerful under the head. Our product innovation is in high gear, and I want to highlight just a few developments from the quarter. With Marketing Hub, we doubled down on omnichannel by moving Instagram reels into public beta as marketers increasingly focused on short-form social video. We also introduced Event Visualizer to give customers even more insight into their audiences activity and get deeper analytics on customer behavior. With Service Hub, we introduced content Assistant into inbox, so that service teams can leverage gen AI to respond to customers faster across various channels. We're also enabling teams to summarize customer conversations with gen AI and move that functionality into private beta in Q2. Lastly, on our path to building a more customizable and extensible CRM, we released customized pipeline use, enabling our customers to edit their views based on currency and tags that are specific to their business. We also improved permissions and user management for custom objects. This has been a top request from our enterprise customers. Our pay for product innovation is just cranking and I'm very pleased with the progress we are making in becoming the platform of choice for scaling companies. On the go-to-market side, how we sell is why we've been. We've built a competitive moat with three go-to-market motions, product-driven, partner-driven, and direct sales-driven. Our customers tell us that the way our sales and customer success teams serve them sets us apart. They see a notable difference in our team's ability to move quickly to demo the value of HubSpot, articulate clear platform consolidation benefits, and lineup the best partners to deliver services. Today, over 40% of all newcomer ARR and existing customer expansion is co-sold and influenced by our partners, just awesome stuff. While the macro environment remains challenging, what we sell and how we sell continue to be unique differentiators for HubSpot to drive durable profitable growth. Lastly, let's shift gears to talk about everyone's favorite topic, generative AI. Last quarter, we talked about Gen AI, and it is a transformative shift for SMBs and what this means for marketing, sales and service. In short, we believe AI will not replace go-to-market teams, it will guide and assist them to drive better customer outcomes. Today, I want to provide an overview of how we're building an entire layer of AI assistance across our platform, how our customers are responding, and what our unique differentiators are with AI. We launched ChatSpot earlier this year, and it has quickly grown to 70,000 total users with 20,000 prompts ingested weekly. Our customers tell us that they like our weekly updates. They love how quickly we are innovating with new AI capabilities, and they're getting value from the breadth of actions ChatSpot is helping them take. Customers are using ChatSpot to prospects for good fit companies based on location, industry, recent news, and more. They're creating entire campaigns with SEO research, block title generation, and image generation, all from within ChatSpot. The easy chat interface combined with the power of HubSpot's platform have our customers eager for what's next with ChatSpot. We also launched Content Assistant earlier this year, and since moving it to public beta in June, adoption has grown by 10x, with 26% of our enterprise customers using it today. Customers are describing Content Assistant as a game-changer because they can quickly generate social copy, block content, prospecting e-mails, all based on insights without having to leave HubSpot. Content Assistant embeds Gen AI into our customers' natural workflow, helping them work faster and smarter, right where they are. As I look at our AI roadmap, we are ambitiously building AI into the entire CRM platform, so our customers can get even more value from our platform. We want to help scaling companies power their entire customer journey with AI, and we believe we can help them leverage AI better than other platforms for three reasons. First, data is the fuel for AI and HubSpot has unique data. While other platforms provide data on who your customers are, HubSpot has data on who your customers are, what they did across channels, what they bought. And when we bring together the power of large language models with deep contextual first-party data in HubSpot CRM, magic happens. Second, HubSpot is where work gets done in the front office. We own the workflows that scaling businesses use every day. We're beginning to see this play out with content assistant usage that I just mentioned. Finally, gen AI needs human intervention to work responsibly and we've always had a human centric approach to product innovation. We're committed to having strong customer feedback loop and implementing the feedback very quickly. We're well-positioned to become the AI leader for scaling companies, and we're moving fast. We are prioritizing AI use cases in our roadmap and without giving too much away, AI is going to be a major theme at our INBOUND conference in September. I'm really excited for you to learn a lot more about our AI strategy and roadmap at our upcoming conference. Reflecting on the quarter, I'm very pleased with how our teams are driving the pace of product innovation, focusing on iterating fast with AI, while executing on our bimodal strategy. This focus and alignment is what will continue to set us apart to drive full and profitable growth. With that, I'll turn the call over to Kate to take you through our Q2 financial results. Kate? Thank you so much, Kate. I want to close with our commitment to building a sustainable and equitable company. One of our goals as an organization is to build a company future generation will be proud of. making progress on our environmental, social and governance efforts is a critical part of that journey. We released our annual sustainability report in Q2, and I want to highlight a few key developments. On the environmental side, we submitted our targets for validation by the science-based targets initiative, joining over 5,000 companies committed to ambitious climate action. In our effort to build a more diverse and inclusive company, we reached 47% female representation company-wide, nearing gender parity. We launched a customer trust center for our customers so they can learn more about our security, privacy, compliance and governance practices. I'm really proud of the progress we are making to build a diverse and sustainable company. I want to thank our customers, our partners and our shareholders for the continued support of HubSpot. And a big thank you to all our employees who are executing with focus and solving our customers every day. I look forward to seeing many of you at our Analyst Day as part of our INBOUND 2023 event on September 6. With that, operator, let's open up the call for questions. Yes. Thank you, Samad, for that question. Definitely pleased with the continued momentum of market. And as you know, we look at our target market as the 1,000 to 2,000 employee segment with upmarket being the 200 to 2,000 employee segment. And look, we've had a lot of focus and investments going into upmarket segments, so we're gaining traction for a variety of reasons, including all of the ones that you just mentioned. But maybe just to give a little bit of color, I'll start with what we're seeing with upmarket customers. And there are a couple of customer trends that we see up market. First off, upmarket customers are consolidating on platforms. Over the last couple of years, they've bought a number of disparate systems, and this is the time that they're focused on eliminating costs, but also getting clear visibility across the entire customer journey and so that driving interest. I think the second thing is focus this year for upmarket customers has been on sales productivity. Headcount is constrained in this environment, but customers still need to hit their growth targets. So, they're leaning into equipping their sales reps with the right technology solution that needs to be successful, and we certainly see larger sales Hub-driven deals within our customer buying patterns. Now, having said that, upmarket has been a strategic priority across the company, both from a product and go-to-market side. Our product has gotten much better, and it's meeting the needs of upmarket customers and this has been a constant drumbeat across the past few quarters. And ultimately, a product is easy to use but very, very powerful under the hood, and that's a differentiator. I think the perception has also improved upmarket. We're gaining momentum with exact and scaling companies and we've always had like a great relationship with CMOs and the marketing organization, but now CEO, CFO, COOs, know and understand the value of HubSpot there as well. And then finally, I think both the product -- both the partner teams as well as the direct teams are really able to clearly communicate the value of HubSpot as well as drive cost savings for our customers and how we sell is also why we win. So, we're pleased with the progress of market, and I think all of those factors really play into it. See you there. Mark, that's a great insightful question. I think like this goes back to the fact that we are in the middle of a fairly big transformation at HubSpot, one that we've been talking about for many years. We've been on this journey to go from app to suite to platform. And when we go from app to suite and Sales Hub becomes a legitimate front door then it actually drives faster adoption within the installed base. So the second product and the third product, new ports product, they have the benefit of having the install base of the first product. And that's what you're beginning to see. I think that, again, maybe dissecting the customer trends from what we see internally. From the customer side, every leader that I talked to, they're looking at ways to eliminate cost but drive better results. And over the last couple of years, they bought a ton of point solutions, and they're either struggling to integrate those solutions or the cost of these solutions are prohibitive. And we are now being seen as a powerful, cost-effective platform within this environment, and that helps with Sales Hub momentum because if you are a Marketing Hub customer, then it makes a lot more sense to get Sales Hub or if you're looking at ways to drive cost savings than buying multiple hubs and kind of eliminating costs, while getting better customer insights is working. Having the other part of it is that one of our strategic priorities this year was to double down and focus on driving product leadership in marketing, Sales and Service Hub, and that's exactly what our product teams are focused on innovating, and that's what you're seeing play out Sales Hub because it's now a really legitimate front door to HubSpot and we've talked about the steady drumbeat of product releases that are aimed at expanding our market opportunity within Sales Hub and we're also driving our ability to serve more sophisticated use cases. And just this past quarter in Q2, we released sequences on mobile, driving more prospecting efficiency with reporting, better embedded pipeline metrics. All of these are just examples of functionality within our sales hub that drive up market momentum and things that our customers have been asking for. So, I'd go back to second, third hubs always have the benefit of the first one. And when customer needs meet with product innovation meet with go-to-market execution, then we begin to see the consistency of the results that we are seeing now. Yes. Great question. I'll start, and Dharmesh, feel free to just chime in there on the development side as well. Look, I think our focus is really that 20 to 200 and then 200 to 2,000 customer base and you're absolutely right. I think the list of innovation and a list of things that we can continue to do to expand our share of that market is there, and that's exactly why this is our number one priority within the company. We want to increase that product depth and leadership within that market. And so there's a long list of innovation that we are -- we know we're working on and our product and pace of innovation within product has been pretty high over the past few quarters exactly for that reason, so we can meet the needs of the customers. I do think at the same time, they look at us as a way to get visibility across all of the products that are organically built while eliminating the cost, which is why you see us as a platform of choice for these enterprise companies. Now, Gen AI certainly has the potential to accelerate productivity, not just in front office functions, but also for engineering and certainly something that we are looking at, but it's pretty early days in terms of driving the pace of innovation even further. Dharmesh, feel free to add there. Yeah, Brian, I think it's happening in mid-market as well. There is absolutely no doubt that we see it. And for us, mid-market is that to 20 to 200 person company. That's what we call as mid-market. And if you look at what is driving vendor consolidation across all of the segments that we are in, it's the last couple of years of how customers have grown. SMBs were thrown into the digital environment post the pandemic and during the pandemic, they went in and bought a number of point solutions and -- or they went and got some enterprise-class solutions. And both of those have proven to be pretty costly in terms of maintaining the tech stack, but also pretty brittle in terms of getting customer insights. And so if you look at a mid-market company, they are also in the same place of looking at eliminating costs while driving better customer insights and we see the same trend play out within mid-market. And again, we begin to see more multi-hub and even full suite pro and enterprise deals within the mid-market segment. Yes. Thanks a lot for that question, Brad. This is Yamini. We're very clearly excited about generative AI. It is a pretty big transformative shift. And I think we look at it as being well-positioned to serve the SMB market. And historically, if you've looked at HubSpot, we've done a really good job of taking powerful sophisticated technology and bringing it to bear within the SMB market. And this market is quite different from other kinds of segments because they typically don't have AI, ML experts and resources. And so we take our job pretty seriously to take powerful technology and democratize there. Now, specifically, on your question on monetization, we have a very clear first principle when it comes to monetization. And our principle is that we focus on delivering customer value first, and from there, monetization will follow. And we're going to apply that same first principle to AI. And when we think about this market, we're clearly in the early stages of iterating fast and adding value for customers. We're beginning to see that with both ChatSpot and Content Assistant in all of the use cases that we have in beta so far. Once we know what value we are adding to customers, then we'll follow a bimodal strategy to monetization. And what I mean by that is, on one hand, we'll likely democratize AI features and make it available in our freemium and starter tiers to drive adoption, you've seen that play out. We've taken really high-value features and added it to free and starter and that helped with adoption, but that also helps as an on-ramp to our other peers. And then the second part of what we'll likely do is drive higher value ASP with more specialized features. And this can certainly come in the form of adding certain features to higher additions like pro and enterprise. It can also come from packaging AI features into more specialized add-ons. So we're certainly thinking about all of that. But the first priority for us is move fast, iterate fast and add a ton of value for our customers specifically within the SMB segment. We want to be the AI leaders within the SMB segment and for scaling companies. Yes, Michael, I appreciate that question. Thank you. Our pricing philosophy has not changed. And if you step back and think about what our pricing as well as packaging philosophy has been, we add value first and then we think about pricing changes next. And when we had this discussion on AI monetization, I mentioned exactly the same thing, which is add value first and then kind of look at pricing. And you're absolutely right that we've added tremendous value in terms of Sales Hub. When we look at pricing packaging changes, for example, last year, we increased Marketing Hub Enterprise pricing, but that was after consistently adding value -- four years of adding value into that tier. And when we do that, we feel very, very comfortable on the impact we have in terms of our customers. And so we follow exactly that same pricing philosophy, whether it comes to AI or it comes to Sales Hub. Ultimately, we think that we're in the early stages of fairly big transformation, the transformation of us going from app to speed to platform is early, the transformation of us going to up-market as early. There's now the big shift that's happening with AI is early. And across all of that, our focus is add-value and gain market share and adoption and then monetize. Yeah. Great question, Parker. I think it's more of the latter. If you think about the big transformations that we're on, we're going from this app to suite platform. We're going from the smaller end of SMB to up-market customers. And both of those are still fairly early innings. And if we look at our market share penetration across both of these, it's single digits. And we think that with the level of product innovation that's happening, as well as the focused execution. We have the opportunity to take it to strong double digit in terms of market share. So there's a lot of opportunity that is left that is still very much horizontal or list of innovation and a list of things that we can bring to add value to our customers remains really robust and long, and So, we're going to focus on all of those opportunities. And I think AI also gives us a tremendous opportunity to drive more market share gains as well as adoption within our markets. And as you said, like partners are certainly leaning into certain verticals, and they're more than welcome to continue to like do that, but we feel that the opportunity is still early stages with a tremendous runway ahead of core for our strategy now. So let me start with the first part, which is the partner commission changes. We're really pleased with the response from the partner channel. And I've talked to many of our elite partners before the change after the change, and we are consistently getting feedback from our partner channel. And we spent a lot of time communicating to our partner channel on why we are changing this. And if you step back and think about we want to drive consistent value-added engagement with customers and our partners to be able to drive multi-hub adoption within our customer base. And so the commission changes were very much aligned to where we are going as a company. And in fact, we have seen partners increase engagement with our customers as a result of the change, which is a really nice bonus. And I think it's a win for our customers, partners, and in terms of HubSpot. And maybe, Kate, if you want to add on the starter, I don't think the partner commission change had any impact on the starter net adds, but you can certainly comment. Kirk, I didn't get the first maybe 10, 15 seconds of the question, I got the geo differences. Can you repeat the first part, please? Okay. I think I got the geo differences. So, I'll say no notable differences across our major markets. And what I talked about as customer buying patterns, on one hand, they didn't get better, it didn't get worse, very similar trends in terms of looking at budget, having multiple stakeholders involved in decision-making and driving projects. So, I think that has remained consistent, so no notable differences. And maybe the other question was really, are there any differences as you think about up-market and multiple sales adoption or multi-hub adoption? And again, no notable differences. So I think the broader themes coming back to what we are seeing across the pipeline, lot more sales initiatives this year where our customers are focused on driving sales rep productivity, a lot more multi-hub adoption as people want to make sure that they are getting visibility across their entire customer pipeline and a lot more platform consolidation as they look to eliminate costs, as well as get just much better return for their investments. And across all regions, we're seeing the trend of becoming a platform of choice for the scaling companies. So high bar for action across all regions, but we continue to be very focused on executing to meet that high bar."

Now, it\u2019s my pleasure to turn over the call to HubSpot\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, Yamini Rangan. Yamini?\nYamini Rangan: Thank you so much, Chuck and welcome to everyone joining us on the call. Today, I want to focus on our start to 2023, share observations on the current macro environment and provide some perspective on what generative AI means for HubSpot and our customers. Let\u2019s start with our Q1 results. We had a solid start to the year with revenue growing 30% in constant currency year-over-year. We delivered more than 4 points of margin expansion year-over-year, bringing operating margins to over 13%. Total customers grew by 23% to over 177,000 customers globally, fueled by net customer additions of over 9,900 in the quarter. I\u2019m pleased with our momentum coming into the year and the focused execution by the HubSpot team. These results show that our product innovation is in high gear and that our bimodal go-to-market strategy is working. Our focus with our bimodal strategy remains clear. We want to drive volume at the lower end of the market while driving increased value upmarket. In Q1, we continue to gain momentum in both segments of the market. On the lower end, we saw a significant uptick in our net customer additions. This was driven by strength in free sign-ups and pricing optimization plays we ran in our starter edition. In addition to that, HubSpot is powerful, yet easy to use, and we are increasingly becoming the platform of choice for scaling companies. Looking up market, we continue to see our multi-hub value proposition resonating. More professional and enterprise customers are starting with multiple hubs and over 45% of our ARR installed base is now on 3 or more hubs. Upmarket customers are increasingly looking for two things: a single source of truth that provides full visibility across their entire customer journey and clear cost savings in this environment. HubSpot\u2019s connected platform delivers both. Specifically, Sales Hub continued to gain momentum in Q1 as customers look to build tighter alignment between marketing and sales to drive more efficiency across the front office. Take Liquidity Services a B2B e-commerce marketplace, as an example. After adopting Sales Hub and Marketing comp, they were able to eliminate 8 other tools, reducing their overall cost by 50%. They were able to connect their marketing and sales data to get better insights and drive an increase in their conversions and campaign effectiveness. This is a great example of our customers, driving growth with multi-hub, while saving time and budget. We also saw Operations Hub come up in more deals as customers focused on consolidation. They see the clear value of a solution that can connect systems, automate processes and demonstrate value, especially in this economic environment. In fact, over two-thirds of our top 25 deals closed in Q1 adopted Ops Hub, leveraging multiple hubs boost efficiency and I am excited by the value our customers are seeing from our connected platform. As you can see, our bimodal strategy is working, and we will continue to maintain our pace of product innovation. Next, I want to shift gears and share what we\u2019re seeing in the macro environment. Overall, we continue to operate in a tough environment and we are not out of the woods yet. While we see our top-of-funnel activity improving, sales cycles remain long and budgets remain under scrutiny. These patients by committee have become the norm with multiple executives involved in sales cycles. It is clear based on my conversations with customers that they\u2019re continuing to tighten their belts in terms of budget, and we can see this in optimization across seats, contact tiers and portals. Decision-makers are focused on budget optimization and continue to spend cautiously. Now despite these challenges, we have a solid playbook for executing and driving sustainable growth. We remain focused on product innovation and consistent execution. On the product side, we\u2019re cranking. One of our strategic objectives is to become the market share leader in marketing, sales and service for scaling companies and we remain focused on delivering depth of features in order to get there. In Q1, with Marketing Hub, we moved customer journey analytics to general availability and the strong adoption and usage we\u2019re seeing gives me confidence that we are driving meaningful innovation that serves marketeers needs today. With Sales Hub, we significantly enhanced the sequences tools for upmarket customers with selective treating and advanced permissioning and removed generative AI e-mail functionality to beta. We also launched a key Service Hub Enterprise feature with multiple knowledge bases. This has been a top product request from upmarket customers who need to be able to support various audiences, products or brands. And in payments and commerce, we introduced dual subscriptions and moved payable invoices to private beta. I\u2019m thrilled with the progress we are making on our journey to become the number one CRM for scaling companies. On the go-to-market side, our strategy has been to focus on total cost of ownership for customers and communicating the value of HubSpot. Our quick time to value and connected platform message is clearly resonating as customers look to become more effective and efficient. We are driving enablement across both our direct and partner channels and we are keenly focused on value-centric conversations. Looking ahead, we\u2019ll continue to navigate this macro environment by following our playbook to drive product innovation and consistent strong execution. Now I want to double click on innovation and share how we\u2019re thinking about generative AI and why we are well positioned to add even more value for our customers. We are in the early stages of a transformative shift. Generative AI is rapidly changing the landscape in 3 fundamental ways. It helps businesses generate content, generate insights and generate code, all using natural language. This will be a massive opportunity for SMBs and scaling companies. Activities that once took them time, money and deep expertise no longer do with Gen AI. And this shift will enable SMBs to reach more customers, serve them at record speed with unprecedented relevance. So what does this really mean for marketing sales and service professionals? In the simplest terms, we believe AI will guide go-to-market teams and make them more effective. This will fuel a new era of AI guided growth for our customers. When we bring together the power of foundational models with the deep contextual data in HubSpot CRM, we can help go-to-market teams drive better results. Marketers can use Gen AI to guide them in creating more effective block poles, e-mail campaigns and social content. Salespeople can use it to guide them to write better prospecting e-mail and deliver more relevant insights for customers and service professionals can use Gen AI to anticipate customer needs, suggest resolutions and offer proactive support. We believe AI won\u2019t replace go-to-market teams. It will guide them to drive better outcomes. While there will be efficiency benefits, we\u2019re even more excited about effectiveness gains and the ability to drive guided growth for customers. While we are in the early stages of Gen AI, HubSpot has unique differentiators. First, we have unique data and broad distribution. HubSpot CRM data is unified and cohesive making it easier for AI to ingest and drive relevance. Second, we\u2019re at the center of our customers\u2019 workflows. HubSpot is where work gets done. So we can bring relevance to generate content and insights across the entire front office. We\u2019re not another AI point solution. We are an all-in-one CRM platform powered by AI. Third, we have always had a human-centric approach in companies with a human feedback loop or at an advantage with AI. We made a ton of progress in Q1 with the launches of content assistant in public beta and chat spot in public alpha. Since our launch in March, we\u2019ve had over 40,000 users sign up for ChatSpot, and the early feedback has been very positive. Content Assistant has thousands of users to date, and we are seeing customers leveraging it daily for creating marketing e-mails, blog posts, landing pages and more. We\u2019re ambitiously integrating AI across our entire CRM platform. So our customers don\u2019t have to become AI expert to reap the transformational benefits. I am incredibly excited that the opportunity AI is creating to deliver even more value for our customers. Reflecting on the quarter, I am pleased with the progress we made on our path to becoming a CRM platform of choice for scaling companies. Our teams maintained the pace of product innovation and drove strong execution, which was just fantastic to see. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Kate to take you through Q1 results in more detail.\nKate Bueker: Thanks, Yamini. Let\u2019s turn to our Q1 2023 financial results. Revenue grew 30% year-over-year in constant currency and 27% on an as-reported basis. Subscription revenue grew 27% year-over-year, while services and other revenue increased 12% on an as-reported basis. Domestic revenue grew 27% year-over-year, while international revenue growth was 33% in constant currency and 26% as reported. International revenue represented 46% of total revenue. . We added over 9,900 net new customers in the quarter, bringing our total customer count to over 177,000, up 23% year-over-year. Starter customer acquisition continued to fuel our strong net adds again in Q1. Average subscription revenue per customer grew 6% year-over-year in constant currency and 3% on an as-reported basis to $11,400. Our ASRPC growth was driven by continued multi-hub adoption by our professional and enterprise customers, offset by the large volume of starter customers we added at the low end of our bimodal strategy. Gross retention remained healthy in the high 80s for the quarter. Net revenue retention was 104%, down 3 points sequentially, driven by further customer optimization of HubSpot spend as well as slower expansion across seats, contact tiers and portals. While we expect pressure on net revenue retention in the near term to persist, we continue to believe we can maintain net revenue retention above 100%. Calculated billings were $533 million in the quarter, growing 28% year-over-year in constant currency and 26% as reported. The remainder of my comments will refer to non-GAAP measures. Operating margin was 13%, up 4 points compared to the year ago period. Operating margins benefited from restructuring actions we implemented at the end of January, which impacted our head count and facilities costs, including a temporary pause in overall hiring in Q1. Net income was $62 million or $1.20 per fully diluted share. Free cash flow was $85 million or 17% of revenue, and our cash and marketable securities totaled $1.6 billion at the end of March. And with that, let\u2019s review our guidance for the second quarter and full year of 2023. As Yamini highlighted, we continue to operate in a difficult macro environment with customer behavior that is similar to what we saw in the second half of 2022. Budgets are tight, decision by committee has become the norm, and customers are spending cautiously on new products while looking for ways to optimize existing spend. Our guidance assumes that these weak macroeconomic conditions persist throughout 2023. For the second quarter, total as reported revenue is expected to be in the range of $503 million to $505 million, up 19% year-over-year at the midpoint. We expect foreign exchange to be about a point of headwind to as reported revenue growth in the quarter. Non-GAAP operating profit is expected to be between $54 million and $56 million. Non-GAAP diluted net income per share is expected to be between $0.98 and $1. This assumes 52.4 million fully diluted shares outstanding. And for the full year of 2023, total as reported revenue is now expected to be in the range of $2.08 billion to $2.088 billion, up 20% year-over-year at the midpoint. Non-GAAP operating profit is now expected to be between $275 million and $279 million. We now expect foreign exchange to have a neutral impact to as reported revenue and operating profit margin for the full year of 2023. Non-GAAP diluted net income per share is now expected to be between $4.80 and $4.85. This assumes 52.3 million fully diluted shares outstanding. As you adjust your models, keep in mind the following: we expect CapEx as a percentage of revenue to be roughly 5% and free cash flow to be about $245 million for the full year of 2023, with seasonally stronger free cash flow in Q4. And with that, I will hand things back over to Yamini for her closing remarks.\nYamini Rangan: Thank you so much, Kate. I want to close with our commitment to driving durable, profitable growth long term. Looking ahead, we remain focused on foundational investments that will help us scale. As I shared during our last earnings call, we are doubling down on better development and high performance, better hybrid connection for our people, employees all over the world and better systems and automation internally. These initiatives will enable us to drive more efficiency long term and deliver even more value for our customers. I believe we have the right strategy and the right team to navigate this environment and emerge stronger. I want to thank our customers, our employees, our partners and our shareholders for the continued support on this journey. With that, operator, let\u2019s open up the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Keith Bachman of BMO. Please proceed.\nKeith Bachman: Hi, many thanks and congrats on a solid quarter and guide. I wanted just to focus my question on generative AI. You talked about some of the activities and certainly enjoyed Dharmesh\u2019s video some time ago. But I wanted to hear how do you plan on monetizing it as you look out over the horizon? So is it a skew? Is it a pricing activity? How do you think about monetization? And as part of that is, when do you think some of these activities will be moved from beta to production environments? In other words, when might investors begin to see the benefits of AI in your financial results? Many thanks.\nYamini Rangan: Hey, Keith. Thanks a lot for your question. This is Yamini. Very excited about generative AI. It is very transformative. And if you kind of like step back HubSpot got started when there was a fairly big shift that was happening in how people buy. And that led to us coming up and helping customers on how to market and sell. And we think generative AI is as transformative. And this is going to really cause our customers to think about how they market and sell. And so we think there is a lot of exciting potential. In terms of the monetization question, we have a very clear first principle when it comes to monetization. We focus on delivering customer value first and from there on, monetization will follow. And we think that this is pretty early days in terms of monetizing. Having said that, we are iterating fast, we are getting tons of feedback, especially with ChatSpot as well as content assistant that we just talked about and we are improving these use cases so we can continue to innovate for our customers and really help them get much more value with this transformative technology. As we do this, some of the features are just going to become table stakes. They will just be part of our core products and part of how we drive customer engagement and adoption within the core product. Now, if there are more specialized use cases, then maybe it goes into higher value additions like co and enterprise and will increase our ASP longer term, and that\u2019s how we\u2019re thinking about monetization. First, we want to focus on delivering value for the product. You asked the last question, which was when do we plan to get this into the hands of customers? Well, we launched pretty quickly within the market in March. It\u2019s alpha and data. We\u2019re getting a lot of the feedback and the teams are pretty excited. We are having a lot of Hackathon internally, and there is a long list of use cases that our teams are working on. So I think you\u2019ll see us maintain and even accelerate our pace of innovation, where we will be introducing features in weeks, not months or quarters. So lots of exciting developments here.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy of JPMorgan. You may proceed.\nMark Murphy: Thank you. Congrats on the great execution during the quarter. Yamini, I\u2019m noticing that HubSpot just has such a huge list of free products at this point. There is free CRM, free CMS, free form builder, free business templates. So much is free, but your margins are expanding despite that. I\u2019m wondering if you could comment on just how large an energetic that on-ramp is from free customers at the top of the funnel. And then for Kate, is it boosting kind of your multiyear visibility because it feels like you have these millions of little seeds that are there, that are kind of just starting to sprout and you can probably project forward and look at how it would turn into revenue.\nYamini Rangan: Hey, Mark, I\u2019ll get started with the question and then Kate can answer. I love that question because it really gets to the heart of our strategy. When HubSpot got started, we had the deep conviction that we want to add as much value for our customers as possible and continue to get the most adoption from small, medium as well as scaling businesses and the free tools is really part of that strategy to get the widest possible top of the funnel. And by the way, the free tools have a ton of value. I mean \u2013 you talked about free CMS. That adds a lot of value in a company getting a digital presence and getting started. There are a number of other growth tools. And that\u2019s clearly the strategy and tying this maybe to something that I just talked about, which is the bimodal strategy. When you have a really wide funnel, which is what free tools like this creates then we work to continue to deliver value. And so the number of starter customers and the conversion from free sign-ups to pay customers increases. And we\u2019ve been looking at this over the past few quarters. We\u2019re very happy with how that conversion continues to happen. And even from our starter customers, how they continue to get value in terms of pro and enterprise. So it\u2019s really our strategy for delivering value that works. And Kate, maybe you want to address the second part of the question there.\nKate Bueker: Yes. Sure thing. Thanks, Mark. I think there is a lot of reasons to really love the strategy of our product-led growth. I would not say that increased visibility over the long-term is one of them. That said, it\u2019s a really great low-cost way to get lots of customers using HubSpot really early in their business life cycle. And we think it creates a lot of interesting dynamics over and above just the economics, which I can talk about. It creates a nice moat, a competitive for us against low-end disruption, it also enhances pretty dramatically the value of our overall platform just based on the scale of customers at the low end. Now some portion of those starter customers will upgrade to Pro and Enterprise over time. I think you already know that. Oftentimes, that happens with a bit of a faster sales cycle that we also like. But this is really just one of many motions that will drive our growth over time.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Samad Samana of Jefferies. You may proceed.\nSamad Samana: Hi. Great quarter, guys. Yamini, I feel like for the last couple, you\u2019ve talked a lot more about market customers and how much the portfolio is attracting larger customers. And I think sales up has been an integral part of that and the maturity of the product seems to be really unlocking this kind of next tier of customer size. I\u2019m just curious if you think that that\u2019s an even bigger key than marketing hubs maturity to unlocking those larger customers that you\u2019ve been talking more and more about.\nYamini Rangan: Thank you, Samad for that question. We\u2019re really happy with Sales Hub as well as what it unlocks up market. And I think Marketing Hub is $1 billion-plus kind of product line that\u2019s got the ability to go to multibillion and Sales Hub is a $500 million-plus business that can grow into multiple billions, and both of them are kind of going at plan. We\u2019re super happy with that. Now specifically looking at Sales Hub, we\u2019ve been on the steady march over the past few years to build the functionality that a true upmarket business needs to have as a system of record. And I think we\u2019ve reached that point. We have hit that critical mass for an upmarket customer. We are a viable alternative to other legacy enterprise actions within the market and Sales Hub is now a legitimate front door to HubSpot. And this is a couple of reasons, right? On the product side, we\u2019re now serving larger customers and more sophisticated use cases. The steady drumbeat of product releases that you\u2019ve been hearing from us are just all aimed at expanding our upmarket TAM, and these are custom objects and CRM customization, deeper permissioning, more features for admin. All of that is working. In addition to that, over the last couple of quarters, we\u2019re also adding our ability to serve more sophisticated use cases, right? I just talked about sequencing. That\u2019s something upmarket customers have needed much more ability to do in addition to that sales intelligence forecasting, all of these are areas within the product. So, huge kudos to the product team for keeping the pace of innovation that serves upmarket customers really well. In addition to that, our go-to-market side, the investments that we have made in upskilling our reps as well as the partner ecosystem is working. Our sales teams live and breathe in our product every single day. So it\u2019s very easy for the show Sales Hub demo and how that actually works with Marketing Hub and drives their own productivity and partners are very much enrolled in this journey of going upmarket. So look, the momentum really comes down to meeting the needs of our customers in this moment, and we\u2019re very happy with what we\u2019re seeing and how we are able to deliver for our customers.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Elizabeth Porter of Morgan Stanley. You may proceed.\nElizabeth Porter: Great. Thank you so much. I wanted to hit on the really impressive kind of net customer adds and get a better sense for where the incremental demand is coming from kind of beyond that initial expectation for around 7,000 a quarter. So are you seeing HubSpot actually displace other vendors? Or is there still a lot of greenfield deployments at the low end that you\u2019re landing and that can just how durable is this trend? Thank you.\nKate Bueker: Yes. Thanks, Elizabeth. I think in general, these are really small, early-stage companies that are, in large part, trying our free tools and converting from free tools into starter. And so I would think most of them are coming from a more greenfield place than HubSpot displacing someone else. If I look at the quarter-over-quarter trend in net customer adds, like we are obviously very excited about the 9,900 new ads. The vast majority of the increase quarter-over-quarter is coming at that starter tier. And there are a couple of things that are driving it. Yamini talked about the healthy volume we are seeing free sign-ups as a result of our strong top-of-funnel demand. We are also continuing to test pricing optimization levers as we do, frankly, on a regular basis, and that is also working. That said, like Q1 always has tended to be seasonally strong. I do not expect that we\u2019re going to stay at 9,000 customer ads, but we do feel good about net adds continuing to remain strong. I would advise 7,000 to 8,000 range over the next couple of quarters, with the biggest variable there being how to start addition pace.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Joshua Reilly of Needham & Company. Please proceed.\nJoshua Reilly: Hey, there. Thanks for taking my question. Nice job on the quarter here. Can you give us a sense of how the direct versus the partner business is performing over the last couple of quarters here? I think last year, you made the comment that the partner business was performing stronger into the downturn. And what are just the dynamics or additional color there? Thank you.\nYamini Rangan: Hey, Josh, thank you for the question. This is Yamini. Both direct and partner are executing as planned. We\u2019ve shared in the past that our strategy with a partner ecosystem is we want to be able to scale both selling as well as servicing with partners. And in the last couple of years, as we have gone up market and as we have really transitioned from being a marketing automation company to a CRM platform, we\u2019ve really spent a lot of time as well as energy and efforts with our partners to bring them along that journey. And that strategy is working. So as you look at like Q1, the partner ecosystem performed well. When you talk to partners, I know many of your top partners, you\u2019ll hear them talk about multi-hub deployments and as well as leading us a little bit upmarket. So they are helping us in that journey. And there is just a lot more joint co-selling. And if you step back and think about what do customer want, as they in this environment make decisions, they want high returns and low risk and therefore, jointly executing with partners and having clear migration implementation and change management plans are really working. The direct side is going along with that. And so there is still the healthy balance of about 40% of our installed base coming from our partners and the rest is from our direct and both are executing really well.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Rishi Jaluria of RBC. Please proceed.\nRishi Jaluria: Wonderful. Thank you so much for taking my question. Nice to see continued strong execution. I wanted to ask another generative AI question and kind of go back you do in your prepared remarks, you talked about the ability for people to business just to use generative AI on the back end to generate code. I want to think about from your perspective, how do you see your ability to use generative AI, maybe to iterate features and functionality faster and potentially narrow the gap with some of the upmarket players that maybe customers want to move on to HubSpot, but some of those features and functionality may be missing. Just how should we think about that? Thanks.\nDharmesh Shah: Yes. Thanks for that question, Rishi. This is Dharmesh. So a couple of things on generative AI with HubSpot. One is we\u2019re making the investment to make generative AI part of the HubSpot framework. That gives us two things. It gives us kind of short-term speed to market because all of our product teams can now benefit from the generative AI features we\u2019re building in the core platform, but we think has why to put the ability across the entire suite of application hubs within HubSpot. So that\u2019s what gets us to be really excited. And one thing that kind of gives us an advantage in terms of \u2013 versus other companies is that HubSpot grew up with an organically built for SMB platform where all the data is cohesively stored and normalized. And this becomes very, very important because in order to kind of get the value from generative AI, you need to be able to kind of use the existing data that you have. It\u2019s not about having tens of millions of records. It\u2019s about having all the data points on individual customers so you can provide context the generative AI models to say, we know we can web page do this customer in. We know how many times they interacted with us. We know if they have a support ticket in service hub or not. We know exactly all the sales interactions we have. We can take all of that context and use it for a generative AI model. And one of the benefits to companies like HubSpot that has this kind of very rapid iteration, get something in the hands of users, as I believe and the team believes that they who can actually get something in users\u2019 hands and get that feedback and have a very tight feedback loop are the ones that win. So we think generative AI levels the playing field in terms of the incumbents that are there. And we think HubSpot is uniquely position to kind of benefit from generative AI given our organic approach to building the platform and the way we track HubSpot framework and the primary colors.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Gabriela Borges of Goldman Sachs. You may proceed.\nGabriela Borges: Good afternoon. Thank you. I will stay on the generative AI topic either for Dharmesh or for Yamini. I wanted to follow-up on your comments on leveling the playing field. Do you think over the longer term, this leads to less crowdedness or less competition in the front office stack? And then I wanted to ask directly about the trade-off between efficiency and effectiveness, what are your thoughts on the potential bear case on if marketing people and salespeople become more productive and HubSpot has a seat-based model, how do you think about the risk that seats go down while you\u2019re monetizing incremental functionality on the way up, if that makes sense. Thank you.\nYamini Rangan: Great question, Gabriela. Thanks for that. Maybe I\u2019ll start, and then Dharmesh certainly feel free to join here. We do think of it as leveling the playing field, especially for SMBs. One of the things that we\u2019ve been very consistent about is taking powerful technologies, sophisticated technology and democratizing that for SMBs. And that\u2019s exactly what we are trying to do with generative AI. SMBs typically don\u2019t have large teams of AI experts sitting and we want to be able to bring it in with the same power and ease of use. And that will allow our customers to really compete effectively within the market. I think the second question you asked was really around how we think about effectiveness versus efficiency. And look, I think it\u2019s very hard to predict in the long-term or maybe even the next 3 to 5 years, what happens with a lot of the jobs. From our perspective, some jobs are going to become less relevant and more automated. At the same time, AI is probably going to create more jobs and new skills. It\u2019s a little too early to predict longer term. Having said that our belief is that AI will not replace humans. But humans who use AI will replace humans who don\u2019t use AI, and we\u2019re in the business of helping humans use AI much better and that\u2019s exactly what you\u2019re seeing in terms of our strategy. The first stage of our strategy is to help people to drive better outcomes, a lot more in terms of the effectiveness focus. And you can already see this happening with content assistant and ChatSpot and that\u2019s empowering our customers to drive better outcomes, not just like safe time. And the next stage is really taking generative AI and really making it applicable across our platform Dharmesh just talked about how we think about it from a framework perspective. It\u2019s like one of our primary colors and repeatable tasks can be commoditized and the real value is going to come from that last mile of human intelligence. So we are of the mindset that this is going to drive to better outcomes for everybody within the front office. Dharmesh, anything else that you would want to add?\nDharmesh Shah: Yes, I want to add just in terms of kind of the long-term view on generative AI overall. Right now, kind of 95% of the attention calories are in use cases where we take natural language and convert them to something that a human is going to consume, be it a block host or an image and we will eventually see video. And I think 95% of the opportunity for companies like HubSpot is actually using natural language comps and generative models to create codes met for computers. So we can look at examples like creating a report definition in HubSpot, creating a custom workflow action in Ops Hub, all these things where we can take things that were historically only acceptable to like a small percentage of the users within the company, and we can expand that now so that a larger portion of people can generate sophisticated reports and write custom workflow actions and do data cleansing and all these things. So just put power tools in the hands of many more customers. So we\u2019re just very excited about that kind of ability to kind of democratize and make things easy, which is what spot\u2019s always been known for.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The next question is from the line of Brent Bracelin of Piper Sandler. You may proceed.\nBrent Bracelin: Thank you. Good afternoon. Obviously, really impressed here with the number of net adds and into slight obviously a pretty challenging backdrop. I wanted to ask maybe a longer-term question around vendor consolidation, which feels like there is a longer-term tailwind here. You talked about one customer consolidating eight tools, down to the combo of Sales Hub and Marketing Hub. Where are we at in that cross hub cross-sell opportunity relative to the installed base. We\u2019re not quite seeing in ARPU yet given the volume increase we\u2019re seeing at the low end with starter but it feels like longer-term, there is opportunity. So could you just address vendor consolidation, how meaningful can that be as a PON looking out to \u201824, \u201825, \u201826? Thanks.\nYamini Rangan: Yes, it\u2019s a great question. And I do think this is a longer-term trend that we are beginning to see. And maybe if you kind of like step back and think about the last couple of years that our customers are come from. Our customers took a couple of different paths. Either they had a lot of point solutions, which becomes really hard to be able to manage both from a cost as well as the complexity of the overall tax perspective or they went with maybe legacy enterprise-class solutions and they have quoted themselves into a corner. And when I talk to customers now, they want something that is powerful, that is simple that provides the entire visibility across their customers journey and is cost effective. And if you look at HubSpot, we do all of that. This is why the strength in terms of customer addition, even in the current macro kind of like backdrop is not surprising because it is very clear that we are becoming a platform for SMBs as well as scaling companies. Now you asked the question of how to lay out, it\u2019s very early days when we look at our installed base as well as when we talk to prospects, it\u2019s pretty early days in this type of consolidation. And we want to build the best-in-class marketing sales service solutions that can drive value for customers. And so we\u2019re going to keep the pace of product innovation. And I think that we still have a long way to go in terms of seeing this consolidation play through.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Brad Sills of Bank of America. You may proceed.\nBrad Sills: Wonderful. Thanks for taking my question. Great start to the year here. I wanted to ask about Operations Hub. Yamini, you called it out as an area of strength. We are certainly hearing that from the channel, would love to get your perspective. To me, this seems like the platform. You are running two or more hubs. You need the glue to automate workflow across different hubs using Operation Hubs. Is that why you are starting to see the success now with Operations Hub? In other words, you are getting to the point where customers are running \u2013 more customers are running two or more hubs, they need that glue. Just any color on what\u2019s driving that Operations Hub strength?\nYamini Rangan: I love this question, Brad, and you actually gave the answer. We hit it on the head. It is that we are seeing a macro-driven front office unification. And I also think that Operations Hub is like the perfect glue that brings together marketing, sales, other hubs, but give the value, right. I mean if you really think about what it does, it brings data from multiple sources. It\u2019s able to automate like workflows and the better insights from just more sophisticated data sets. And so you hit the nail on the head in terms of why Operations Hub is seeing an attraction. Maybe a couple more points of color in terms of how our product efforts as well as go-to-market efforts have been in this area, we have expanded value for our customers, particularly around data quality. Now, late last year, we launched some major updates to Operations Hub capability, particularly around data quality and portability. And you may remember us talking about data quality command center that has been a pretty big hit with our pro and enterprise customers. In addition to that, we have also ramped up our own enablement efforts around advanced capabilities. Now, selling technical products like data warehouse connectors and custom code actions is always difficult. By the way, custom code actions and workflows is like one of my absolute favorite new features in Ops Hub, so much value for customers. But one of the things that we have done is like continue to enable our direct teams and partners to showcase the value of these sophisticated features. And so it\u2019s still super early innings in terms of Operations Hub, but it\u2019s on an exciting path, and I am very happy with the momentum that we saw in Q1.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Alex Zukin of Wolfe Research. You may proceed.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi guys. This is Ryan on for Alex. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on a great quarter. So, my question is around retention. At 104% this quarter, it did decelerate faster than last quarter and with the environment is still tough, what\u2019s your level of confidence that it can stay above 100%? And if that is the expectation, how are you thinking about when it could normalize? Thanks.\nKate Bueker: Yes. Thanks very much for the question. I think we have talked about this in the past. There is really types of retention or two pieces of retention that we pay a lot of attention to internally. Gross retention that we refer to as customer dollar and net revenue retention. Customer dollar retention, we continue to see general stability in customer dollar retention in the high-80s. We expect that gross retention is going to hang in, in that zone for that the rest of 2023. On the net revenue retention side, you are right, we did see a step down of 3 points from Q4 into Q1. And we are seeing that step down across all the same reasons that we have been talking about for the last few quarters, right. There is a pressure that we are seeing from our customers really optimizing their spend of HubSpot. That is particularly notable in contacts and seats. We are also seeing some of our multi-portal customers now leveraging some of the up-market features to consolidate their portals in HubSpot. In addition, we are seeing customers upgrading seats and contacts at a slower rate than we have in the past. And we think that we are going to continue to see those pressures going into Q2. But where we see \u2013 where we think that we are going to see some balances a couple of other trends, we continue to see solid trends in upgrading. You see the volumes from starter into professional at pretty consistent upgrade rates. We are seeing a bit of benefit from some of our recent pricing adjustments. And that in combination with the solid gross retention really in that high-80s is what gives us confidence that we can retain net revenue retention above 100 for 2023. Now, we still believe that 110 is the right benchmark for us in terms of net revenue retention over the long-term, but that\u2019s going to require a more normal macro environment.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Ken Wong of Oppenheimer. You may proceed.\nKen Wong: Great. Thanks for taking my question. This one is geared towards you, Kate. I believe last quarter, you characterized the macro environment is kind of not better, but not worse. As you exit Q1, I guess what\u2019s the right thinking in terms of what\u2019s baked into the outlook?\nKate Bueker: Yes. Thanks for the question. I tried to share in my prepared remarks, a bit of color around just that. The external environment really does remain difficult, and we assume that it remains difficult throughout 2023. That said, as you know, we have approached guidance in a very consistent way. We did the same thing in Q1 and really tried to set guidance that contemplates a whole variety of scenarios. Our baseline assumption is that the remainder of 2023 feels like Q1, it feels like the back half of last year. It\u2019s still early in the year, and the external environment has been really volatile. FX has been very volatile, and we want to deliver against guidance with that baseline assumption or even if things get a little bit worse.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Michael Turrin of Wells Fargo. You may proceed.\nMichael Turrin: Hey there. Thanks. Appreciate you taking the question. Look, there are so many good big picture questions I would like to ask, but I will go into a metrics question instead because it\u2019s something we are getting some questions on. There are some moving pieces in terms of currency with respect to the results and the change in assumptions on the guide. And so if we look at the Q1 number and the change in currency for the rest of the year, it looks like the second half constant currency assumptions for revenue might actually come down a touch on a constant currency basis. So, I just want to understand if that interpretation is accurate. And maybe just help us split out the currency movements versus just any fundamental change in what you are thinking through and contemplating with the rest of your guidance. Obviously, great job across the board on the Q1 results, just looking for some clarity there. Thanks.\nKate Bueker: Yes. Thank you. We executed, we are happy with the execution in Q1 despite the challenging macro. And as you pointed out, we raised the full year by the full amount of the Q1 beat, which I think does speak to the confidence that we have in the business. But as you heard from both Yamini and I, the macro remains challenging. It\u2019s very volatile, including FX. We are not out of the woods yet. And on top of that, we are still early in the year. And so we took all of this into account when we set the guidance for the year. Our philosophy on guidance remains the same. We are aiming to put out guidance that we have a high degree of confidence in being able to achieve across a variety of scenarios.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Brian Peterson of Raymond James. You may proceed.\nBrian Peterson: Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the strong quarter. So, I wanted to unpack what\u2019s driving the average revenue per customer higher? I know you kind of hit on that a little bit. But it\u2019s just amazing to see the net adds and that figure is still up 3% year-over-year. So, is the cross-sell sales cycles in the enterprise, are those actually getting better or vendor consolidation or ROI for customers? I would love to just maybe understand what\u2019s happening up-market that figure to be growing 3%.\nKate Bueker: Yes. Thank you again for that one. There is really two things happening in ASRPC, right. We continued to see multi-hub adoption broadly across our professional and enterprise customers. And that is offset by sort of the volume that we are seeing at the low end. If we just look at professional and enterprise, ASRPC continued to be up double digits in constant currency in Q1. It\u2019s the headwind from the volume of starter customers that is moving the ASRPC from that sort of double-digit level to 6% in constant currency.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Arjun Bhatia of William Blair. You may proceed.\nArjun Bhatia: Perfect. Thanks for taking the questions. Kate, maybe another one from you \u2013 for you. I am just trying to reconcile a little bit the comment about upgrades still happening, right, customers wanting more capabilities, more features versus there is still being some headwinds around optimization, seats, contacts, etcetera. Is there any kind of characteristics amongst those customers that you can point out that maybe we could hang on to where you are seeing a specific vertical or a specific customer size, do one versus the other?\nKate Bueker: Yes. I mean it\u2019s a good question. These are not new trends for us. We have been seeing the same type of pressure and dynamics within our customer base over the last few quarters. And what we are seeing is a focus initiative to get the most out of their spend with HubSpot. Well, I don\u2019t believe we are alone in that. And that for us comes in the form of them cleaning up their contacts, cleaning up unused seats. It comes in consolidating when they are on multiple portals, consolidate and using all the features that they have signed up for. That doesn\u2019t mean that our customers are continuing to use more of our products. But what we are seeing more and more is that is an offset. They are doing the cleanup in conjunction with the expansion.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Parker Lane of Stifel. You may proceed.\nParker Lane: Yes. Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Circling back to the partner ecosystem, Yamini, I know you made some changes there earlier this year around compensation levels of partners and what they need to do to continue the relationship financially with HubSpot. You want them selling and servicing partners. Do you expect there is going to be some consolidation in that channel in 2023, 2024? And then what exactly are you guys doing behind the scenes to up-skill those partners to get them in a position to be more effectively servicing the customer base? Thanks.\nYamini Rangan: Hey Parker. Yes. Thanks a lot for the question. I think maybe two parts there. I will first start with the changes that we made and then answer the second part of the question. I am really pleased with the response from the partner channel. And since the announcement and even before the announcement, I have spent a lot of time talking to our partners, meet diamond [ph] partners in terms of them change. And just to step back, we really looked at our partner commissions, and we are incentivizing our partners to have more consistent engagements with our customers to sell and cross-sell more with us and to do more multi-hub. And the partners understand they why behind the change, and we are also giving partners a lot of time to be able to adapt which they appreciate. And so, at the end of the day, the changes that we made are going to be a win for our customers and therefore, good for our partners as well as HubSpot. And at the margin, we are actually seeing some of the partners increase their engagement with our customers as a result of this. The second part of the question is, do we think it\u2019s going to lead to some level of consolidation, how do we enable the partners, I think it will. And it\u2019s not necessarily because of the commission changes, but it\u2019s because we are moving up-market, and we are guiding our partners to be able to scale to better serve the needs of up-market customers. And as we do that, we are definitely beginning to notice that partners are either already consolidating or figuring out ways to scale. And therefore, the percentage from elite partners from top partners is probably going to increase as we continue the transition to driving multi-hub as well as serving the needs of up-market customers. And our focus on partner enablement is really high. We have been really on this journey to enroll them to drive more certifications. There is an upcoming certification week that\u2019s coming up for our partners, and we are putting a lot behind that, and we will continue to drive the level of technical capabilities within the partner ecosystem. Overall, really happy with the response and where our partner ecosystem is going.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Terry Tillman of Truist. You may proceed.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. Thanks so much for taking the question and congrats on the quarter. This is Bobby De on for Terry. Curious what you are seeing globally in terms of strength or weakness across geographies? Thanks.\nYamini Rangan: Hey Bobby. Thanks a lot for that. Overall, fairly consistent in terms of what we are seeing in North America as well as our international markets. As Kate just mentioned, international is about 46% of our overall base and growing reasonably well. There is not that much of a divergence in terms of the trends. What we see in terms of the longer deal cycles and more decision makers is across North America and international. And what we see in terms of the reasons why our customers want HubSpot is also consistent. We deliver quick time to value, which is what is important across all customers. And most of the time, value is in a matter of weeks, not months or quarters. And customers really care about their costs and they are consolidating with fewer platforms. And so we see a lot more platform consolidation and multi-hub conversations, both in regional as well as international markets. And there is kind of a high bar to action across all customers, but we are executing in both markets with consistency.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Michael Turits of KeyCorp. You may proceed.\nMichael Turits: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Great quarter. I wanted to ask about the move-up market and how you are approaching from the direct channel \u2013 direct sales force perspective? This is a year in which you are increasing margins, and you have had a RIF. But \u2013 so what are you doing in terms of investing in the direct sales channel to drive more engagement? And how are you managing the costs on that?\nYamini Rangan: Yes. Thanks a lot for the question. Maybe I will start with up-market and what we are doing with the sales team and Kate, feel free to add in terms of the costs there. If we step back and think about why up-market is working and what is up-market for HubSpot, we are still very, very focused on the 2 to 2,000 employee segment. And for us, up-market is the 200 to 2,000 employee segment. And if you think about customers there, they care deeply about cost savings within this environment, and they care deeply about navigating the macro while driving resilient growth and HubSpot helps with both of those. We are powerful solution that\u2019s still very, very easy to use and easy to implement, and that\u2019s what is resonating within up-market. As we have thought about our own sales teams and internally driving the efficiency, we have talked about this. We are driving more data into the hands of our direct sales reps. We are arming them with the right kind of total cost of ownership as well as value messaging. This is the tightest level of alignment I have seen between products, marketing and sales in terms of the key messages that we are delivering and our teams are very, very focused. And so I think from an internal standpoint, systems, automation, messaging alignment are all in favor of driving consistent execution there.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Taylor McGinnis of UBS. You may proceed.\nTaylor McGinnis: Hi. Thanks so much for squeezing me in and congrats on a really great quarter. The 1Q margin performance was really strong, particularly sequentially. So, are you able to break that down and quantify the drivers of the uplift? Like how much was on restructuring or hiring and efficiencies in the business, just to help us think about the future margin trajectory and the durability of the progress that we are seeing?\nKate Bueker: Yes. Taylor, it was a really good question. The margin upside in Q1 versus our expectation is primarily related to the restructuring. So, revenue came in a little bit better than expectations on some favorable FX rates. But we, frankly, underestimated the impact the restructuring would have on our overall hiring plan and resulted in really a delay in returning to our regularly planned hiring cadence. That said, we are feeling really good about where we are now. What this means is we expect to sort of return to that normal seasonal pattern in our operating margins from this point on through 2023. Q2 margins are going to decline slightly. It\u2019s a typical sequential pattern for us with annual merit increases and a return to the investment in hiring as well as some hybrid connection. That said, we will expect that operating margins are going to expand through the back half of the year with low-double digits in Q3 and high teens in Q4, consistent with what we provided last quarter.\nOperator: Thank you. And with that, we will conclude our time of question-and-answer. I would now like to hand the conference back over to Yamini Rangan, CEO, for any closing remarks.\nYamini Rangan: Thank you so much for all the engaged questions as well as the support and look forward to connecting back again in a few months. Mike?\nOperator: And with that, we will conclude today\u2019s call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect your line.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Dharmesh Shah",
            "content": "Yes. Thanks for that question, Rishi. This is Dharmesh. So a couple of things on generative AI with HubSpot. One is we're making the investment to make generative AI part of the HubSpot framework. That gives us two things. It gives us kind of short-term speed to market because all of our product teams can now benefit from the generative AI features we're building in the core platform, but we think has why to put the ability across the entire suite of application hubs within HubSpot. So that's what gets us to be really excited. And one thing that kind of gives us an advantage in terms of \u2013 versus other companies is that HubSpot grew up with an organically built for SMB platform where all the data is cohesively stored and normalized. And this becomes very, very important because in order to kind of get the value from generative AI, you need to be able to kind of use the existing data that you have. It's not about having tens of millions of records. It's about having all the data points on individual customers so you can provide context the generative AI models to say, we know we can web page do this customer in. We know how many times they interacted with us. We know if they have a support ticket in service hub or not. We know exactly all the sales interactions we have. We can take all of that context and use it for a generative AI model. And one of the benefits to companies like HubSpot that has this kind of very rapid iteration, get something in the hands of users, as I believe and the team believes that they who can actually get something in users' hands and get that feedback and have a very tight feedback loop are the ones that win. So we think generative AI levels the playing field in terms of the incumbents that are there. And we think HubSpot is uniquely position to kind of benefit from generative AI given our organic approach to building the platform and the way we track HubSpot framework and the primary colors. Yes, I want to add just in terms of kind of the long-term view on generative AI overall. Right now, kind of 95% of the attention calories are in use cases where we take natural language and convert them to something that a human is going to consume, be it a block host or an image and we will eventually see video. And I think 95% of the opportunity for companies like HubSpot is actually using natural language comps and generative models to create codes met for computers. So we can look at examples like creating a report definition in HubSpot, creating a custom workflow action in Ops Hub, all these things where we can take things that were historically only acceptable to like a small percentage of the users within the company, and we can expand that now so that a larger portion of people can generate sophisticated reports and write custom workflow actions and do data cleansing and all these things. So just put power tools in the hands of many more customers. So we're just very excited about that kind of ability to kind of democratize and make things easy, which is what spot's always been known for."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Kate Bueker",
            "content": "Thanks, Yamini. Let's turn to our Q1 2023 financial results. Revenue grew 30% year-over-year in constant currency and 27% on an as-reported basis. Subscription revenue grew 27% year-over-year, while services and other revenue increased 12% on an as-reported basis. Domestic revenue grew 27% year-over-year, while international revenue growth was 33% in constant currency and 26% as reported. International revenue represented 46% of total revenue. . We added over 9,900 net new customers in the quarter, bringing our total customer count to over 177,000, up 23% year-over-year. Starter customer acquisition continued to fuel our strong net adds again in Q1. Average subscription revenue per customer grew 6% year-over-year in constant currency and 3% on an as-reported basis to $11,400. Our ASRPC growth was driven by continued multi-hub adoption by our professional and enterprise customers, offset by the large volume of starter customers we added at the low end of our bimodal strategy. Gross retention remained healthy in the high 80s for the quarter. Net revenue retention was 104%, down 3 points sequentially, driven by further customer optimization of HubSpot spend as well as slower expansion across seats, contact tiers and portals. While we expect pressure on net revenue retention in the near term to persist, we continue to believe we can maintain net revenue retention above 100%. Calculated billings were $533 million in the quarter, growing 28% year-over-year in constant currency and 26% as reported. The remainder of my comments will refer to non-GAAP measures. Operating margin was 13%, up 4 points compared to the year ago period. Operating margins benefited from restructuring actions we implemented at the end of January, which impacted our head count and facilities costs, including a temporary pause in overall hiring in Q1. Net income was $62 million or $1.20 per fully diluted share. Free cash flow was $85 million or 17% of revenue, and our cash and marketable securities totaled $1.6 billion at the end of March. And with that, let's review our guidance for the second quarter and full year of 2023. As Yamini highlighted, we continue to operate in a difficult macro environment with customer behavior that is similar to what we saw in the second half of 2022. Budgets are tight, decision by committee has become the norm, and customers are spending cautiously on new products while looking for ways to optimize existing spend. Our guidance assumes that these weak macroeconomic conditions persist throughout 2023. For the second quarter, total as reported revenue is expected to be in the range of $503 million to $505 million, up 19% year-over-year at the midpoint. We expect foreign exchange to be about a point of headwind to as reported revenue growth in the quarter. Non-GAAP operating profit is expected to be between $54 million and $56 million. Non-GAAP diluted net income per share is expected to be between $0.98 and $1. This assumes 52.4 million fully diluted shares outstanding. And for the full year of 2023, total as reported revenue is now expected to be in the range of $2.08 billion to $2.088 billion, up 20% year-over-year at the midpoint. Non-GAAP operating profit is now expected to be between $275 million and $279 million. We now expect foreign exchange to have a neutral impact to as reported revenue and operating profit margin for the full year of 2023. Non-GAAP diluted net income per share is now expected to be between $4.80 and $4.85. This assumes 52.3 million fully diluted shares outstanding. As you adjust your models, keep in mind the following: we expect CapEx as a percentage of revenue to be roughly 5% and free cash flow to be about $245 million for the full year of 2023, with seasonally stronger free cash flow in Q4. And with that, I will hand things back over to Yamini for her closing remarks. Yes. Sure thing. Thanks, Mark. I think there is a lot of reasons to really love the strategy of our product-led growth. I would not say that increased visibility over the long-term is one of them. That said, it's a really great low-cost way to get lots of customers using HubSpot really early in their business life cycle. And we think it creates a lot of interesting dynamics over and above just the economics, which I can talk about. It creates a nice moat, a competitive for us against low-end disruption, it also enhances pretty dramatically the value of our overall platform just based on the scale of customers at the low end. Now some portion of those starter customers will upgrade to Pro and Enterprise over time. I think you already know that. Oftentimes, that happens with a bit of a faster sales cycle that we also like. But this is really just one of many motions that will drive our growth over time. Yes. Thanks, Elizabeth. I think in general, these are really small, early-stage companies that are, in large part, trying our free tools and converting from free tools into starter. And so I would think most of them are coming from a more greenfield place than HubSpot displacing someone else. If I look at the quarter-over-quarter trend in net customer adds, like we are obviously very excited about the 9,900 new ads. The vast majority of the increase quarter-over-quarter is coming at that starter tier. And there are a couple of things that are driving it. Yamini talked about the healthy volume we are seeing free sign-ups as a result of our strong top-of-funnel demand. We are also continuing to test pricing optimization levers as we do, frankly, on a regular basis, and that is also working. That said, like Q1 always has tended to be seasonally strong. I do not expect that we're going to stay at 9,000 customer ads, but we do feel good about net adds continuing to remain strong. I would advise 7,000 to 8,000 range over the next couple of quarters, with the biggest variable there being how to start addition pace. Yes. Thanks very much for the question. I think we have talked about this in the past. There is really types of retention or two pieces of retention that we pay a lot of attention to internally. Gross retention that we refer to as customer dollar and net revenue retention. Customer dollar retention, we continue to see general stability in customer dollar retention in the high-80s. We expect that gross retention is going to hang in, in that zone for that the rest of 2023. On the net revenue retention side, you are right, we did see a step down of 3 points from Q4 into Q1. And we are seeing that step down across all the same reasons that we have been talking about for the last few quarters, right. There is a pressure that we are seeing from our customers really optimizing their spend of HubSpot. That is particularly notable in contacts and seats. We are also seeing some of our multi-portal customers now leveraging some of the up-market features to consolidate their portals in HubSpot. In addition, we are seeing customers upgrading seats and contacts at a slower rate than we have in the past. And we think that we are going to continue to see those pressures going into Q2. But where we see \u2013 where we think that we are going to see some balances a couple of other trends, we continue to see solid trends in upgrading. You see the volumes from starter into professional at pretty consistent upgrade rates. We are seeing a bit of benefit from some of our recent pricing adjustments. And that in combination with the solid gross retention really in that high-80s is what gives us confidence that we can retain net revenue retention above 100 for 2023. Now, we still believe that 110 is the right benchmark for us in terms of net revenue retention over the long-term, but that's going to require a more normal macro environment. Yes. Thanks for the question. I tried to share in my prepared remarks, a bit of color around just that. The external environment really does remain difficult, and we assume that it remains difficult throughout 2023. That said, as you know, we have approached guidance in a very consistent way. We did the same thing in Q1 and really tried to set guidance that contemplates a whole variety of scenarios. Our baseline assumption is that the remainder of 2023 feels like Q1, it feels like the back half of last year. It's still early in the year, and the external environment has been really volatile. FX has been very volatile, and we want to deliver against guidance with that baseline assumption or even if things get a little bit worse. Yes. Thank you. We executed, we are happy with the execution in Q1 despite the challenging macro. And as you pointed out, we raised the full year by the full amount of the Q1 beat, which I think does speak to the confidence that we have in the business. But as you heard from both Yamini and I, the macro remains challenging. It's very volatile, including FX. We are not out of the woods yet. And on top of that, we are still early in the year. And so we took all of this into account when we set the guidance for the year. Our philosophy on guidance remains the same. We are aiming to put out guidance that we have a high degree of confidence in being able to achieve across a variety of scenarios. Yes. Thank you again for that one. There is really two things happening in ASRPC, right. We continued to see multi-hub adoption broadly across our professional and enterprise customers. And that is offset by sort of the volume that we are seeing at the low end. If we just look at professional and enterprise, ASRPC continued to be up double digits in constant currency in Q1. It's the headwind from the volume of starter customers that is moving the ASRPC from that sort of double-digit level to 6% in constant currency. Yes. I mean it's a good question. These are not new trends for us. We have been seeing the same type of pressure and dynamics within our customer base over the last few quarters. And what we are seeing is a focus initiative to get the most out of their spend with HubSpot. Well, I don't believe we are alone in that. And that for us comes in the form of them cleaning up their contacts, cleaning up unused seats. It comes in consolidating when they are on multiple portals, consolidate and using all the features that they have signed up for. That doesn't mean that our customers are continuing to use more of our products. But what we are seeing more and more is that is an offset. They are doing the cleanup in conjunction with the expansion. Yes. Taylor, it was a really good question. The margin upside in Q1 versus our expectation is primarily related to the restructuring.

            "name": "Yamini Rangan",
            "content": "Thank you so much, Chuck and welcome to everyone joining us on the call. Today, I want to focus on our start to 2023, share observations on the current macro environment and provide some perspective on what generative AI means for HubSpot and our customers. Let's start with our Q1 results. We had a solid start to the year with revenue growing 30% in constant currency year-over-year. We delivered more than 4 points of margin expansion year-over-year, bringing operating margins to over 13%. Total customers grew by 23% to over 177,000 customers globally, fueled by net customer additions of over 9,900 in the quarter. I'm pleased with our momentum coming into the year and the focused execution by the HubSpot team. These results show that our product innovation is in high gear and that our bimodal go-to-market strategy is working. Our focus with our bimodal strategy remains clear. We want to drive volume at the lower end of the market while driving increased value upmarket. In Q1, we continue to gain momentum in both segments of the market. On the lower end, we saw a significant uptick in our net customer additions. This was driven by strength in free sign-ups and pricing optimization plays we ran in our starter edition. In addition to that, HubSpot is powerful, yet easy to use, and we are increasingly becoming the platform of choice for scaling companies. Looking up market, we continue to see our multi-hub value proposition resonating. More professional and enterprise customers are starting with multiple hubs and over 45% of our ARR installed base is now on 3 or more hubs. Upmarket customers are increasingly looking for two things: a single source of truth that provides full visibility across their entire customer journey and clear cost savings in this environment. HubSpot's connected platform delivers both. Specifically, Sales Hub continued to gain momentum in Q1 as customers look to build tighter alignment between marketing and sales to drive more efficiency across the front office. Take Liquidity Services a B2B e-commerce marketplace, as an example. After adopting Sales Hub and Marketing comp, they were able to eliminate 8 other tools, reducing their overall cost by 50%. They were able to connect their marketing and sales data to get better insights and drive an increase in their conversions and campaign effectiveness. This is a great example of our customers, driving growth with multi-hub, while saving time and budget. We also saw Operations Hub come up in more deals as customers focused on consolidation. They see the clear value of a solution that can connect systems, automate processes and demonstrate value, especially in this economic environment. In fact, over two-thirds of our top 25 deals closed in Q1 adopted Ops Hub, leveraging multiple hubs boost efficiency and I am excited by the value our customers are seeing from our connected platform. As you can see, our bimodal strategy is working, and we will continue to maintain our pace of product innovation. Next, I want to shift gears and share what we're seeing in the macro environment. Overall, we continue to operate in a tough environment and we are not out of the woods yet. While we see our top-of-funnel activity improving, sales cycles remain long and budgets remain under scrutiny. These patients by committee have become the norm with multiple executives involved in sales cycles. It is clear based on my conversations with customers that they're continuing to tighten their belts in terms of budget, and we can see this in optimization across seats, contact tiers and portals. Decision-makers are focused on budget optimization and continue to spend cautiously. Now despite these challenges, we have a solid playbook for executing and driving sustainable growth. We remain focused on product innovation and consistent execution. On the product side, we're cranking. One of our strategic objectives is to become the market share leader in marketing, sales and service for scaling companies and we remain focused on delivering depth of features in order to get there. In Q1, with Marketing Hub, we moved customer journey analytics to general availability and the strong adoption and usage we're seeing gives me confidence that we are driving meaningful innovation that serves marketeers needs today. With Sales Hub, we significantly enhanced the sequences tools for upmarket customers with selective treating and advanced permissioning and removed generative AI e-mail functionality to beta. We also launched a key Service Hub Enterprise feature with multiple knowledge bases. This has been a top product request from upmarket customers who need to be able to support various audiences, products or brands. And in payments and commerce, we introduced dual subscriptions and moved payable invoices to private beta. I'm thrilled with the progress we are making on our journey to become the number one CRM for scaling companies. On the go-to-market side, our strategy has been to focus on total cost of ownership for customers and communicating the value of HubSpot. Our quick time to value and connected platform message is clearly resonating as customers look to become more effective and efficient. We are driving enablement across both our direct and partner channels and we are keenly focused on value-centric conversations. Looking ahead, we'll continue to navigate this macro environment by following our playbook to drive product innovation and consistent strong execution. Now I want to double click on innovation and share how we're thinking about generative AI and why we are well positioned to add even more value for our customers. We are in the early stages of a transformative shift. Generative AI is rapidly changing the landscape in 3 fundamental ways. It helps businesses generate content, generate insights and generate code, all using natural language. This will be a massive opportunity for SMBs and scaling companies. Activities that once took them time, money and deep expertise no longer do with Gen AI. And this shift will enable SMBs to reach more customers, serve them at record speed with unprecedented relevance. So what does this really mean for marketing sales and service professionals? In the simplest terms, we believe AI will guide go-to-market teams and make them more effective. This will fuel a new era of AI guided growth for our customers. When we bring together the power of foundational models with the deep contextual data in HubSpot CRM, we can help go-to-market teams drive better results. Marketers can use Gen AI to guide them in creating more effective block poles, e-mail campaigns and social content. Salespeople can use it to guide them to write better prospecting e-mail and deliver more relevant insights for customers and service professionals can use Gen AI to anticipate customer needs, suggest resolutions and offer proactive support. We believe AI won't replace go-to-market teams. It will guide them to drive better outcomes. While there will be efficiency benefits, we're even more excited about effectiveness gains and the ability to drive guided growth for customers. While we are in the early stages of Gen AI, HubSpot has unique differentiators. First, we have unique data and broad distribution. HubSpot CRM data is unified and cohesive making it easier for AI to ingest and drive relevance. Second, we're at the center of our customers' workflows. HubSpot is where work gets done. So we can bring relevance to generate content and insights across the entire front office. We're not another AI point solution. We are an all-in-one CRM platform powered by AI. Third, we have always had a human-centric approach in companies with a human feedback loop or at an advantage with AI. We made a ton of progress in Q1 with the launches of content assistant in public beta and chat spot in public alpha. Since our launch in March, we've had over 40,000 users sign up for ChatSpot, and the early feedback has been very positive. Content Assistant has thousands of users to date, and we are seeing customers leveraging it daily for creating marketing e-mails, blog posts, landing pages and more. We're ambitiously integrating AI across our entire CRM platform. So our customers don't have to become AI expert to reap the transformational benefits. I am incredibly excited that the opportunity AI is creating to deliver even more value for our customers. Reflecting on the quarter, I am pleased with the progress we made on our path to becoming a CRM platform of choice for scaling companies. Our teams maintained the pace of product innovation and drove strong execution, which was just fantastic to see. With that, I'll turn the call over to Kate to take you through Q1 results in more detail. Thank you so much, Kate. I want to close with our commitment to driving durable, profitable growth long term. Looking ahead, we remain focused on foundational investments that will help us scale. As I shared during our last earnings call, we are doubling down on better development and high performance, better hybrid connection for our people, employees all over the world and better systems and automation internally. These initiatives will enable us to drive more efficiency long term and deliver even more value for our customers. I believe we have the right strategy and the right team to navigate this environment and emerge stronger. I want to thank our customers, our employees, our partners and our shareholders for the continued support on this journey. With that, operator, let's open up the call for questions. Hey, Keith. Thanks a lot for your question. This is Yamini. Very excited about generative AI. It is very transformative. And if you kind of like step back HubSpot got started when there was a fairly big shift that was happening in how people buy. And that led to us coming up and helping customers on how to market and sell. And we think generative AI is as transformative. And this is going to really cause our customers to think about how they market and sell. And so we think there is a lot of exciting potential. In terms of the monetization question, we have a very clear first principle when it comes to monetization. We focus on delivering customer value first and from there on, monetization will follow. And we think that this is pretty early days in terms of monetizing. Having said that, we are iterating fast, we are getting tons of feedback, especially with ChatSpot as well as content assistant that we just talked about and we are improving these use cases so we can continue to innovate for our customers and really help them get much more value with this transformative technology. As we do this, some of the features are just going to become table stakes. They will just be part of our core products and part of how we drive customer engagement and adoption within the core product. Now, if there are more specialized use cases, then maybe it goes into higher value additions like co and enterprise and will increase our ASP longer term, and that's how we're thinking about monetization. First, we want to focus on delivering value for the product. You asked the last question, which was when do we plan to get this into the hands of customers? Well, we launched pretty quickly within the market in March. It's alpha and data. We're getting a lot of the feedback and the teams are pretty excited. We are having a lot of Hackathon internally, and there is a long list of use cases that our teams are working on. So I think you'll see us maintain and even accelerate our pace of innovation, where we will be introducing features in weeks, not months or quarters. So lots of exciting developments here. Hey, Mark, I'll get started with the question and then Kate can answer. I love that question because it really gets to the heart of our strategy. When HubSpot got started, we had the deep conviction that we want to add as much value for our customers as possible and continue to get the most adoption from small, medium as well as scaling businesses and the free tools is really part of that strategy to get the widest possible top of the funnel. And by the way, the free tools have a ton of value. I mean \u2013 you talked about free CMS. That adds a lot of value in a company getting a digital presence and getting started. There are a number of other growth tools. And that's clearly the strategy and tying this maybe to something that I just talked about, which is the bimodal strategy. When you have a really wide funnel, which is what free tools like this creates then we work to continue to deliver value. And so the number of starter customers and the conversion from free sign-ups to pay customers increases. And we've been looking at this over the past few quarters. We're very happy with how that conversion continues to happen. And even from our starter customers, how they continue to get value in terms of pro and enterprise. So it's really our strategy for delivering value that works. And Kate, maybe you want to address the second part of the question there. Thank you, Samad for that question. We're really happy with Sales Hub as well as what it unlocks up market. And I think Marketing Hub is $1 billion-plus kind of product line that's got the ability to go to multibillion and Sales Hub is a $500 million-plus business that can grow into multiple billions, and both of them are kind of going at plan. We're super happy with that. Now specifically looking at Sales Hub, we've been on the steady march over the past few years to build the functionality that a true upmarket business needs to have as a system of record. And I think we've reached that point. We have hit that critical mass for an upmarket customer. We are a viable alternative to other legacy enterprise actions within the market and Sales Hub is now a legitimate front door to HubSpot. And this is a couple of reasons, right? On the product side, we're now serving larger customers and more sophisticated use cases. The steady drumbeat of product releases that you've been hearing from us are just all aimed at expanding our upmarket TAM, and these are custom objects and CRM customization, deeper permissioning, more features for admin. All of that is working. In addition to that, over the last couple of quarters, we're also adding our ability to serve more sophisticated use cases, right? I just talked about sequencing. That's something upmarket customers have needed much more ability to do in addition to that sales intelligence forecasting, all of these are areas within the product. So, huge kudos to the product team for keeping the pace of innovation that serves upmarket customers really well. In addition to that, our go-to-market side, the investments that we have made in upskilling our reps as well as the partner ecosystem is working. Our sales teams live and breathe in our product every single day. So it's very easy for the show Sales Hub demo and how that actually works with Marketing Hub and drives their own productivity and partners are very much enrolled in this journey of going upmarket. So look, the momentum really comes down to meeting the needs of our customers in this moment, and we're very happy with what we're seeing and how we are able to deliver for our customers. Hey, Josh, thank you for the question. This is Yamini. Both direct and partner are executing as planned. We've shared in the past that our strategy with a partner ecosystem is we want to be able to scale both selling as well as servicing with partners. And in the last couple of years, as we have gone up market and as we have really transitioned from being a marketing automation company to a CRM platform, we've really spent a lot of time as well as energy and efforts with our partners to bring them along that journey. And that strategy is working. So as you look at like Q1, the partner ecosystem performed well. When you talk to partners, I know many of your top partners, you'll hear them talk about multi-hub deployments and as well as leading us a little bit upmarket. So they are helping us in that journey. And there is just a lot more joint co-selling. And if you step back and think about what do customer want, as they in this environment make decisions, they want high returns and low risk and therefore, jointly executing with partners and having clear migration implementation and change management plans are really working. The direct side is going along with that. And so there is still the healthy balance of about 40% of our installed base coming from our partners and the rest is from our direct and both are executing really well. Great question, Gabriela. Thanks for that. Maybe I'll start, and then Dharmesh certainly feel free to join here. We do think of it as leveling the playing field, especially for SMBs. One of the things that we've been very consistent about is taking powerful technologies, sophisticated technology and democratizing that for SMBs. And that's exactly what we are trying to do with generative AI. SMBs typically don't have large teams of AI experts sitting and we want to be able to bring it in with the same power and ease of use. And that will allow our customers to really compete effectively within the market. I think the second question you asked was really around how we think about effectiveness versus efficiency. And look, I think it's very hard to predict in the long-term or maybe even the next 3 to 5 years, what happens with a lot of the jobs. From our perspective, some jobs are going to become less relevant and more automated. At the same time, AI is probably going to create more jobs and new skills. It's a little too early to predict longer term. Having said that our belief is that AI will not replace humans. But humans who use AI will replace humans who don't use AI, and we're in the business of helping humans use AI much better and that's exactly what you're seeing in terms of our strategy. The first stage of our strategy is to help people to drive better outcomes, a lot more in terms of the effectiveness focus. And you can already see this happening with content assistant and ChatSpot and that's empowering our customers to drive better outcomes, not just like safe time. And the next stage is really taking generative AI and really making it applicable across our platform Dharmesh just talked about how we think about it from a framework perspective. It's like one of our primary colors and repeatable tasks can be commoditized and the real value is going to come from that last mile of human intelligence. So we are of the mindset that this is going to drive to better outcomes for everybody within the front office. Dharmesh, anything else that you would want to add? Yes, it's a great question. And I do think this is a longer-term trend that we are beginning to see. And maybe if you kind of like step back and think about the last couple of years that our customers are come from. Our customers took a couple of different paths. Either they had a lot of point solutions, which becomes really hard to be able to manage both from a cost as well as the complexity of the overall tax perspective or they went with maybe legacy enterprise-class solutions and they have quoted themselves into a corner. And when I talk to customers now, they want something that is powerful, that is simple that provides the entire visibility across their customers journey and is cost effective. And if you look at HubSpot, we do all of that. This is why the strength in terms of customer addition, even in the current macro kind of like backdrop is not surprising because it is very clear that we are becoming a platform for SMBs as well as scaling companies. Now you asked the question of how to lay out, it's very early days when we look at our installed base as well as when we talk to prospects, it's pretty early days in this type of consolidation. And we want to build the best-in-class marketing sales service solutions that can drive value for customers. And so we're going to keep the pace of product innovation. And I think that we still have a long way to go in terms of seeing this consolidation play through. I love this question, Brad, and you actually gave the answer. We hit it on the head. It is that we are seeing a macro-driven front office unification. And I also think that Operations Hub is like the perfect glue that brings together marketing, sales, other hubs, but give the value, right. I mean if you really think about what it does, it brings data from multiple sources. It's able to automate like workflows and the better insights from just more sophisticated data sets. And so you hit the nail on the head in terms of why Operations Hub is seeing an attraction. Maybe a couple more points of color in terms of how our product efforts as well as go-to-market efforts have been in this area, we have expanded value for our customers, particularly around data quality. Now, late last year, we launched some major updates to Operations Hub capability, particularly around data quality and portability. And you may remember us talking about data quality command center that has been a pretty big hit with our pro and enterprise customers. In addition to that, we have also ramped up our own enablement efforts around advanced capabilities. Now, selling technical products like data warehouse connectors and custom code actions is always difficult. By the way, custom code actions and workflows is like one of my absolute favorite new features in Ops Hub, so much value for customers. But one of the things that we have done is like continue to enable our direct teams and partners to showcase the value of these sophisticated features. And so it's still super early innings in terms of Operations Hub, but it's on an exciting path, and I am very happy with the momentum that we saw in Q1. Hey Parker. Yes. Thanks a lot for the question. I think maybe two parts there. I will first start with the changes that we made and then answer the second part of the question. I am really pleased with the response from the partner channel. And since the announcement and even before the announcement, I have spent a lot of time talking to our partners, meet diamond [ph] partners in terms of them change. And just to step back, we really looked at our partner commissions, and we are incentivizing our partners to have more consistent engagements with our customers to sell and cross-sell more with us and to do more multi-hub. And the partners understand they why behind the change, and we are also giving partners a lot of time to be able to adapt which they appreciate. And so, at the end of the day, the changes that we made are going to be a win for our customers and therefore, good for our partners as well as HubSpot. And at the margin, we are actually seeing some of the partners increase their engagement with our customers as a result of this. The second part of the question is, do we think it's going to lead to some level of consolidation, how do we enable the partners, I think it will. And it's not necessarily because of the commission changes, but it's because we are moving up-market, and we are guiding our partners to be able to scale to better serve the needs of up-market customers. And as we do that, we are definitely beginning to notice that partners are either already consolidating or figuring out ways to scale. And therefore, the percentage from elite partners from top partners is probably going to increase as we continue the transition to driving multi-hub as well as serving the needs of up-market customers. And our focus on partner enablement is really high. We have been really on this journey to enroll them to drive more certifications. There is an upcoming certification week that's coming up for our partners, and we are putting a lot behind that, and we will continue to drive the level of technical capabilities within the partner ecosystem. Overall, really happy with the response and where our partner ecosystem is going. Hey Bobby. Thanks a lot for that. Overall, fairly consistent in terms of what we are seeing in North America as well as our international markets. As Kate just mentioned, international is about 46% of our overall base and growing reasonably well. There is not that much of a divergence in terms of the trends. What we see in terms of the longer deal cycles and more decision makers is across North America and international. And what we see in terms of the reasons why our customers want HubSpot is also consistent. We deliver quick time to value, which is what is important across all customers. And most of the time, value is in a matter of weeks, not months or quarters. And customers really care about their costs and they are consolidating with fewer platforms. And so we see a lot more platform consolidation and multi-hub conversations, both in regional as well as international markets. And there is kind of a high bar to action across all customers, but we are executing in both markets with consistency. Yes. Thanks a lot for the question. Maybe I will start with up-market and what we are doing with the sales team and Kate, feel free to add in terms of the costs there. If we step back and think about why up-market is working and what is up-market for HubSpot, we are still very, very focused on the 2 to 2,000 employee segment. And for us, up-market is the 200 to 2,000 employee segment. And if you think about customers there, they care deeply about cost savings within this environment, and they care deeply about navigating the macro while driving resilient growth and HubSpot helps with both of those. We are powerful solution that's still very, very easy to use and easy to implement, and that's what is resonating within up-market. As we have thought about our own sales teams and internally driving the efficiency, we have talked about this. We are driving more data into the hands of our direct sales reps. We are arming them with the right kind of total cost of ownership as well as value messaging. This is the tightest level of alignment I have seen between products, marketing and sales in terms of the key messages that we are delivering and our teams are very, very focused. And so I think from an internal standpoint, systems, automation, messaging alignment are all in favor of driving consistent execution there. Thank you so much for all the engaged questions as well as the support and look forward to connecting back again in a few months. Mike?"

Now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to HubSpot's Chief Executive Officer, Yamini Rangan. Yamini?\nYamini Rangan: Thank you Ryan and welcome everyone to the call. I'll start by discussing our Q3 2024 results and the key trends driving our momentum. Then I'll give an update on the product launches at Inbound and the feedback from our customers. I'll wrap by highlighting how we are setting ourselves apart as a leading customer platform for scaling companies. Let's dive in. Q3 was another strong quarter for HubSpot, with revenue growing 20% year-over-year in constant currency. We delivered another quarter of significant operating margin growth with over 200 basis points of margin expansion year-over-year, driving our operating margin to 19%. Total customers grew to 238,000 customers globally, driven by 10,000 net customer additions in the quarter. I am thrilled to see customers continuing to consolidate on HubSpot as their customer platform, driven by our focus on customers and our pace of product innovation. In the upmarket segment, we continue to see strong momentum in large deals and Multi Hub Wins trends that have remained consistent throughout this year. Two main factors are driving larger deals. First, our product market fit has improved significantly in upmarket and second, our platform's ease of use and ability to deliver quick results resonate with scaling companies. Discerning upmarket buyers want lower costs, high value and great adoption in a matter of weeks. We deliver on all of these, making HubSpot an easy choice for them. Multi Hub Wins are driven by customers looking to consolidate their tech stack, another level of innovation in our hubs like Content Hub and service hub. In Q3, more than 50% of our new business in Pro plus tiers came from customers using three or more hubs. Additionally, over 40% of our install base of customers now use all three core marketing, sales and service, highlighting the value our customers find in HubSpot's unified customer platform. It has been a great year for Content Hub with rapid growth driven by AI innovation. We added video capabilities to our popular Content Remix feature and launched Content Agent that helps create and personalize content. Customers are quickly adopting these AI features to create landing pages, videos and blog posts and they're seeing immediate value. For example, Franchise Brokers association, our customer, who connects great leaders with franchise opportunities, increase content production by 250% and improve organic lead generation by 216% using tools like our Blog Writer and Content Remix. The level of innovation with AI features in Content Hub has accelerated growth and the Attach rate to Marketing Hub is Strong at nearly 50%. In Service Hub, we introduced new features to better support larger customers, including a customer agent that helps answer customer questions, a new customer success workspace to help teams improve retention, and enhancements to the help desk. These innovations are driving higher attach and upgrade rates. Customers appreciate having tickets and conversations in one workspace, which is making them more productive. With the level of innovation and recent launches targeted at customers with larger service teams, we have seen customers with 100 plus service hub seats grow 60% year-over-year. Overall, I am thrilled with the progress we are making across product innovation and go to market execution to drive up market momentum. In the lower-end of our segment, we've continued to drive strong customer growth by improving our product and pricing. Our pricing strategy is working. We lowered the seat price to make it easy for customers to get started and we removed seat minimums to make it easy for customers to upgrade and grow. With HubSpot, we made significant progress in driving higher volumes of customers, which is now offsetting expected ASP decline. We've alsoimproved our free and starter tiers to increase conversion rates. We added personalized upgrade prompts throughout the customer journey to encourage more customers to move from free to starter and drive conversion rates. In addition, we relaunched the starter tier in July which is improved customer experience. All of these changes have helped us drive net customer growth in this segment. Now the highlight of Q3 was of course our Annual Inbound Conference where we launched a significant set of AI innovations that were very well received by our customers and partners. The event was a huge success, attracting over 12,000 in person attendees and over 40,000 online. The conference and the campaigns following have generated nearly one billion impressions, creating tremendous momentum as we closed out Q3. While Inbound showcased over 200 new innovations, the two standout moments were the launches of Breeze and Breeze Intelligence. Here's a quick recap of what we launched in the customer feedback sofar. At Inbound, we launched breeze, which is HubSpot's AI that powers the entire platform in including Copilot, agents, new features and an agent marketplace. Our strategy is to embed AI into every hub and across the entire platform and democratize AI for scaling companies. Since the launch, we have seen a notable increase in AI awareness, adoption and usage. AI awareness within HubSpot grew by 13% quarter over quarter, with two thirds of enterprise and half of pro customers engaging with AI features. Copilot, our AI assistant, has resonated well, particularly with startup customers who use it to summarize CRM data and objects, rewrite text and generate insights from their customer data. Copilot is now in public beta and we are seeing Repeat usage with 43% of users, which is a strong start. We alsolaunched four agents at Inbound: Social, Content, Prospecting and Customer. Though still in beta, customers are already seeing value, for example Kaplan early learning company is using our customer agent to enable 25% to 30% of their customers to self-serve, reducing average ticket response time by 30%. Morehouse College is using our content agent to create blogs with best practices which has resulted in 30% increase in page views and 27% more time spent on their site. Exactly the kind of results content marketers are looking to drive with AI today. And we know AI is only as good as the data that powers it, which is why we alsolaunched Breeze Intelligence to provide our customers with the best possible data about their customers. To recap, Breeze Intelligence does three things. It enriches company and contact data with over 200 million data points, provides buyer intent signals to prioritize prospects and when those prospects visit their website, shortens fonts to increase conversion all out of the box in HubSpot. While this is still in beta, it has been ungated now for all customers and there is clear enthusiasm. Customers are using it for lead scoring to see if the company is in their ideal customer profile. Lead routing to send leads to the right reps. Segmentation and personalization to ensure the right messaging gets to the right person. It's early days, but the trends from our September cohort are strong with high activation and repeat usage rates. And finally, let's talk about our recent acquisition of Cash Flow and how we are advancing our commerce vision. Everything we do at HubSpot is in service of one clear goal Solving for the customer. In 2023, we launched commerce Hub based on the belief that for businesses to grow, they not only need customer data but alsoneed transaction data. What they bought, when they paid, how long they have, until renewal; we've made progress by offering simple billing and payment with Commerce Hub processing more than one billion in GMV with strong year-over-year growth in enrollment. By acquiring Cash Flow, we're doubling down to provide subscription management and robust configuration pricing and quoting CPQ tools right in HubSpot. That means our customers will be able to close deals faster and increase revenue while having their customer and transaction data in one place. Sarika and Brian, the founders at Cashflow, have decades of experience in the space and have built a high performing team focused on removing the friction when a prospect decides to purchase. One of HubSpot's competitive advantages is having a crafted product and that is a promise we intend to keep with acquisitions. To wrap up, we doubled down on product innovation and we are leading with AI and data. We understand what it takes to help SMBs grow a platform that is easy, fast and unified. And that is exactly why our customers are consolidating on HubSpot as their platform of choice. With our relentless focus on innovation and solid momentum in Q3, I'm more confident than ever in HubSpot's durable growth. A huge thank you to all HubSpotters around the world for staying focused on our customers every single day. With that, I'll turn the call over to Kate to take you through Q3 results in more detail. Kate?\nKate Bueker: Thanks Yamini. Let's turn to our third quarter 2024 financial results. Q3 revenue grew 20% year-over-year in both constant currency and on an as reported basis. Subscription revenue grew 20% year-over-year while services and other revenue increased 28% on an as reported basis. Q3 domestic revenue grew 20% year-over-year. International revenue growth was 21% in constant currency and 20% as reported, now representing 47% of total revenue. We added over 10,000 net new customers in Q3, ending the quarter with a total of 238,000 customers growing 23% year-over-year. Average subscription revenue per customer was $11,200, down 2% year-over-year in both constant currency and on an as reported basis. We saw a healthy balance of low-end customer additions across starter and professional tiers this quarter driven by the seats pricing model change. As a result, we continue to see a headwind to ASR PC from more customers getting started at lower initial price points. More multi hub and larger deals are offsetting these lower ASPs and ASR PC growth excluding our starter tier is in the mid-single digits. We continue to see healthy customer dollar retention rates in the high 80s in Q3. Net revenue retention held flat sequentially driven by continued improvements in downgrades and early positive momentum in seed upgrades offset by continued headwinds across our other upgrade motions. Calculated billings were $681 million in Q3, growing 20% year-over-year in constant currency and 24% on an AS reported basis. The significant weakening of the US dollar at the end of the quarter and its impact on deferred revenue resulted in an overall 4-point FX tailwind to as reported billings growth. The remainder of my comments will refer to non-GAAP measures. Q3 operating margin was 19% up two points compared to the year ago period. This reflects our continued progress in driving efficiencies in our go-to-market and product infrastructure as well as a $7 million catch-up benefit related to R&D credits. Net income was $117 million in Q3 or $2.18 per fully diluted share. Free cash flow was $129 million in Q3 or 19% of revenue. Finally, our cash and marketable securities totalled $2.1 billion at the end of September. Before I dive into guidance, I wanted to touch quickly on the macro environment. We continue to operate in a value conscious buying environment consistent with what we've seen throughout 2024. Our Q4 guidance assumes this will persist through the end of the year. With that, let's review our guidance for the fourth quarter and full year of 2024. For the fourth quarter total as reported revenue is expected to be in the range of $672 million to $674 million, up 16% year-over-year. At the midpoint, we expect foreign exchange to be a one-point tailwind to as reported revenue growth in the quarter. Non-GAAP operating profit is expected to be between $128 million and $129 million. Non-GAAP diluted net income per share is expected to be between $2.18 and $2.20. This assumes 53.8 million fully diluted shares outstanding and for the full year of 2024 total as reported revenue is now expected to be in the range of $2.597 billion to $2.599 billion, up 20% year-over-year. We continue to expect foreign exchange to be roughly neutral to as reported revenue growth for the full year. Non-GAAP operating profit is now expected to be between $455 million and $456 million. Non-GAAP diluted net income per share is now expected to be between $7.98 and $8. This assumes $53.4 million fully diluted shares outstanding. As you adjust your models, please keep in mind the following we now expect CapEx as a percentage of revenue to be roughly 5% and free cash flow to be about $420 million for the full year of 2024. And finally, on November 1, we successfully closed our acquisition of Cashflow, a leading B2B subscription billing and CPQ company. We expect a de minimis impact to revenue in Q4 from the acquisition and a slight headwind to expenses like Yamini. I'm excited about the value cash flow we'll create for our Commerce Hub customers by making it easy for them to send quotes, close deals and get paid. With that operator, let's please open up the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] First question today is from Mark Murphy at JPMorgan.\nMark Murphy: Thank you so much and congratulations to all the HubSpotters on the phenomenal results. Kate, I wanted to ask you how might you describe the investment HubSpot is making into AI. Just do you have any model training expenses that are feathering into the R&D line? That seems like it's up-ticking as a percentage of revenue. And might you have some inference flowing through the cost of goods sold as you commercialize the models or just anything that would help us understand the amount of R&D going into your AI initiatives? And then for Yamini, are you seeing that daily usage or engagement pick up or develop faster with the Breeze products that are in beta right now?\nKate Bueker: Thanks, Mark, for the question. Maybe I'll start and then I'll hand it over to Yamini for the usage part of the question. AI is a top priority investment area for us, and you do see some impact although still modest on our cost of goods sold from the AI investments, I think you would if you looked back in time, recognize our philosophy for a long time has been to try to invest in an outsized way in our R&D organization sothat we can continue to drive the innovation flywheel that will fuel long-term growth for us. And sowe have continued to do that over the last few years. And one of the big areas of investment certainly is AI.\nYamini Rangan: Yes. And Mark, thank you again for that question. I will double down on what Kate said. Innovation and AI first innovation, in particular, our top priority for the company and will continue to be the top priority going forward. We are a platform company, and we will be the app and agent platform to help our customers innovate and grow. And our overall strategy to embed AI into every hub and across the entire platform is really working. I'm very pleased with the progress that we are making. I look at our AI strategy, and I'm looking at three indicators. The first is, if AI awareness within our customer base and prospect base increasing Second, are we beginning to see repeat usage. And third is that driving consistent value. And I'm pleased that we're making progress on all three. As I just shared, when we launched Breeze at inbound, we did it soit can be consistent. It can be easy. Our customers can recognize features and begin to adopt it. we saw AI awareness go up by 13% in just one quarter. And soI think the brief branding as well as how customers are getting aware of the features within the product is working. And if I look at our enterprise and Pro customers in particular, I'm really pleased with the repeat usage and that every day, every week, every couple of weeks, and we're beginning to see repeat usage trend in the right direction. And then in terms of overall value, I would continue to highlight that content use cases, service use cases and even sales guided selling use cases are beginning to add consistent value. So overall, really pleased with the AI momentum, really pleased with what we are seeing in terms of usage and value post inbound.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rishi Jaluria at RBC Capital Markets.\nRishi Jaluria: Wonderful. Thanks so much for taking my question and I should see a continued momentum in the business. Maybe I want to continue by talking about some of the investments in AI, clearly seeing some early traction with Breeze, and really exciting to see that. When we think about maybe some of your offerings around agent anagenic AI, many can you maybe help us consider how is the future of how customers interact with and work with HubSpot in both a copilot and a genetic AI world going to look like? And ultimately, if you can help those customers become meaningfully more successful and more productive at that, how do you think that maybe impacts your own pricing power or pricing model with those customers?\nYamini Rangan: Yes, multiple questions there. I'm going to get started and then Dharmesh, who lives brief agent can also share his thoughts. I'd say that living in an exciting world. There is just a transformative technology that's happening. CoPilots. We just launched a CoPilot, which helps any front office, marketeer, sales force and service person, n do better work. And agents work for them, right, whether it is in content our customers. So at INBOUND, we launched Bolt. CoPilot that we launched is seeing very good and very early traction with all of our customers because it's just easy, it just allows them to tap into HubSpot at a very broad level, use natural language to be able to ask questions, summarize CRM object summarize insights, and that's gaining traction. And we launched four agents content prospecting, customer and social and now they're all kind of moving into beta, and beginning to see really consistent results. So we think the future is all about CoPilots and agents driving value with structured and unstructured data within the customer platform. I'll say one quick thing about the pricing question that you asked. We will stay very, very consistent with our pricing philosophy. Add value before we think about monetizing value that has really worked for us throughout our history. We are very, very focused on driving that value, and we'll continue to do that. In terms of agents, when agents begin to deliver consistent value, we'll likely have different axes for agents, whether it is credit or tokens or something that is consumption based. But right now, we're really focused on delivering value. Dharmesh?\nDharmesh Shah: Yes. A couple of points to add to that would be. One is we're taking a very kind of as we do with all things, very platform-based approach to agents as well, which is we're building the underlying platform to allow our customers and partners to build these agent applications that leverage our unified data store. We have all the information on singular cohesive place. And what we found is that, that kind of data access makes lots of very interesting agent use case is possible. The thing that's happening now in terms of like in the moment is that the other part of our kind of agent approach is that we have an open model in terms of which large language models and which AI tool sets we use. And what this allows us to do is to say, as the industry is evolving, there is no one model to rule them all. We can move across models based on what the best tool is for a given use case, a differentiated from how others are approaching it. And just recently, we saw OpenAI launched the 01 model. which has much better reasoning as they break through in terms of large language models, and we're able to capitalize on those kinds of innovations that are happening in the kind of AI ecosystem as a result of this kind of open approach to large language models and the AI tools.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Samad Samana with Jefferies.\nSamad Samana: Hi, good evening. Thanks for taking my questions. I'll echo the congrats from peers. Kate, I want to talk about the smallest line item that you guys report, which is the professional services revenue. And I know it's small today, but you're seeing the gross product dollars there inflect, and I suspect it's because payments is a high-margin business. I'm curious how you're -- what's driving the inflection, if that's the case? And how do you see cash flow maybe strategically fitting into that? Could you maybe double-click on that and how we think about a revenue model for that company?\nKate Bueker: Yes. Thanks, Samad, for the question. Maybe I'll just start with a reminder that you're right in -- you're exactly right in how you asked the question, which is that services and other revenue line item is actually very small as a percentage of our overall revenue at 2%. The large part of that number continues to be services. And we primarily think about services as an enabler of our software business. As you know, we have been increasingly leaning in with partners to provide customer onboarding and ongoing customer services. And so the services portion of that revenue line item has been a headwind over the last couple of years. On the positive side, we have seen year-over-year growth that is largely being driven by the momentum we're seeing on the Commerce business, right? So we talked about the growth that we are seeing in monthly transacting customers and GMV at INBOUND. And that is what's driving that in the positive direction. Now in terms of margin, it is a combination of things. We have -- we have done a lot of work to drive efficiencies within our support and services organizations, and that is the primary needle mover for the margins of that line item.\nYamini Rangan: And then Samad, I think you also asked about our recent acquisition of Cash Flow. I'm really excited about this. because it accelerates the vision that we have for our customer platform, not just making it easy for sellers to sell, which is what our core platform does, but also making it easy for buyers to buy. And in order to do that, you've got to have both customer data and transaction data in one unified system, and that is exactly what we can do with Cash Flow. And as Kate just mentioned, we've had a year of pretty strong momentum with CommerceHub. You can see that because of the product innovation that we have driven, helping our customers bring their own payment processors and providing flexibility for invoicing and billing. But at the same time, when we have asked our customers what more can we be doing, they ask us for more sophisticated subscription management capabilities, more sophisticated CPQ functionality. I'd say like those two are the most frequently asked request from our customers in terms of where they want to see us go. And cash flow is doing exactly that. Now when we started talking to Sarika and Brian, who are the founders of cash flow, there are just have the same DNA as us. They've been thinking about this problem. They want to make it easy. In fact, half of the customers they currently have are HubSpot customers. So they normally understand the need of our customers, but they have been thinking about this problem for our customers. And so we're really excited to bring the whole team on board, and we're going to take the same approach like we take with all acquisitions. We'll keep it very true in terms of having a crafted product. will natively build new functionality, so we deliver a seamless experience and will accelerate our product vision.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI.\nKirk Materne: Yes, thanks very much and I'll add my congrats. I'll add my congrats. Kate, I was wondering, as you spoke about the NRR trends this quarter, you mentioned that there were some headwinds on other upgrade motions. Is there anything more you can add there? Is it specific hubs? Or is it just sort of the macro remaining? I realize it's really consistent with what you guys have talked about. But I was just curious if there's anything either hub specific or geographic that you could call out on that?\nKate Bueker: Yes. Thanks for the question, Kirk. I would say it's much the same as the last few quarters as it relates to net revenue retention. I think the positive aspects of net revenue retention remain a really strong foundation of customer dollar retention. We see that holding very well in the high 80s. Downgrades have been stable now or stabilized for a number of quarters. And so both of those things are positive. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we are also seeing some green shoots on the seat upgrades, largely as a result of the pricing model change. All the other upgrade motions continue to have pressure. That's addition upgrades, it's cross-sell, it's discount upgrades. It's really -- and contact, it's across the board there. So nothing specific to call out. You didn't ask the question, but I would expect that we will see largely the same in Q4.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research.\nAlex Zukin: Hey guys, I echo the congratulations on another very solid quarter. Maybe I'm going to try my best to ask a multipart question here. The impact that you're seeing from what I would characterize as kind of one of the most clear AI propositions that you talked about at inbound. Is that -- what is that doing to sales cycles? Is it making them -- is it driving more of them? Is it making them longer, but bigger? And how do we think about into the big selling quarter, Q4 last year, it was a big quarter for you guys, I would almost characterize it as a kind of a budget flush quarter. How do we think about that into this quarter? I realize not much kind of change in the macro at this point in time. But how are you thinking about that and anticipating that for Q4 and beyond?\nYamini Rangan: Alex, thanks for the question. I would say that if last year, AI was a buzzword and there was a level of hesitancy on how AI needs to get adopted. This year, our customers tell us that AI is real. There's real value. There's real use cases, there's real growth opportunities. And if anything that they took away from inbound, it was that they got to get going on it. And so following inbound into the conversations in late Q3 and Q4. There's just been a lot of momentum that has been driven through our Breeze and Breeze Intelligence launches. And specifically, the approach that we have taken is to embed AI into every hub. So if you're sitting here as a customer thinking about next year's growth, Well, you want a better content marketing platform. You want better guided selling solutions. You want better service capabilities that leverage AI. And so all of those conversations are happening now. Tangibly, it's doing two things. One, it is increasing the attach rate of Content Hub Service Hub to our core hubs. And you can see this consistently through the year as our customers have really embraced content use cases. Content Hub has seen pretty significant growth and a 50% attach rate to marketing hub, and it's similar in terms of the multi-hub momentum within Service Hub. So all of those are positive going into Q4. Q4 is a big quarter. December is a big month. And we have all of the pipeline. Now it really comes down to execution, and we are laser-focused on executing.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brad Sills with Bank of America.\nBradley Sills: I wanted to ask a question around the strength you're seeing in these multi-hub wins. It really seems like a standout this quarter. And you called out content and Service Hub, in particular, is seeing traction. I would love a little bit of color is that customers that are kind of landing with a multi-hub footprint? Are you seeing more of that kind of cross-sell activity that's occurring more recently? And why now, I guess, would be the question? Why -- what is it about the products or maybe it's the environment that you're starting to see even more momentum? I know it's been strong in the past, but it sounds like it's an area where you're seeing some real uptick\nYamini Rangan: That is a great question, and the answer is all of the above. And what I mean by that is we are seeing multi-hub both in terms of new customers that we are winning, and we are seeing multi-hub that is driven in the installed base as customers adopt one and go far more. And the most prevalent combinations are Marketing Hub, Sales Hub. We just land with Marketing Hub, Sales Hub and the second most prevalent multi-hub lands or Marketing Hub, Sales Hubg and Service Hub. And I think the consistent themes that we have seen here are driven by a couple of things. The first one is that our customers are consolidating. They're consolidating and they're looking at HubSpot as a platform that provides insights across their entire front office, right? That is exactly what is happening, and we've seen the spend continue throughout this year. The second is the level of innovation. And sometimes, it is not just about the strategy, it's about alignment to the strategy and executing the strategy. We've had a strategy of going from app to suite to platform. And as part of that strategy, we have really picked up the pace of innovation across not just the front end hubs like marketing and sales, but across every single hub and the level of innovation drives multi-hub. Content Hub, Service Hub, great examples of that. So the answer is the environment is more conducive for consolidation and the level of innovation that we are driving makes us that choice and is driving multi-hub momentum.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo Securities.\nMichael Turrin: Great. Some useful color on the net retention characteristics throughout the prepared remarks, just in helping us think through what could catalyze a return to that broader upgrade motion, kind of appreciate the environment currently. But just whenever that services, the team has been layering a lot of new innovation into the product portfolio. So just wondering if there are specific hubs new features, functionality, you're hearing customer interest around post inbound that could eventually, whenever we get to that point catalyze that return to upsell and appreciation for some of the advanced functionality you've been adding?\nKate Bueker: Yes. Maybe I'll take that one. And I guess what I would do, Michael, as we would call you back to some of the conversation that we had at the Analyst Day. There's some strong foundation that we see in net revenue retention. We talked -- and I've already talked about it on this call that customer dollar retention is really firm and strong in the high 80s. The higher multi-hub customer and the platform adoption that Yamini is talking about really just translates into higher usage of the product and stronger customer retention. So that's a nice tailwind for us. Downgrades continues to stabilize, as I said. And so that's also a nice tailwind. And then the change to or the move to the new seat-based pricing model should also be a tailwind as we transition the existing installed base and as more and more of our customer base gets started on the new seat-based pricing model. On the other hand, as you know, we continue to see some headwinds and pressure on the upgrade motion. We've been operating in what we would call a value conscious buying environment for a while. It is unpredictable out there if today is not another example. And so -- it's hard to say when that is going to change. But really, that is going to -- that is an ingredient required for us to really see net revenue retention expand from here.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Elizabeth Porter with Morgan Stanley.\nElizabeth Porter : I wanted to follow up on the upgrade rate from starters. I'm hoping if you could just double click on the comment around early reads from the new pricing model potentially benefiting that pace. Understanding it's probably a small part today, but just in the future, how should we just think about the opportunity given the high volume of Star customers that have really been added over the last few years?\nKate Bueker: Yes. Thanks, Elizabeth. The upgrade rate from starting into professional has really stayed relatively stable here for a pretty long period of time. The shift to the seat-based pricing model does two things. One, it lowers the barrier of entry to get started, not only on starter but also on professional. And so what you saw this quarter was a little bit more of a balance in our new customer adds or net customer adds across professional as well as starter. And then over time, we do believe that we will see an increase in the upgrade rate, but it's still early for us to give lots of concrete data points there.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tyler Radke with Citi.\nTyler Radke: Thank you for taking the question. This quarter, it seemed like you raised the full year revenue guidance by more than you'd be. We didn't see that the last two quarters. I guess, first, was there any FX considerations we should be taking into account there? And if not, maybe just unpack kind of the drivers of the increased confidence? Was it just better visibility in terms of this pricing rollout, more stable macro view? Anything you'd just add in terms of what's driving the stronger raise relative to what we've seen in the last two quarters?\nKate Bueker: Yes. Before I walk through the math, Tyler, just a comment on the assumptions around the environment moving into Q4. I tried to share in my prepared remarks a bit of color here, but our assumption is that it's going to be very much the same environment moving into Q4. We've been operating through a year in an environment where we've seen more decision-makers evolve in deals and higher bar action. We think that's going to continue, and that's embedded in the guidance that we shared with you. But if I walk you through the specific pieces here, we beat the midpoint of our Q3 guidance by $24 million, and we're flowing that through to the full year. We're also raising the full year guidance by an additional $3 million, and that's really just a reflection of incremental FX benefits that we expect to see in Q4. So on a constant currency basis, our outlook for Q4 is unchanged to our prior guidance with a growth of 15%. And we feel, as Yamini told you earlier in the call, we feel good about our pipeline, and we're just laser-focused on executing the big quarter in Q4.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Gabriela Borges with Goldman Sachs.\nGabriela Borges: Yamini, I want to ask you about the competitive dynamic in the mid-market at some of your large new customer adds? And what specifically, when you have competitors who perhaps respond with more aggressive pricing concessions when they see the success you're having. What approach or what framework do you give to your sales folks to help kind of navigate that conversation, given how much focus you put on the value of the HubSpot product suite and the engagement of the customers that you do run?\nYamini Rangan: Gabriela, good to hear from you. And it's a great question. I think you answered the question, which is we focus on value. I think the environment is competitive and it's always been competitive. And we don't compete on price. We compete on value. And so the playbooks, the conversations that we have with our customers all focus on the total cost of ownership. And there, we have a distinct advantage. You don't need a big consulting project with large size. You don't need 10 developers inside. You don't need a huge army of admins that are inside. And so we talk about that and there's like tangible total cost benefits there. And then we got to talk about value and very specifically in this environment and in any environment, our customers care about getting value quickly. It is fast time to value in a matter of weeks, not months, not years. And so we have tangible proof that we can drive the value in a matter of weeks. And when I talk to customers, I ask them a simple question. in the previous times that they have CRM, how many of their salespeople use CRM in a year. And if the answer is anything like 20%, 30%, which is what is typical, and we talk about how we can drive adoption because the ultimate value that they get is getting adoption to be in the high 80s and 90s, which we can consistently do. And so while the environment is competitive, we win on being easy to use. We win on being fast time to value, delivering fast time value and having a very unified crafted experience that helps our customers grow.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Joshua Reilly with Needham.\nJoshua Reilly: With the cash flow acquisition, that gets you kind of into this, what I would characterize, somewhat competitive space for SMB subscription billing and invoicing, but it seems that I think you're going to have an edge with your platform strategy there versus competitors that are primarily point solutions. How do you kind of leverage that edge to grow that within the broader hub for Commerce Hub.\nYamini Rangan: I love that question, and you're exactly right. It is a platform advantage, right? Almost everything comes down to our customers keep telling us it's not about individual products and point solutions. It's about having a unified platform with customer and transaction data, and cash flow allows us to do that. And if you look at what cash flow will enable us from creating an easy proposal, making changes to the proposal, getting the proposal signed, completing the payment and doing it in a super seamless way and getting all of that information in a seamless manner, so that the next set of customer conversations are armed with those insights. That is really our vision for commerce and it's going to help us enable that. And ultimately, we just want a single platform that's easy for sellers to sell and buyers to buy, and we're pretty excited about how we can accelerate that vision.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ken Wong with Oppenheimer.\nKen Wong: Great. Thanks for taking my question, Kate, I wanted to maybe dive into the customer adds. I think in the past, you guys touched on 9,000 to 10,000, you did 10,000 this year, but also talked up really strong conversions and [indiscernible] tailwinds as well as relaunching the kind of starter in July. How should we think about what that pacing could look like going forward?\nKate Bueker: Yes. Ken, thanks for that one. We were actually very happy with the 10,000 customer additions we delivered in Q3. It was right in line with the range that we shared on our last call of 9,000 to 10,000. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, there was a balanced mix in those customers adds across our professional and starter additions in the quarter. We've talked about the fact that, that was largely enabled by the new seats pricing model and the elimination of seat minimums. The other thing we talked about last quarter was that we were starting to lap some very large starter cohorts from the back half of 2023. And although those cohorts were renewing at a similar rate, the nominal number of customers that were leaving the platform were higher. And we continue to see that this quarter. That said, the growth starter additions were really strong in Q3 So all of that said, I believe that at least in the near term, we should continue to look at that 9,000 to 10,000 as the right range for net adds.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Parker Lane with Stifel.\nParker Lane: Yamini, when we look at the new AI solutions that especially agency have, I'd love to hear more about the partner enablement programs, the campaigns you have in place there, and just what your overall vision is for the role that those partners will play in developing business-specific agents going forward?\nYamini Rangan: Parker, I love that question. I think partners are very excited about the AI vision. And I think they have a huge role to play. I mean if you step back and look at our AI strategy, it is to embed it into every hub. It is embedded into every -- across our entire platform and to provide a platform for partners to be able to build agents on top as well. And obviously, the first set of agents are the ones that we are developing and bringing to market like the 4 that we launched at inbound. But the vision for us is to be able to allow partners to be able to build on top as well. The enablement from a partner perspective has been going strong. At inbound, we had executive briefing sessions on where AI is going, where our product road map is going, and that certainly got our partners excited. And now we have like incentivized them, motivated them and hopefully inspire them to offer a set of in our AI services and to be able to bring what we are offering to our customers. And so I feel really good in terms of the feedback from partners both inbound as well as how we are executing overall in our AI strategy.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brent Bracelin with Piper Sandler.\nBrent Bracelin: Kate, I wanted to kind of go back to the growth algorithm here. If I look at Street expectations for next year, pretty wide variance of 12.5% to 18% growth. I get you're kind of reiterating this 15% growth rate for Q4. But that only includes a partial comp with clear, but what's the right kind of normalized growth profile puts and takes as we should think about the right growth rate for next year.\nKate Bueker: Yes. Thanks for the question. Look, it's obviously really early for us to start talking about 2025. We're in the middle of our financial planning process internally. And as always, we will provide you with guidance for 2025 when we report our results in February. So I'm not going to talk specifically about 2025, but I can talk a little bit about that growth algorithm, which we spent some time on at the Analyst Day. And over time, this is sort of a longer-term look. But over time, we think that there are a number of levers that we have to drive growth. The first is that we're still early. We have very low market share in a really big market. And so our ability to continue to drive new customer acquisition over time is strong. The second is that we are the customer platform of choice for scaling companies. And we expect that the trend that we're seeing towards bigger deals, towards more multi-hub deals is just going to continue. The third thing is, and we've talked about this before, we are transitioning our customer base onto our new seat-based pricing model. That should be a multiyear tailwind to us and should help us drive higher net revenue retention over time. And finally, we continue to innovate aggressively. In particular, we spent a lot of time talking about AI innovation, data innovation, commerce innovation. And all of these things are elements that can fuel long-term growth over time. And so I'm confident in our ability to drive durable growth over a long period of time here. All that said, like we have to execute very well in Q4 and there is a lot of uncertainty still out there in the market, and we will come back with a more clear view of 2025 in February.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Peterson with Raymond James.\nBrian Peterson: I wanted to hit on your appetite for M&A. You've been more active there over the last year or so with a clear a bit of cash flow. How are you thinking about the balance organic versus inorganic investments? And are there some hub adjacencies that look particularly interesting to you?\nYamini Rangan: That's a great question. And I think our approach to M&A has remained consistent. We take a very Apple-eque approach to M&A. And the approach is to look for great technology, great talent that can accelerate our customer platform vision. And we want to do that in a way where we do not disrupt the great customer experience that we offer. And so we've gotten very comfortable with executing this type of an M&A playbook. We look for great talent that can accelerate innovation in very specific parts of our platform. You mentioned Clear [indiscernible] Cash Flow. These are all examples of that. We look for great culture ads that can come and build something incredible. We want to natively build everything into HubSpot, so that we offer a crafted platform -- and we want to ensure that it drives financial results in the mid- to long term. That is the playbook you have seen us execute the playbook with Pricing with Clearbit. And we intend to do the same thing with cash flow. And we'll continue doing these types of acquisitions as it accelerates our vision.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Nick Altmann with Scotiabank.\nNick Altmann: Awesome. Just a quick one, but I think you guys said there was 60% growth in 100-plus deals for Service Hub customers, which is pretty interesting. But can you maybe just unpack how much of that is driven by larger lands or cross-selling some of those larger customers versus perhaps a little bit of better seat expansion or stabilization in Service Hub .\nYamini Rangan: Yes, that's a great question. Look, I'm very excited about the innovation that's happening in Service Hub, and I think the product team and the gold market teams have made excellent progress over the last 18 months. It's not one thing. It's the fact that we have consistently innovated in Service Hub. Last year, there was a lot of Pro features that we launched within the market. And this year, there were -- I'd say two big unlocks. The first is leveraging AI within support our customer agent. I talked a little bit about the success that we are seeing with customer agents that is helping our customers do faster self-serve with better knowledge bases and then more importantly, also helps handle some portion of the ticket, typically between 20% to 40%, and that has been great. I think the second part is that as we talk to a lot of our customers and prospects, we heard from them the need for having both support as well as customer success in one place. And therefore, earlier this year, as part of the spotlight, we launched a workspace for both customer success and for support, so it can drive retention and improvement. And then there's a steady drumbeat of offering better SLA management, better routing, more granular permission management. All of these are the ones that upmarket customers have been asking us for in service hub. And look, I think if you step back, we did this with Sales Hub. We started with a set of features. We consistently had a drumbeat of improving the product till it got to be a front door, we're doing the same thing with Service Hub. And I really feel good about where we are going with Service Hub. And therefore, we see it both in terms of new lands as well as expansion within our customer base.\nOperator: We have time for one more question. This question comes from Adam Holets with BMO.\nKeith Bachman: It's Keith Bachman here. I wanted to ask a question also on growth. And I'll break it into a couple of different parts. One, you talked about customer growth was 23%. Is there any growth metric you can give us on what was seat growth or a minimum was secret faster or slower than the customer growth? And the second is, how should we think about that seat growth or customer versus customer growth as we sort of tune our models for '25? And part of that is what I'm thinking about is as we get into it, ASRPC is being impacted by growth of lower-end seats. And as you anniversary the pricing model changes, does that continue on that ASRPC will grow will have a negative growth rate? Or do you anniversary it and all the innovation can flow through so that we could think about ASRPC perhaps beginning to grow next year?\nKate Bueker: Yes. Keith, I know there's sort of a lot of moving pieces in the growth equation and the ASRPC equation. I would just take a step back and reflect a little bit on the seed pricing model change that we made. And we made the change to lower the barrier to entry for customers to get started and then to upgrade and grow with HubSpot. And one of the ways is that they purchase what they need upfront and then they grow over time. And the assumption was that we would see higher net revenue retention from those customers. And I think the highlight of the seeds model change so far has been that, that sort of assumption that we had has truly played out. And so we have seen in those early cohorts that the customers who joined on the Seats model have higher upgrade rates and are upgrading and adding seats and have a higher net revenue retention. By definition, that means that it's growing faster than our sort of overall growth but we have not shared the specific data point around that.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes the HubSpot Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. Thank you to everyone who was able to join us today. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "content": "Yes. A couple of points to add to that would be. One is we're taking a very kind of as we do with all things, very platform-based approach to agents as well, which is we're building the underlying platform to allow our customers and partners to build these agent applications that leverage our unified data store. We have all the information on singular cohesive place. And what we found is that, that kind of data access makes lots of very interesting agent use case is possible. The thing that's happening now in terms of like in the moment is that the other part of our kind of agent approach is that we have an open model in terms of which large language models and which AI tool sets we use. And what this allows us to do is to say, as the industry is evolving, there is no one model to rule them all. We can move across models based on what the best tool is for a given use case, a differentiated from how others are approaching it. And just recently, we saw OpenAI launched the 01 model. which has much better reasoning as they break through in terms of large language models, and we're able to capitalize on those kinds of innovations that are happening in the kind of AI ecosystem as a result of this kind of open approach to large language models and the AI tools."

            "name": "Kate Bueker",
            "content": "Thanks Yamini. Let's turn to our third quarter 2024 financial results. Q3 revenue grew 20% year-over-year in both constant currency and on an as reported basis. Subscription revenue grew 20% year-over-year while services and other revenue increased 28% on an as reported basis. Q3 domestic revenue grew 20% year-over-year. International revenue growth was 21% in constant currency and 20% as reported, now representing 47% of total revenue. We added over 10,000 net new customers in Q3, ending the quarter with a total of 238,000 customers growing 23% year-over-year. Average subscription revenue per customer was $11,200, down 2% year-over-year in both constant currency and on an as reported basis. We saw a healthy balance of low-end customer additions across starter and professional tiers this quarter driven by the seats pricing model change. As a result, we continue to see a headwind to ASR PC from more customers getting started at lower initial price points. More multi hub and larger deals are offsetting these lower ASPs and ASR PC growth excluding our starter tier is in the mid-single digits. We continue to see healthy customer dollar retention rates in the high 80s in Q3. Net revenue retention held flat sequentially driven by continued improvements in downgrades and early positive momentum in seed upgrades offset by continued headwinds across our other upgrade motions. Calculated billings were $681 million in Q3, growing 20% year-over-year in constant currency and 24% on an AS reported basis. The significant weakening of the US dollar at the end of the quarter and its impact on deferred revenue resulted in an overall 4-point FX tailwind to as reported billings growth. The remainder of my comments will refer to non-GAAP measures. Q3 operating margin was 19% up two points compared to the year ago period. This reflects our continued progress in driving efficiencies in our go-to-market and product infrastructure as well as a $7 million catch-up benefit related to R&D credits. Net income was $117 million in Q3 or $2.18 per fully diluted share. Free cash flow was $129 million in Q3 or 19% of revenue. Finally, our cash and marketable securities totalled $2.1 billion at the end of September. Before I dive into guidance, I wanted to touch quickly on the macro environment. We continue to operate in a value conscious buying environment consistent with what we've seen throughout 2024. Our Q4 guidance assumes this will persist through the end of the year. With that, let's review our guidance for the fourth quarter and full year of 2024. For the fourth quarter total as reported revenue is expected to be in the range of $672 million to $674 million, up 16% year-over-year. At the midpoint, we expect foreign exchange to be a one-point tailwind to as reported revenue growth in the quarter. Non-GAAP operating profit is expected to be between $128 million and $129 million. Non-GAAP diluted net income per share is expected to be between $2.18 and $2.20. This assumes 53.8 million fully diluted shares outstanding and for the full year of 2024 total as reported revenue is now expected to be in the range of $2.597 billion to $2.599 billion, up 20% year-over-year. We continue to expect foreign exchange to be roughly neutral to as reported revenue growth for the full year. Non-GAAP operating profit is now expected to be between $455 million and $456 million. Non-GAAP diluted net income per share is now expected to be between $7.98 and $8. This assumes $53.4 million fully diluted shares outstanding. As you adjust your models, please keep in mind the following we now expect CapEx as a percentage of revenue to be roughly 5% and free cash flow to be about $420 million for the full year of 2024. And finally, on November 1, we successfully closed our acquisition of Cashflow, a leading B2B subscription billing and CPQ company. We expect a de minimis impact to revenue in Q4 from the acquisition and a slight headwind to expenses like Yamini. I'm excited about the value cash flow we'll create for our Commerce Hub customers by making it easy for them to send quotes, close deals and get paid. With that operator, let's please open up the call for questions. Thanks, Mark, for the question. Maybe I'll start and then I'll hand it over to Yamini for the usage part of the question. AI is a top priority investment area for us, and you do see some impact although still modest on our cost of goods sold from the AI investments, I think you would if you looked back in time, recognize our philosophy for a long time has been to try to invest in an outsized way in our R&D organization sothat we can continue to drive the innovation flywheel that will fuel long-term growth for us. And sowe have continued to do that over the last few years. And one of the big areas of investment certainly is AI. Yes. Thanks, Samad, for the question. Maybe I'll just start with a reminder that you're right in -- you're exactly right in how you asked the question, which is that services and other revenue line item is actually very small as a percentage of our overall revenue at 2%. The large part of that number continues to be services. And we primarily think about services as an enabler of our software business. As you know, we have been increasingly leaning in with partners to provide customer onboarding and ongoing customer services. And so the services portion of that revenue line item has been a headwind over the last couple of years. On the positive side, we have seen year-over-year growth that is largely being driven by the momentum we're seeing on the Commerce business, right? So we talked about the growth that we are seeing in monthly transacting customers and GMV at INBOUND. And that is what's driving that in the positive direction. Now in terms of margin, it is a combination of things. We have -- we have done a lot of work to drive efficiencies within our support and services organizations, and that is the primary needle mover for the margins of that line item. Yes. Thanks for the question, Kirk. I would say it's much the same as the last few quarters as it relates to net revenue retention. I think the positive aspects of net revenue retention remain a really strong foundation of customer dollar retention. We see that holding very well in the high 80s. Downgrades have been stable now or stabilized for a number of quarters. And so both of those things are positive. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we are also seeing some green shoots on the seat upgrades, largely as a result of the pricing model change. All the other upgrade motions continue to have pressure. That's addition upgrades, it's cross-sell, it's discount upgrades. It's really -- and contact, it's across the board there. So nothing specific to call out. You didn't ask the question, but I would expect that we will see largely the same in Q4. Yes. Maybe I'll take that one. And I guess what I would do, Michael, as we would call you back to some of the conversation that we had at the Analyst Day. There's some strong foundation that we see in net revenue retention. We talked -- and I've already talked about it on this call that customer dollar retention is really firm and strong in the high 80s. The higher multi-hub customer and the platform adoption that Yamini is talking about really just translates into higher usage of the product and stronger customer retention. So that's a nice tailwind for us. Downgrades continues to stabilize, as I said. And so that's also a nice tailwind. And then the change to or the move to the new seat-based pricing model should also be a tailwind as we transition the existing installed base and as more and more of our customer base gets started on the new seat-based pricing model. On the other hand, as you know, we continue to see some headwinds and pressure on the upgrade motion. We've been operating in what we would call a value conscious buying environment for a while. It is unpredictable out there if today is not another example. And so -- it's hard to say when that is going to change. But really, that is going to -- that is an ingredient required for us to really see net revenue retention expand from here. Yes. Thanks, Elizabeth. The upgrade rate from starting into professional has really stayed relatively stable here for a pretty long period of time. The shift to the seat-based pricing model does two things. One, it lowers the barrier of entry to get started, not only on starter but also on professional. And so what you saw this quarter was a little bit more of a balance in our new customer adds or net customer adds across professional as well as starter. And then over time, we do believe that we will see an increase in the upgrade rate, but it's still early for us to give lots of concrete data points there. Yes. Before I walk through the math, Tyler, just a comment on the assumptions around the environment moving into Q4. I tried to share in my prepared remarks a bit of color here, but our assumption is that it's going to be very much the same environment moving into Q4. We've been operating through a year in an environment where we've seen more decision-makers evolve in deals and higher bar action. We think that's going to continue, and that's embedded in the guidance that we shared with you. But if I walk you through the specific pieces here, we beat the midpoint of our Q3 guidance by $24 million, and we're flowing that through to the full year. We're also raising the full year guidance by an additional $3 million, and that's really just a reflection of incremental FX benefits that we expect to see in Q4. So on a constant currency basis, our outlook for Q4 is unchanged to our prior guidance with a growth of 15%. And we feel, as Yamini told you earlier in the call, we feel good about our pipeline, and we're just laser-focused on executing the big quarter in Q4. Yes. Ken, thanks for that one. We were actually very happy with the 10,000 customer additions we delivered in Q3. It was right in line with the range that we shared on our last call of 9,000 to 10,000. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, there was a balanced mix in those customers adds across our professional and starter additions in the quarter. We've talked about the fact that, that was largely enabled by the new seats pricing model and the elimination of seat minimums. The other thing we talked about last quarter was that we were starting to lap some very large starter cohorts from the back half of 2023. And although those cohorts were renewing at a similar rate, the nominal number of customers that were leaving the platform were higher. And we continue to see that this quarter. That said, the growth starter additions were really strong in Q3 So all of that said, I believe that at least in the near term, we should continue to look at that 9,000 to 10,000 as the right range for net adds. Yes. Thanks for the question. Look, it's obviously really early for us to start talking about 2025. We're in the middle of our financial planning process internally. And as always, we will provide you with guidance for 2025 when we report our results in February. So I'm not going to talk specifically about 2025, but I can talk a little bit about that growth algorithm, which we spent some time on at the Analyst Day. And over time, this is sort of a longer-term look. But over time, we think that there are a number of levers that we have to drive growth. The first is that we're still early. We have very low market share in a really big market. And so our ability to continue to drive new customer acquisition over time is strong. The second is that we are the customer platform of choice for scaling companies. And we expect that the trend that we're seeing towards bigger deals, towards more multi-hub deals is just going to continue. The third thing is, and we've talked about this before, we are transitioning our customer base onto our new seat-based pricing model. That should be a multiyear tailwind to us and should help us drive higher net revenue retention over time. And finally, we continue to innovate aggressively. In particular, we spent a lot of time talking about AI innovation, data innovation, commerce innovation. And all of these things are elements that can fuel long-term growth over time. And so I'm confident in our ability to drive durable growth over a long period of time here. All that said, like we have to execute very well in Q4 and there is a lot of uncertainty still out there in the market, and we will come back with a more clear view of 2025 in February. Yes. Keith, I know there's sort of a lot of moving pieces in the growth equation and the ASRPC equation. I would just take a step back and reflect a little bit on the seed pricing model change that we made. And we made the change to lower the barrier to entry for customers to get started and then to upgrade and grow with HubSpot. And one of the ways is that they purchase what they need upfront and then they grow over time. And the assumption was that we would see higher net revenue retention from those customers. And I think the highlight of the seeds model change so far has been that, that sort of assumption that we had has truly played out. And so we have seen in those early cohorts that the customers who joined on the Seats model have higher upgrade rates and are upgrading and adding seats and have a higher net revenue retention. By definition, that means that it's growing faster than our sort of overall growth but we have not shared the specific data point around that."

            "name": "Yamini Rangan",
            "content": "Thank you Ryan and welcome everyone to the call. I'll start by discussing our Q3 2024 results and the key trends driving our momentum. Then I'll give an update on the product launches at Inbound and the feedback from our customers. I'll wrap by highlighting how we are setting ourselves apart as a leading customer platform for scaling companies. Let's dive in. Q3 was another strong quarter for HubSpot, with revenue growing 20% year-over-year in constant currency. We delivered another quarter of significant operating margin growth with over 200 basis points of margin expansion year-over-year, driving our operating margin to 19%. Total customers grew to 238,000 customers globally, driven by 10,000 net customer additions in the quarter. I am thrilled to see customers continuing to consolidate on HubSpot as their customer platform, driven by our focus on customers and our pace of product innovation. In the upmarket segment, we continue to see strong momentum in large deals and Multi Hub Wins trends that have remained consistent throughout this year. Two main factors are driving larger deals. First, our product market fit has improved significantly in upmarket and second, our platform's ease of use and ability to deliver quick results resonate with scaling companies. Discerning upmarket buyers want lower costs, high value and great adoption in a matter of weeks. We deliver on all of these, making HubSpot an easy choice for them. Multi Hub Wins are driven by customers looking to consolidate their tech stack, another level of innovation in our hubs like Content Hub and service hub. In Q3, more than 50% of our new business in Pro plus tiers came from customers using three or more hubs. Additionally, over 40% of our install base of customers now use all three core marketing, sales and service, highlighting the value our customers find in HubSpot's unified customer platform. It has been a great year for Content Hub with rapid growth driven by AI innovation. We added video capabilities to our popular Content Remix feature and launched Content Agent that helps create and personalize content. Customers are quickly adopting these AI features to create landing pages, videos and blog posts and they're seeing immediate value. For example, Franchise Brokers association, our customer, who connects great leaders with franchise opportunities, increase content production by 250% and improve organic lead generation by 216% using tools like our Blog Writer and Content Remix. The level of innovation with AI features in Content Hub has accelerated growth and the Attach rate to Marketing Hub is Strong at nearly 50%. In Service Hub, we introduced new features to better support larger customers, including a customer agent that helps answer customer questions, a new customer success workspace to help teams improve retention, and enhancements to the help desk. These innovations are driving higher attach and upgrade rates. Customers appreciate having tickets and conversations in one workspace, which is making them more productive. With the level of innovation and recent launches targeted at customers with larger service teams, we have seen customers with 100 plus service hub seats grow 60% year-over-year. Overall, I am thrilled with the progress we are making across product innovation and go to market execution to drive up market momentum. In the lower-end of our segment, we've continued to drive strong customer growth by improving our product and pricing. Our pricing strategy is working. We lowered the seat price to make it easy for customers to get started and we removed seat minimums to make it easy for customers to upgrade and grow. With HubSpot, we made significant progress in driving higher volumes of customers, which is now offsetting expected ASP decline. We've alsoimproved our free and starter tiers to increase conversion rates. We added personalized upgrade prompts throughout the customer journey to encourage more customers to move from free to starter and drive conversion rates. In addition, we relaunched the starter tier in July which is improved customer experience. All of these changes have helped us drive net customer growth in this segment. Now the highlight of Q3 was of course our Annual Inbound Conference where we launched a significant set of AI innovations that were very well received by our customers and partners. The event was a huge success, attracting over 12,000 in person attendees and over 40,000 online. The conference and the campaigns following have generated nearly one billion impressions, creating tremendous momentum as we closed out Q3. While Inbound showcased over 200 new innovations, the two standout moments were the launches of Breeze and Breeze Intelligence. Here's a quick recap of what we launched in the customer feedback sofar. At Inbound, we launched breeze, which is HubSpot's AI that powers the entire platform in including Copilot, agents, new features and an agent marketplace. Our strategy is to embed AI into every hub and across the entire platform and democratize AI for scaling companies. Since the launch, we have seen a notable increase in AI awareness, adoption and usage. AI awareness within HubSpot grew by 13% quarter over quarter, with two thirds of enterprise and half of pro customers engaging with AI features. Copilot, our AI assistant, has resonated well, particularly with startup customers who use it to summarize CRM data and objects, rewrite text and generate insights from their customer data. Copilot is now in public beta and we are seeing Repeat usage with 43% of users, which is a strong start. We alsolaunched four agents at Inbound: Social, Content, Prospecting and Customer. Though still in beta, customers are already seeing value, for example Kaplan early learning company is using our customer agent to enable 25% to 30% of their customers to self-serve, reducing average ticket response time by 30%. Morehouse College is using our content agent to create blogs with best practices which has resulted in 30% increase in page views and 27% more time spent on their site. Exactly the kind of results content marketers are looking to drive with AI today. And we know AI is only as good as the data that powers it, which is why we alsolaunched Breeze Intelligence to provide our customers with the best possible data about their customers. To recap, Breeze Intelligence does three things. It enriches company and contact data with over 200 million data points, provides buyer intent signals to prioritize prospects and when those prospects visit their website, shortens fonts to increase conversion all out of the box in HubSpot. While this is still in beta, it has been ungated now for all customers and there is clear enthusiasm. Customers are using it for lead scoring to see if the company is in their ideal customer profile. Lead routing to send leads to the right reps. Segmentation and personalization to ensure the right messaging gets to the right person. It's early days, but the trends from our September cohort are strong with high activation and repeat usage rates. And finally, let's talk about our recent acquisition of Cash Flow and how we are advancing our commerce vision. Everything we do at HubSpot is in service of one clear goal Solving for the customer. In 2023, we launched commerce Hub based on the belief that for businesses to grow, they not only need customer data but alsoneed transaction data. What they bought, when they paid, how long they have, until renewal; we've made progress by offering simple billing and payment with Commerce Hub processing more than one billion in GMV with strong year-over-year growth in enrollment. By acquiring Cash Flow, we're doubling down to provide subscription management and robust configuration pricing and quoting CPQ tools right in HubSpot. That means our customers will be able to close deals faster and increase revenue while having their customer and transaction data in one place. Sarika and Brian, the founders at Cashflow, have decades of experience in the space and have built a high performing team focused on removing the friction when a prospect decides to purchase. One of HubSpot's competitive advantages is having a crafted product and that is a promise we intend to keep with acquisitions. To wrap up, we doubled down on product innovation and we are leading with AI and data. We understand what it takes to help SMBs grow a platform that is easy, fast and unified. And that is exactly why our customers are consolidating on HubSpot as their platform of choice. With our relentless focus on innovation and solid momentum in Q3, I'm more confident than ever in HubSpot's durable growth. A huge thank you to all HubSpotters around the world for staying focused on our customers every single day. With that, I'll turn the call over to Kate to take you through Q3 results in more detail. Kate? Yes. And Mark, thank you again for that question. I will double down on what Kate said. Innovation and AI first innovation, in particular, our top priority for the company and will continue to be the top priority going forward. We are a platform company, and we will be the app and agent platform to help our customers innovate and grow. And our overall strategy to embed AI into every hub and across the entire platform is really working. I'm very pleased with the progress that we are making. I look at our AI strategy, and I'm looking at three indicators. The first is, if AI awareness within our customer base and prospect base increasing Second, are we beginning to see repeat usage. And third is that driving consistent value. And I'm pleased that we're making progress on all three. As I just shared, when we launched Breeze at inbound, we did it soit can be consistent. It can be easy. Our customers can recognize features and begin to adopt it. we saw AI awareness go up by 13% in just one quarter. And soI think the brief branding as well as how customers are getting aware of the features within the product is working. And if I look at our enterprise and Pro customers in particular, I'm really pleased with the repeat usage and that every day, every week, every couple of weeks, and we're beginning to see repeat usage trend in the right direction. And then in terms of overall value, I would continue to highlight that content use cases, service use cases and even sales guided selling use cases are beginning to add consistent value. So overall, really pleased with the AI momentum, really pleased with what we are seeing in terms of usage and value post inbound. Yes, multiple questions there. I'm going to get started and then Dharmesh, who lives brief agent can also share his thoughts. I'd say that living in an exciting world. There is just a transformative technology that's happening. CoPilots. We just launched a CoPilot, which helps any front office, marketeer, sales force and service person, n do better work. And agents work for them, right, whether it is in content our customers. So at INBOUND, we launched Bolt. CoPilot that we launched is seeing very good and very early traction with all of our customers because it's just easy, it just allows them to tap into HubSpot at a very broad level, use natural language to be able to ask questions, summarize CRM object summarize insights, and that's gaining traction. And we launched four agents content prospecting, customer and social and now they're all kind of moving into beta, and beginning to see really consistent results. So we think the future is all about CoPilots and agents driving value with structured and unstructured data within the customer platform. I'll say one quick thing about the pricing question that you asked. We will stay very, very consistent with our pricing philosophy. Add value before we think about monetizing value that has really worked for us throughout our history. We are very, very focused on driving that value, and we'll continue to do that. In terms of agents, when agents begin to deliver consistent value, we'll likely have different axes for agents, whether it is credit or tokens or something that is consumption based. But right now, we're really focused on delivering value. Dharmesh? And then Samad, I think you also asked about our recent acquisition of Cash Flow. I'm really excited about this. because it accelerates the vision that we have for our customer platform, not just making it easy for sellers to sell, which is what our core platform does, but also making it easy for buyers to buy. And in order to do that, you've got to have both customer data and transaction data in one unified system, and that is exactly what we can do with Cash Flow. And as Kate just mentioned, we've had a year of pretty strong momentum with CommerceHub. You can see that because of the product innovation that we have driven, helping our customers bring their own payment processors and providing flexibility for invoicing and billing. But at the same time, when we have asked our customers what more can we be doing, they ask us for more sophisticated subscription management capabilities, more sophisticated CPQ functionality. I'd say like those two are the most frequently asked request from our customers in terms of where they want to see us go. And cash flow is doing exactly that. Now when we started talking to Sarika and Brian, who are the founders of cash flow, there are just have the same DNA as us. They've been thinking about this problem. They want to make it easy. In fact, half of the customers they currently have are HubSpot customers. So they normally understand the need of our customers, but they have been thinking about this problem for our customers. And so we're really excited to bring the whole team on board, and we're going to take the same approach like we take with all acquisitions. We'll keep it very true in terms of having a crafted product. will natively build new functionality, so we deliver a seamless experience and will accelerate our product vision. Alex, thanks for the question. I would say that if last year, AI was a buzzword and there was a level of hesitancy on how AI needs to get adopted. This year, our customers tell us that AI is real. There's real value. There's real use cases, there's real growth opportunities. And if anything that they took away from inbound, it was that they got to get going on it. And so following inbound into the conversations in late Q3 and Q4. There's just been a lot of momentum that has been driven through our Breeze and Breeze Intelligence launches. And specifically, the approach that we have taken is to embed AI into every hub. So if you're sitting here as a customer thinking about next year's growth, Well, you want a better content marketing platform. You want better guided selling solutions. You want better service capabilities that leverage AI. And so all of those conversations are happening now. Tangibly, it's doing two things. One, it is increasing the attach rate of Content Hub Service Hub to our core hubs. And you can see this consistently through the year as our customers have really embraced content use cases. Content Hub has seen pretty significant growth and a 50% attach rate to marketing hub, and it's similar in terms of the multi-hub momentum within Service Hub. So all of those are positive going into Q4. Q4 is a big quarter. December is a big month. And we have all of the pipeline. Now it really comes down to execution, and we are laser-focused on executing. That is a great question, and the answer is all of the above. And what I mean by that is we are seeing multi-hub both in terms of new customers that we are winning, and we are seeing multi-hub that is driven in the installed base as customers adopt one and go far more. And the most prevalent combinations are Marketing Hub, Sales Hub. We just land with Marketing Hub, Sales Hub and the second most prevalent multi-hub lands or Marketing Hub, Sales Hubg and Service Hub. And I think the consistent themes that we have seen here are driven by a couple of things. The first one is that our customers are consolidating. They're consolidating and they're looking at HubSpot as a platform that provides insights across their entire front office, right? That is exactly what is happening, and we've seen the spend continue throughout this year. The second is the level of innovation. And sometimes, it is not just about the strategy, it's about alignment to the strategy and executing the strategy. We've had a strategy of going from app to suite to platform. And as part of that strategy, we have really picked up the pace of innovation across not just the front end hubs like marketing and sales, but across every single hub and the level of innovation drives multi-hub. Content Hub, Service Hub, great examples of that. So the answer is the environment is more conducive for consolidation and the level of innovation that we are driving makes us that choice and is driving multi-hub momentum. Gabriela, good to hear from you. And it's a great question. I think you answered the question, which is we focus on value. I think the environment is competitive and it's always been competitive. And we don't compete on price. We compete on value. And so the playbooks, the conversations that we have with our customers all focus on the total cost of ownership. And there, we have a distinct advantage. You don't need a big consulting project with large size. You don't need 10 developers inside. You don't need a huge army of admins that are inside. And so we talk about that and there's like tangible total cost benefits there. And then we got to talk about value and very specifically in this environment and in any environment, our customers care about getting value quickly. It is fast time to value in a matter of weeks, not months, not years. And so we have tangible proof that we can drive the value in a matter of weeks. And when I talk to customers, I ask them a simple question. in the previous times that they have CRM, how many of their salespeople use CRM in a year. And if the answer is anything like 20%, 30%, which is what is typical, and we talk about how we can drive adoption because the ultimate value that they get is getting adoption to be in the high 80s and 90s, which we can consistently do. And so while the environment is competitive, we win on being easy to use. We win on being fast time to value, delivering fast time value and having a very unified crafted experience that helps our customers grow. I love that question, and you're exactly right. It is a platform advantage, right? Almost everything comes down to our customers keep telling us it's not about individual products and point solutions. It's about having a unified platform with customer and transaction data, and cash flow allows us to do that. And if you look at what cash flow will enable us from creating an easy proposal, making changes to the proposal, getting the proposal signed, completing the payment and doing it in a super seamless way and getting all of that information in a seamless manner, so that the next set of customer conversations are armed with those insights. That is really our vision for commerce and it's going to help us enable that. And ultimately, we just want a single platform that's easy for sellers to sell and buyers to buy, and we're pretty excited about how we can accelerate that vision. Parker, I love that question. I think partners are very excited about the AI vision. And I think they have a huge role to play. I mean if you step back and look at our AI strategy, it is to embed it into every hub. It is embedded into every -- across our entire platform and to provide a platform for partners to be able to build agents on top as well. And obviously, the first set of agents are the ones that we are developing and bringing to market like the 4 that we launched at inbound. But the vision for us is to be able to allow partners to be able to build on top as well. The enablement from a partner perspective has been going strong. At inbound, we had executive briefing sessions on where AI is going, where our product road map is going, and that certainly got our partners excited. And now we have like incentivized them, motivated them and hopefully inspire them to offer a set of in our AI services and to be able to bring what we are offering to our customers. And so I feel really good in terms of the feedback from partners both inbound as well as how we are executing overall in our AI strategy. That's a great question. And I think our approach to M&A has remained consistent. We take a very Apple-eque approach to M&A. And the approach is to look for great technology, great talent that can accelerate our customer platform vision. And we want to do that in a way where we do not disrupt the great customer experience that we offer. And so we've gotten very comfortable with executing this type of an M&A playbook. We look for great talent that can accelerate innovation in very specific parts of our platform. You mentioned Clear [indiscernible] Cash Flow. These are all examples of that. We look for great culture ads that can come and build something incredible. We want to natively build everything into HubSpot, so that we offer a crafted platform -- and we want to ensure that it drives financial results in the mid- to long term. That is the playbook you have seen us execute the playbook with Pricing with Clearbit. And we intend to do the same thing with cash flow. And we'll continue doing these types of acquisitions as it accelerates our vision. Yes, that's a great question. Look, I'm very excited about the innovation that's happening in Service Hub, and I think the product team and the gold market teams have made excellent progress over the last 18 months. It's not one thing. It's the fact that we have consistently innovated in Service Hub. Last year, there was a lot of Pro features that we launched within the market. And this year, there were -- I'd say two big unlocks. The first is leveraging AI within support our customer agent. I talked a little bit about the success that we are seeing with customer agents that is helping our customers do faster self-serve with better knowledge bases and then more importantly, also helps handle some portion of the ticket, typically between 20% to 40%, and that has been great. I think the second part is that as we talk to a lot of our customers and prospects, we heard from them the need for having both support as well as customer success in one place. And therefore, earlier this year, as part of the spotlight, we launched a workspace for both customer success and for support, so it can drive retention and improvement. And then there's a steady drumbeat of offering better SLA management, better routing, more granular permission management. All of these are the ones that upmarket customers have been asking us for in service hub. And look, I think if you step back, we did this with Sales Hub. We started with a set of features. We consistently had a drumbeat of improving the product till it got to be a front door, we're doing the same thing with Service Hub. And I really feel good about where we are going with Service Hub. And therefore, we see it both in terms of new lands as well as expansion within our customer base."

Now, it\u2019s my pleasure to turn the call over to HubSpot\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, Yamini Rangan. Yamini?\nYamini Rangan: Thank you, Ryan, and welcome to everyone on the call. Today, I'll share our Q2 2024 results, discuss trends driving our momentum, and highlight early wins from our Spring Spotlight product launches. I'll also reiterate our strategy and playbook for winning both in the short and long-term. Let's dive in. Q2 was a solid quarter for HubSpot with revenue growing 21% year-over-year in constant currency. We delivered another quarter of operating margin growth with 270 basis points of margin expansion year-over-year, driving our operating margin to 17%. I'm really happy with the operating leverage we are continuing to deliver, while driving growth. Total customers grew to 228,000 customers globally, driven by over 11,200 net customer additions in the quarter. I'm thrilled to see customers consolidating on HubSpot, the consistent focus on innovation and execution demonstrated by our teams, and momentum we have in becoming the customer platform of choice for scaling companies. Our started year continues to fuel volume on the low end of the market, driven by product and pricing improvements. We have removed friction and have made it easy for customers to get started with HubSpot. We've streamlined the checkout process, so customers can now make clearer decisions about the functionality and seats they need. But most importantly, we're delivering compelling value for business owners focused on driving growth and meeting better visibility on customer trends in this environment. As a result, we're seeing strength in free sign-ups and starter ads. In up markets, our Q2 results were driven by multi-hub and large deal momentum. We saw more customers start with or expand into multiple hubs, resulting in larger deals. Over 45% of new business in our polls tiers came from customers using three or more hubs. Within customers adopting multiple hubs, we saw three popular combinations. Marketing and sales hubs our main front doors, marketing sales and Service Hubs, innovation in Service Hub is driving momentum and marketing sales from Content Hub after content Hub launch in April. The higher mix of multi-hub deals and the momentum we have with upmarket customers led to larger wins in Q2. Upmarket customers want to simplify and consolidate their tech stack and our focused investments to serve their needs and our pace of innovation make off their top choice. Okay. Let's talk about our pricing model changes that we introduced in early March and how it's progressing. As a reminder, we lowered the price point to get started with HubSpot removed seat minimums to reduce friction to upgrade and created a core seat for customers who want to edit CRM records. We did this to make HubSpot easy to buy and easy to grow with. When we made these changes, we expected it to lead to lower initial ASP, higher volume of customers and more upgrades and expansion over time. In Q2, we continue to make progress on driving higher volume to offset the ASP declines and expect this to happen in the next few months as we focus on enablement. We continue to see solid expansion trends with a multipoint increase in net revenue retention rate at month three for customers on the new pricing model as they buy exactly what they and expand when they need more. Overall, we continue to have high conviction that the pricing change is the right decision for our customers and therefore, for HubSpot. To round out Q2, let's talk about the innovation we drove with our Spring Spotlight product launches and how they're driving momentum. In April, as part of our first Spring Spotlight, we introduced major updates to Service Hub and launched Content Hub. The Service Hub update was a big unlock. It now supports both customer support and customer success teams on a single unified platform. We saw the number of wins with 100-plus service seats grew 55% year-over-year and 30% year-to-date. In addition, we saw a 200% increase in portals closing ticket in help desk since the relaunch. In terms of Content Hub, our goal is to provide an AI-powered content marketing solution that can help marketeers create and manage content. And the response has been fantastic. The attach rate for Content Hub to Marketing Hub has tripled since the launch and is now nearly 50% for new marketing hub wins. This high attach rate is being driven by innovative AI features like content remix, AI blogs and brand voice. Brands like Tripadvisor, World Widelife Fund for Nature and Morehouse College, are all using HubSpot content solutions to grow. Overall, we're thrilled to see our product innovation drive value for our customers. Okay. On to the macro environment. We're seeing the same trends as last year and Q1, slower decision-making, more decision-makers involved and scrutiny on business case and value before spending. When decisions are made by committees, that often includes CEOs, CFOs, CROs, and many times require Board or BCP firm approval. The bar for buying continues to be high. We also see companies consolidating on fewer platforms that can help them grow. We're executing on our clear and proven playbook to drive growth in this environment. Let me step back and connect the dots on our playbook, where we are seeing momentum this year and how this sets us up for both short and long-term success. Our playbook for executing in any macro is clear. We solve our customers, help them grow by providing an AI-powered customer platform and drive the pace innovation that can make it easy for customers to stay ahead. HubSpot Excel when we know exactly who we are serving, and we have never been more clear. We are determined to delight growth professionals in marketing sales and service at scaling companies and to help them grow. This focus on solving for our customers and deep listening have resulted in clear momentum in customer acquisition. More importantly, it has led to strong retention with customer dollar retention consistently in the high 80s. As a company, we're doubling down our focus on our customers and are energized about helping them grow. The way we help them grow is by providing an AI-powered customer platform, which includes best-in-class engagement hubs, Smart CRM, which unifies customer data and teams and a connected ecosystem with app and solution partners. This platform strategy is working as more customers consolidate on HubSpot to lower cost and drive growth. In June, we crossed over one million active app integrations installed by Pro plus customers with more than 35% of them using 10 or more active app integration. Customers are bringing more data together within HubSpot and driving more insights from that data. In addition, we made a choice to embed AI in all of our hubs and within our Smart CRM, and this strategy is beginning to work. The early traction with Content Hub and the step change attach rate of Content Hub to Marketing Hub is just one example of the strategy working. According to our customer Sandler, HubSpot AI has been a game changer for our marketing and sales teams, helping both groups create personalization at scale with messaging, actionable insights and increasing new prospect engagement with our brand by 25%. Customers have an appetite to drive more growth powered by AI, and that's where we are focusing our efforts. In addition, we expanded support for sensitive data, which moved into beta in Q2. HubSpot's sensitive data solution makes it easy for customers to protect sensitive personal information to support their compliance with regulations like GDPR. This expands our opportunity to serve more customers in industries like health care, financial services and insurance, and makes it easy for customers to manage complex compliance processes. Early adoption looks promising, existing enterprise customers are using new features to manage sensitive data, and they're seeing higher conversion rates and average selling prices with new customers. Our pace of innovation and focused execution have been crucial to our success now and will help us grow in the long-term. Reflecting on our results and progress, our strategy is working. I hope that it is abundantly clear we run our business for the long-term and are focused on solving for our customers, innovating our platform and prioritizing strong execution. This has been and will continue to be our priority. And that is what will continue to set us apart to drive durable growth and create long-term shareholder value. With that, I'll turn the call over to Kate to take you through our Q2 financial results. Kate?\nKate Bueker: Thanks, Yamini. Let's turn to our second quarter 2024 financial results. Q2 revenue grew 21% year-over-year in constant currency and 20% on an as-reported basis. Subscription revenue grew 20% year-over-year, while services and other revenue increased 18% on an as-reported basis. Q2 domestic revenue grew 20% year-over-year. International revenue growth was 22% in constant currency and 21% as reported, now representing 47% of total revenue. We added over 11,200 net customers in Q2 ending the quarter with a total customer count of $228,000, growing 23% year-over-year. Again, this quarter, the strength in customer additions was driven by momentum at the low end. Average subscription revenue per customer was $11,200, down 2% year-over-year in both constant currency and on an as-reported basis. ASRPC continues to be driven by several offsetting factors, a positive impact from an increasing number of professional and enterprise customers adopting multiple hubs, offset by the headwind from the continued strong volume of lower ASP starter customers we've acquired over the last year. Gross retention held nicely in the high 80s and net revenue retention was stable at 102%. While we continue to see strong customer dollar retention and downgrade trends, customer upgrade rates remain challenged, similar to Q1. We expect this behavior to continue in the back half of the year with net revenue retention holding around current levels. Calculated billings were $648 million in Q2, growing 20% year-over-year in both constant currency and on an as-reported basis. The remainder of my comments we'll refer to non-GAAP measures. Q2 operating margin was 17%, up 3 points compared to the year ago period, driven by the continued impact of our go-to-market efficiency and infrastructure optimization efforts. Net income was $104 million in Q2 or $1.94 per fully diluted share. Free cash flow was $92 million in Q2 or 14% of revenue. Finally, our cash and marketable securities totaled $1.9 billion at the end of June. With that, let's review our guidance for the third quarter and full year of 2024. As Yamini shared, we continue to operate in a challenging and volatile external environment. And our guidance assumes that the difficult demand environment persists through the back half of the year, but does not get materially worse. For the third quarter, total as reported revenue is expected to be in the range of $646 million to $647 million, up 16% year-over-year at the midpoint. We expect foreign exchange to be a slight headwind to as reported revenue growth in the quarter. Non-GAAP operating profit is expected to be between $107 million and $108 million. Non-GAAP diluted net income per share $1.89 and $1.91. This assumes 53.5 million fully diluted shares outstanding. And for the full year of 2024, total as-reported revenue is now expected to be in the range of $2.567 billion to $2.57 billion, up 18% year-over-year at the midpoint. We now expect foreign exchange to have a neutral impact to as-reported revenue growth for the full year. Non-GAAP operating profit is now expected to be between $437 million and $441 million. Non-GAAP diluted net income per share is now expected to be to be between $7.64 and $7.70. This assumes 53.4 million fully diluted shares outstanding. As you adjust your models, please keep in mind the following; we now expect CapEx as a percentage of revenue 4% to 5%, and free cash flow to be about $380 million for the full year of 2024 with seasonally stronger free cash flow in Q4. And that, I will hand things back over to Yamini for her closing remarks.\nYamini Rangan: Thank you so much, Kate. To close out, we have a large opportunity ahead of us, and we are well on our way to becoming the number one customer platform for scaling companies. Our pace of innovation is high and our focus on driving usage and value with our customer platform and AI is clear. I look forward to seeing many of you at our Analyst Day at INBOUND on September 18th and sharing the progress we've made this year and the confidence we have in building an enduring company. I want to thank our customers, partners, and investors for their continued support and a huge, huge thank you to all HubSpotters around the world for staying focused on solving for our customers every single day. With that, operator, let's please open up the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question today is from the line of Samad Samana of Jefferies. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nSamad Samana: Great. Thank you. Hi Yamini and Kate and everybody. Thanks as always for the time. Good evening. Hey Yamini, it's great to see the growth sustain and stabilize above 20%. One of the things that we are particularly curious about is where growth has changed the most in the portfolio over the last six months? So, i.e., like how did the growth rates across the main hubs look and have they all slowed in an equal manner. Is there a particular hub where new business growth has reaccelerated or is doing better than expected? Just curious if we can maybe peel that back a little bit. Thank you so much.\nYamini Rangan: Hey Samad, thank you so much for the questions. I appreciate your support as always. I'd say the answer starts with our strategy of becoming a customer platform for our scaling companies. And when we sit on that strategy, we said that we're going to build best-in-class engagement hub. But most importantly, we're going to build a platform that unifies data insights across all of those hubs. And if I were to point to one thing that you're seeing in the last few quarters, it is the multi-hub momentum. And I said this during the prepared remarks, there are more common combinations of multi-hub wins that we're seeing, starting with our front doors of marketing sales, followed by sales marketing and service. And then certainly, this past quarter, we saw more Content Hub attached to the primary hubs. And maybe if I step back and approach this from a customer perspective, our customers acquired a bunch of point solutions, and they are struggling to integrate all of those data points into actionable insights and to control the cost. And they're looking for much better ways to be able to get all of that information into a single platform, and we are that platform of choice. We're able to connect all of the data across marketing, across sales, across service into a single platform. And the power of HubSpot is not just in a specific hub. It's really in the insights that we deliver across multiple hubs the platform. And so if there is a story to take away, there's really that multiple hubs is gaining momentum across the past few quarters.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today is from the line of Mark Murphy of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nMark Murphy: Thank you. I'll add my congrats on very nice execution in a difficult environment. And just continuing on that that point you just made, Yamini, I was wondering if you can update on that phenomenon in terms of traction with your payments product. Since it became one of your primary colors. I'm wondering how the customer activity is evolving there beyond simple payment processing and moving into what you just described, the ability to produce that could, build the line and CRM kind of track it across the whole HubSpot platform maybe kicking off other actions. Is that behavior that you see evolving? And then related to that, just wondering if there is any way you could characterize the payment volume or kind of monetization you're seeing in payments?\nYamini Rangan: Hey, Mark, thanks a lot for that question. I think the way to think about it is exactly the way you posed the question, which is it is part of that connected platform. Everything comes down to that. When we got started in the payments journey, we had a very key hypothesis in terms of the value that we can add to customers. We're bringing commerce data, transaction data, payments data into the CRM is going to be valuable for our customers, and we are certainly seeing that play out in terms of the payments journey. As you know, last year, we expanded payments to be able to support other processes and bring for our customers to bring their own processes like stripe. And that has had the impact of opening up our opportunity and having more customers, more international customers come on to our payments platform. And certainly, from a functionality perspective, we have continued to drive innovation. The bigger area of focus for us this year has been driving product-led growth for our payments. And you can see this within our navigation, you can see it within our product. You can access payments directly from our navigation bar now, and that has continued to improve the discoverability of payments. In terms of payment volume, we've seen really good payments volume. We have seen the monthly transacting customers grow into the thousands, and we're very pleased with the momentum there. And the other thing that we have seen is that when customers transact with HubSpot, the percentage of the revenue that they're flowing through HubSpot is much higher than what we had expected. Now all of this is good, but I would continue to continue to remind that this is a longer-term bet and we are -- while we feel really good with the progress, it is a strategic bet, and we are willing to be very strategically patient as we see continue to see the progress within that. But again, it would come back to the value of our customer platform within each of our hubs as well commerce. Thank you so much for the question.\nOperator: Our next question today is from the line of Brad Sills of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nBrad Sills: Great. Thank you so much, and great to see the progress with the multi-hub deals. I guess, I wanted to go back to a comment that was made earlier in the call that the upgrade environment is challenging. I guess and that's been the reason behind some of the delays here in -- that's macro related in some of the larger deals. I guess on that note, is it also due to the fact that you're seeing these multi-hub deals, more multi-department deals, more strategic kind of deals that could also be requiring more board-level approval, more multi-departmental sign-off that's also causing this delay? In other words, how much of this is macro that's causing some of the delays you're seeing versus the fact that HubSpot is now becoming more of a platform company that is seeing multi-home deals.\nYamini Rangan: Brad, thanks a lot for the question. So in terms of the macro environment, very consistent with what we saw in Q1, and what we described as customer trends is slower decision-making, committee buying and high cone of budgets, certainly requiring Board and other approvals. That does lead to lengthening of the deal cycle, and we talked about that. Now the counter play for that is that as we talk to customers, they want to consolidate on fewer platforms and HubSpot is becoming that platform. So in fact, we see that that there's a lot more value that we can add by providing an organic customer platform. And so actually speeds up the deal. So there's like counterbalancing impact of what we see from the macro to the trend that we see in terms of consolidating to fewer platforms, so I would say that those two play off each other. Broadly, when we talk to customers, even when they are not ready to make a decision, it's mostly not now for HubSpot, and not necessarily a no, and they always come back a few quarters or even a few months after and see the value of consolidating on HubSpot.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Alex Zukin of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nAlex Zukin: Hey, guys thanks for taking the question, and congrats on solid execution in a difficult environment. I want to ask a two-parter, because it occurs to me that just on the margin side, that sequential margin improvement that you guys saw some of the best, I think, you've ever posted. And particularly, if I look at the sales and marketing line, so maybe just walk through kind of where that leverage is coming from, where it can go? And then separately, if you look at your cash position today, $2 billion or so with really, really strong free cash flow generation. As you think more about that consolidation of tools and stack, and maybe, Yamini, your viewpoint given the private market environment and the plethora of assets available there, kind of how HubSpot look at this opportunity set to continue to broaden that value proposition?\nKate Bueker: Maybe I'll start, Yamini, with the margin question, and then you can dive in. Thanks, Alex, although I will note the sharp violations of the one question rule. We were very pleased with the margin performance that we had in Q2. Operating margins did come in a little bit better than we had expected. Revenue came in a little bit better, including some help from FX. And then we had a little -- a modest shift down of expenses from Q2 into the back half of the year. That said, the primary drivers of the year-over-year leverage were really two things. One was improvement on the gross margin side. So our team has had some really nice wins optimizing our core product infrastructure, and you're starting to see the impact there. And as you've noted, we are also continuing to make some progress here on driving go-to-market efficiency. I would note particular strength there in services and support.\nA \u2013 Yamini Rangan: Yeah. And in terms of our strong balance sheet position as well as how we plan to use it. Look, it really comes down to our philosophy that we want to build and beautifully crafted customer platform for customers. Now the traditional playbook has been acquiring your way growth, we think that is detrimental for customers' growth and we have always prioritized customers experience and customer growth. So as we look at potential ways in which we can continue to expand platform, we'll do so organically. We'll certainly look at technology and talent that will allow us to move faster on product innovation, but we will also make sure that we are doing that without disrupting our customers experience and making sure it is really seamless. So we've certainly done things like Clearbit as well as pricing. But in both cases, we have really spent the time to integrated back into the customer platform to deliver on the promise of customer experience. And so you can expect us to continue to do that.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Brent Bracelin of Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nQ \u2013 Brent Bracelin: Thanks for taking the question here. I wanted to go back and touch base around the Generative AI journey here. I think it was about a year ago, you guys first started talking about and integrating AI into the platform. I know early on, we had theaters that, that might be a drag on margins as you take on additional costs. But if I look at margins, gross margins, they've actually gone up in the past year. So what have you learned as you've integrated AI into the platform the opportunity for HubSpot to leverage AI? And what parts of the AI strategy are you confident that it's going to work in other parts of the AI opportunities do you think there's less optimism? Thanks.\nA \u2013 Yamini Rangan: It's a great question. It has been a year plus, and I think we started launching our AI innovation in March last year. And our strategy has been twofold. The first one is that we would embed AI into our hubs and into the whole platform. that is, we're not going to charge a separate cost for AI or build a separate SKU. And the rationale behind that strategic choice was to remove friction for our customers to introduce as much innovation to their day-to-day work and then drive adoption. And if you look at that strategy, it is working. And the best point that I can kind of like say that, that strategy is working is Content Hub. So as you know, we just -- we launched Content Hub as part of spotlight. And if you look at the features that are driving adoption as well as the higher attach rate of Content Hub, it's all AI features. Content Remix our reps, our partners love actually showcasing Content Remix to our customers. And when customers see Content Remix they immediately get like excited and they're beginning to adopt because you can take one piece of content, maybe a written blog and convert that into videos into social posts, into e-mails and it does so beautifully and save customers a ton of time. And so we're finding that our strategy of embedding into the Hub and platform is working well. The second bet that we said is we want to add a ton of value before we begin to monetize value separately. And that is also playing out. Part of what we want to see is repeat usage of customers, and we are definitely seeing traction in Enterprise and Pro tiers, which where we have driven adoption. But we're also going to be very principled about making sure that the value is repeat value before we begin to monetize. And so I think those are things that are working. Look, if I maybe take a step back and say, how is AI developing. There's just a -- it's kind of developing the same way Internet did, it starts with the networking infrastructure layer, it starts with large language models, and it takes a while for application innovation to take place, and we are very quick in terms of innovation, but strategically patient in terms of seeing this technology transformation take shape for our customers.\nDharmesh Shah: Just one quick note to add since we're talking about margins, developments we see in the AI industry overall is this continuous and relatively dramatic reduction in the cost for these flagship models, right? So, we've seen OpenEye has kind of led the field. Cloud team out with a comparable flagship model that's close to GPT. They are Open Source models now. And OpenAI just announced another 30% to 50% reduction in price. So, we're seeing dramatic increase -- decreases in the cost of actually rolling out these AI features. So, we're not anticipating any impact to margin in the near-term.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today is from the line of Gabriela Borges of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nGabriela Borges: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking our questions. Yamini, I wanted to follow-up on the prepared remarks around HubSpot achieving HIPAA compliance. Help us understand how meaningful this milestone is. Is there a way to think about what percentage of deals perhaps you wouldn't be invited to because you because you didn't have HIPPA compliance or how much this expands the TAM opportunity for you now have access to those customers and health current financials? Any color that would be helpful.\nYamini Rangan: Yes, Gabriela, thank you so much for that question. And yes, we are pretty excited about this fairly big milestone, our partners are super excited, our customers are excited about this. And maybe just to take a step back, what we announced in Q2 is that we're making it easy for customers to protect sensitive personal information to be able to support compliance with regulations like GDPR and HIPAA. And what that means is that we will now support audit logging, authentication features, account security recommendations, all of those things that customers need. But more importantly, it is going to help us open up our TAM and be even better at addressing the needs of customers in verticals like healthcare, financial services, and insurance. And this is a super exciting longer-term opportunity, and we think that it's really going to make HubSpot great solution for those verticals and customers with those kinds of use cases. And in terms of Q2, the momentum out of the gate and the customer interest has been very good to see. Majority of the activations are from our enterprise customers, which is really not surprising, because they have the most sophisticated needs in terms of managing sensitive data. We have seen healthy pickup, both in terms of ASP as well as conversion rates in terms of those areas. And so there's a lot more to come, but it certainly makes us an even better fit in larger portions of the market.\nOperator: Our next question today is from the line of Elizabeth Porter of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nElizabeth Porter: Great. Thank you very much for the question. I wanted to ask about the net new customer adds in the quarter. When we back out clear bit from last quarter, it does look like adds improved sequentially. And it sounds like we're starting to see some of the benefit from higher new logos under the new pricing model. So my question is, how should we think about the unlocked volume of new customers under the new pricing model? And any change to the initial view for roughly 10,000 adds per quarter through the year? Thank you.\nKate Bueker: Yes. Thanks, Elizabeth. We are encouraged by another quarter by another quarter of really strong customer additions. And you heard from me in the prepared remarks that the strength was really again driven healthy of additions really at that low end, which is a trend that we've been seeing now for, call it, four to six quarters. We have been said before, I mean, you've heard it from me before, net customer addition is not an input metric for us. It is an output metric. And it's a trend that moves around from quarter-to-quarter. Given the volume is really at that low end, if you think about in any given quarter, we typically would be running multiple experiments within the Star customer base. And the experiments would be from things like optimizing purchase flows, optimizing activation, there may be pricing and packaging plays. There may be funnel demand kind of plays in any quarter. And so it's hard to kind of tease out one impact from another, just given how many different things could be going on. In particular, it's hard to tease out the impact of the new pricing model. What I would highlight is that for Q2, we did see a nice step-up in Pro customer additions, which I would be able to associate or I would assume would associate more directly with the seats model. Now all that said, as I think about the back half of the year, we will start to have a number of pretty large cohorts from a year ago that are that are going to come up for renewal in the next couple of quarters. And sort of given the combination of those large cohorts coming up for renewal and the fact that you've heard from both of Yamini and myself, that we continue to see macro weakness, particularly in small business. My expectation for net adds in the back half of the year is $9 to $10 per quarter.\nOperator: The next question today is from the line of Terry Tillman of Truist. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nDominique Manansala: Hi. This is Dominique Manansala on for Terry. Thanks for the question. So just looking at some of the significant currency moves recently. I'm just curious as to whether your foreign exchange outlook has changed at all? And if you're thinking about any additional hedging strategies?\nKate Bueker: Yes. Thanks so much for the question. You are absolutely right. Currency has been incredibly volatile here over the last period of time. We tried to provide some guidance or some perspective in our guidance at this time last quarter, we were expecting a bit of a tailwind to the full year from currency, I'm sorry, bit of a headwind to the year from currency. And we are basically neutral for the year. In terms of hedging, you'll see in our 10-Q, we have started to do cash flow hedging that has some very modest impact on overall revenue.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Parker Lane of Stifel. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nParker Lane: Yeah. Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Yamini, you cited a bunch of really healthy metrics on the service side of the business, including the 100 plus seat, customer cohort being up 55%. I was wondering if you could talk about maybe two or three of the features that came out as part of the relaunch that are most appealing to those larger customers, and if the composition of the competitors has changed at all, given the number of features you brought to the table.\nYamini Rangan: Yeah. Thank you, Parker, for that question. I am excited aboutthe innovation within Service Hub. And I'm also very excited to see customer adoption. There were probably three big things that happened with the Spotlight and Service Hub relaunch in April. The first is that for the first time, we are actually serving the customer success persona within our customers. And that brings together customer success and support team. We know customer success leaders right now care a lot about retention. And that is why we launched a new workspace specifically for customer success managers to be able to track and manage their book of business, and that's certainly very welcome by our customers. The second is that we did a complete overhaul of help desk, which now has new and unified ticket and conversation interface. And with the new unified help desk interface, we have seen a 200% increase in the portals, closing tickets in help desk and an increase in the number of portals that are closing 20-plus tickets. So it's showing that we are kind of continuing to drive the usage there. And then I would say, maybe the last thing is that it's not one specific enterprise feature, but it's a whole set of features that we have launched like advanced SLAs, more robust routing, better support management, all of which is aimed at serving our up market customers who just need much more sophisticated needs for their support teams. And as you rightly pointed out, that is leading to 100 plus Service Hub seats. But I will also tie this back to my earlier comment about platform. The momentum that we see in Service Hub is not just a hub-specific momentum. It is really the value of having service sales and marketing teams work together and have the single unified view of their customer that is what we are really pleased about.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Ken Wong of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nKen Wong: Great. Appreciate you guys give me a question. Just wanted to circle up on a dynamic you guys called out last quarter where you guys saw a shift towards lower quality leads. Just wondering if that's normalized back to partner source leads? Or is that still an issue you guys are running into?\nYamini Rangan: Ken, thank you so much. Yeah, it is normalized back. It's really in a healthy place right now. And maybe just to step back, in Q1, we shared that we saw a mix shift at the top of the funnel from partner sourced and qualified leads to more of rep-sourced leads that tend to take more time. And we're definitely seeing good progress on the partner as well as the QL side. And maybe just as a little bit more context, there are a couple of ways in which we engage with partners. The first is actually co-selling where the partner team and the HubSpot sales teams work closely together. And that co-selling motion has been doing really well and has been consistently up in the first half of this year. It was up by 71%. The partner sourcing is the other motion where partners actually bring more deals. And this is where we saw a bit of a weakness in Q1. But as soon as we saw that in early Q2, we rolled out clear enablement plays to both partners as well as partner development resources within HubSpot. And we've been laser focused in terms of execution. And based on all of that, we have seen that mix shift back to what we normally would see and what we are happy with. So I feel pretty good about the trends going into second half as well as the mix of demand as we go back into the second half of the year. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Brian C. Peterson of Raymond James. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nQ \u2013 Johnathan McCary: Thank you. This is Johnathan McCary on for Brian. Maybe kind of related to that last question, but I'm curious after a few months now the new pricing model, how would you say the sales reps have adjusted to that? Was there any sort of learning curve they're still in process or was that a relatively seamless transition for the team? Thanks.\nA \u2013 Yamini Rangan: Yeah. Thanks a lot. I think there is a learning curve and our sales teams as well as the partner teams are settling into that seats motion. And as we have said, the changes that we launched as part of this pricing change was to lower the price point to get started with HubSpot, remove the seat minimum so that our customers can upgrade to pro and enterprise without any friction and then create a core seat for customers. And all of that, we expected ASPs to go down and the volume of customer wins to go up and then better upgrades over time. And as you pointed out, this is a slightly different motion for our sales reps. It is a higher velocity motion. So we've been really focused on enabling our reps on the steps that they can take, the qualifications that they do and how they can progress the deals quickly. And we're beginning to see the overall volume offset the ASP. And so we're pleased with the progress, but it's taking a little bit of time and I'm really happy with how our sales teams have responded to the change in motion. But overall, it's progressing as we want it to.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Michael Turrin of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nQ \u2013 Michael Berg: Hey, this is Michael Berg on for Michael Turrin. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask on the new pricing model in a slightly different manner. One of the points you've referred to several times on this call is starter upgrade motion playing up over time. I'm just curious how and what you are seeing today in that motion? And if that has picked up in meaningful amounts since the new pricing model was launched? Thank you.\nA \u2013 Yamini Rangan: Yeah. Thank you so much for the question. We obviously pay a lot of attention to our starter upgrade rates. And I think the good news is that starter cohorts continue to upgrade really at healthy rates, pretty consistent with what we've been seeing over the last few years. Even with the healthier volumes that we have seen over the last few quarters.\nOperator: Our next question today is from the line of Tyler Radke of Citigroup. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nTyler Radke: Thank you for taking the question. Maybe this one for Kate. Can you just help unpack the moving pieces in the full year revenue guide? Obviously, it sounds like currency was a factor that flipped a little bit more positively. But is there any type of incremental softness as it relates to macro or the pricing model in the guide if we just sort of compare your prior guide with the currency and the next -- the quarterly beat as well. Thank you.\nKate Bueker: Yes, I mean, what I would tell you is like we're very pleased with the results in Q2. You heard both Yamini and I say on -- in our prepared remarks that we're seeing the macro weakness persist, been hearing similar sentiments from peer companies who've already announced. And our guidance assumes that the difficult demand environment continues in the back half of the year, but it also does not assume that it gets materially worse, right? As we look to set guidance -- we took a step back in the range of scenarios as part of that process, consistent with what we already -- we always do. And I know that there has been concerns more recently of broader economic challenges, but we have a lot confidence in achieving the guidance that we look forward.\nOperator: Our next question today is from the line of Arjun Bhatia of William Blair. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nArjun Bhatia: Perfect. Yamini, maybe one for you going back to AI a little bit. Can you just help understand where you might see in the product portfolio, AI adoption first or where you are seeing it first? And then more specifically on Service Hub, I also wanted to ask what capabilities you're baking in there? And if there is kind of this shift to self-service from your customers, do you need to change your seat-based pricing model at all in Service Hub or is that that anything you're contemplating? Thank you.\nYamini Rangan: Okay. Multiparter, I'll take the kind of the first part of the question, which is where we've seen adoption momentum and then take the Service Hub separately. So, if I look at our customers, marketing teams have been the leading adopters of AI. And specifically, content use cases have the highest adoption with 65% of our AI users already leveraging content features. I talked a lot about Content Hub. One of the reasons why we doubled down on Content Hub is that we know that content is important to attract customers, but everything in terms of the -- how you create content and how you distribute content has changed. And that was kind of the strategy in terms of Content Hub. So, in terms of AI, we are seeing repeat usage for generating audio from blog, language translation, text editing, writing e-mail summary. So, a lot of the content use cases are the ones that our customers are meaning in. And maybe the more important indicator is that it's just becoming built into their daily workflow. So, that's area number one. I do think Service is the next use case, customers are getting pretty comfortable with leveraging AI for improving resolution times as well as driving self-serve via chatbot. We've seen a 40% repeat usage rate in portals that have activated AI chatbot. And when they are using AI chatbot consistently, we're seeing 30-plus percent resolution rate improvement. So these all are early indicators that there is value and service has a lot more room in terms of continuing to drive value. I don't know, Dharmesh, if you have a comment on Service Hub as well.\nDharmesh Shah: Yes. Just a quick note on the kind of question around seats possible seats pressure. The way we think of it is rolled Generative AI of across the entire engineering team last year. And we think different roles will be impacted differently by Generative AI. And we saw a 20% measurable improvement in productivity across the engineering team. And we don't think that reduces the number of engineers that we're going to want. We have a long multi-decade road map and vision is what we want to do there. On the service side, lots of service orgs are currently kind of managed towards kind of optimizing how many people are necessary to manage a fixed number of customer interactions, how many tickets can we handle and those kinds of things. And as you heard, Yamini note, we're moving this kind of personal shift towards customer success. So we think how this plays out over the long-term is that we're not going to be optimizing for customer interactions. We're going to say, can we have more interactions that are more valuable and kind of lift the overall productivity and value that these customer teams provide. And so our thinking long-term is that, yes, it may reduce the overall headcount, but we think as we add value that we will kind of share our fair share of that value. So we're simply focused on driving more value with AI, making our customers more productive. We think over the fullness of time, that will still play out nicely.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Siti Panigrahi of Mizuho. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nSiti Panigrahi: Thanks for taking my question. And going back to the seat-based pricing changes, you previously talked about this new model being net neutral to ARR for the year. So wondering if you could provide update there? And what are you seeing in terms of the volume versus price dynamics in Q2 and until August -- and is this still a net neutral ARR impact still the expectation?\nKate Bueker: Yes. Thank you Siti for the question. Yes, we are still expecting that the seat model change will be neutral to growth for 2024. As you heard from Yamini, we continue to make progress with the new sales motion, and we're expecting another sequential improvement there in Q3. The other thing we're seeing is really solid expansion trends. We talked about a multi-point increase in our net revenue retention at month three from customers that are on the new model as a result of the fact that they're just purchasing what they need when they get started and they're upgrading in real-time. And that that gives us added confidence in 6 to 8-point increase in net revenue retention for seat-based customers that we shared last quarter.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Kirk Materne of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nKirk Materne: Yes. Thanks very much. Kate, it was actually a very nuance change, but you did pick up CapEx a little bit from 4% to 5%. I'm just curious, is there anything. Is that AI related? I mean, I realize it's a very small absolute number, but just kind of curious how we should read that if there's anything directionally to read into that as we start thinking about 25% as well. Thanks.\nKate Bueker: Yes. No, I appreciate the question. The largest part of our CapEx is actually capitalized software. And there's a couple of things that are driving that tick up from what you noticed as 4% to 5%. One is that we have been investing in an outsized way in our product and engineering organization, and so that would in itself lead to an increase. The other thing that we're seeing is that the share of time that engineering team and product teams are spending on developing new features and functionality is actually increasing, and it's that combination, that's driving that little increase in CapEx.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Eamon Coughlin of Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nEamon Coughlin: Hey, guys. Eamon Coughlin on for Ryan Macwilliams. Thanks for taking the question. In 2Q, can you just maybe touch on the contribution to net retention from pricing seats of tiering and cross-sell? And has this changed for 2Q? And then could this change as the price change rolls through the existing base? Thanks.\nKate Bueker: Yeah. Thanks for the question. Maybe I'm going to take a step back and maybe talk about net revenue retention in general. Just like as a reminder, net revenue retention for the quarter was flat at 102. And we saw really a consistent set of trends that we're influencing net revenue retention for Q2. The first is that we continue to see really strong gross retention in the high 80s. Second, we've been seeing a stabilization over the last few quarters here on downgrades, and we saw that continue into Q2, particularly with season contacts. And then finally, we have been seeing a challenge with our upgrade motions, and we continue to see challenge in quarter with expansion motion. Even though we've seen those early positive signs with the new seat-based pricing model that you talked about. So net-net, we think net new or that net revenue retention is going to remain around 102 give or take a point in the back half of the year and that it's really an external environment improvement and the maturing of that seat-based model that's going to take a few more quarters before we would start seeing something trend up.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Taylor McGinnis of UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nTaylor McGinnis: Yeah. Hi, thanks so much for taking my question. Since there some rounding in the constant currency growth rates and numbers, Kate, are you able to offer a little bit more color on how the second half 2024 constant currency revenue growth guide now compares to the implied second half 2024 constant currency revenue growth guide given last quarter? Because I guess you use like some of the rounded numbers, it would suggest it might be a little lower. So if that's true, can you maybe comment on what might be driving that extra conservatism on the back of what looked like to be a really solid 3Q, and if you are seeing anything at the start of 3Q and the July month, that might be driving some of that. Thanks so much.\nKate Bueker: Yeah. No, I appreciate the question. Let me see if I can clarify a little bit here. Your math is roughly right. Our updated full year guidance is up by $15 million at the midpoint. And this includes a bit more than $10 million of FX benefit in the back half of the year, so based on the latest forecast knowing that FX has been highly volatile. And when you take a step back and I'll reiterate some of the comments that we made in both prepared remarks and an earlier question, the external environment remains challenging. There is a high degree of uncertainty in the macro and foreign exchange market has been incredibly volatile. And so as we always do, we ran a bunch of different scenarios as we evaluated our back half guidance, and we always want to put forward a set of guidance that we feel really confident in our ability to achieve, and I think that's what we did, again, this quarter.\nOperator: Thank you. And the final question in the queue today is from the line of Jackson Ader of KeyCorp. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nQ \u2013 Jackson Ader: Great. Thanks for taking our questions, guys. My question is on, I think we've lapped the initial pilot program on the seed space model from Australia and New Zealand, and so I'm just curious what the behavior is when some of these customers that might have signed annual contracts, what their behavior is upon renewal after that first year? Thank you.\nA \u2013 Yamini Rangan: I mean, look, I think that what we have shared over the last quarter on the pilot program in ANZ still holds, which is we see a strong and healthy customer base because people are buying what they want, they're upgrading as they need it, and we see net revenue retention that at month 12 is 6 to 8 points higher than what we see under the legacy model.\nOperator: Thank you. This will conclude the HubSpot Q2 2024 earnings call. Thank you to everyone who was able to join us today. You may now disconnect your lines.",

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Kate Bueker",
            "content": "Thanks, Yamini. Let's turn to our second quarter 2024 financial results. Q2 revenue grew 21% year-over-year in constant currency and 20% on an as-reported basis. Subscription revenue grew 20% year-over-year, while services and other revenue increased 18% on an as-reported basis. Q2 domestic revenue grew 20% year-over-year. International revenue growth was 22% in constant currency and 21% as reported, now representing 47% of total revenue. We added over 11,200 net customers in Q2 ending the quarter with a total customer count of $228,000, growing 23% year-over-year. Again, this quarter, the strength in customer additions was driven by momentum at the low end. Average subscription revenue per customer was $11,200, down 2% year-over-year in both constant currency and on an as-reported basis. ASRPC continues to be driven by several offsetting factors, a positive impact from an increasing number of professional and enterprise customers adopting multiple hubs, offset by the headwind from the continued strong volume of lower ASP starter customers we've acquired over the last year. Gross retention held nicely in the high 80s and net revenue retention was stable at 102%. While we continue to see strong customer dollar retention and downgrade trends, customer upgrade rates remain challenged, similar to Q1. We expect this behavior to continue in the back half of the year with net revenue retention holding around current levels. Calculated billings were $648 million in Q2, growing 20% year-over-year in both constant currency and on an as-reported basis. The remainder of my comments we'll refer to non-GAAP measures. Q2 operating margin was 17%, up 3 points compared to the year ago period, driven by the continued impact of our go-to-market efficiency and infrastructure optimization efforts. Net income was $104 million in Q2 or $1.94 per fully diluted share. Free cash flow was $92 million in Q2 or 14% of revenue. Finally, our cash and marketable securities totaled $1.9 billion at the end of June. With that, let's review our guidance for the third quarter and full year of 2024. As Yamini shared, we continue to operate in a challenging and volatile external environment. And our guidance assumes that the difficult demand environment persists through the back half of the year, but does not get materially worse. For the third quarter, total as reported revenue is expected to be in the range of $646 million to $647 million, up 16% year-over-year at the midpoint. We expect foreign exchange to be a slight headwind to as reported revenue growth in the quarter. Non-GAAP operating profit is expected to be between $107 million and $108 million. Non-GAAP diluted net income per share $1.89 and $1.91. This assumes 53.5 million fully diluted shares outstanding. And for the full year of 2024, total as-reported revenue is now expected to be in the range of $2.567 billion to $2.57 billion, up 18% year-over-year at the midpoint. We now expect foreign exchange to have a neutral impact to as-reported revenue growth for the full year. Non-GAAP operating profit is now expected to be between $437 million and $441 million. Non-GAAP diluted net income per share is now expected to be to be between $7.64 and $7.70. This assumes 53.4 million fully diluted shares outstanding. As you adjust your models, please keep in mind the following; we now expect CapEx as a percentage of revenue 4% to 5%, and free cash flow to be about $380 million for the full year of 2024 with seasonally stronger free cash flow in Q4. And that, I will hand things back over to Yamini for her closing remarks. Maybe I'll start, Yamini, with the margin question, and then you can dive in. Thanks, Alex, although I will note the sharp violations of the one question rule. We were very pleased with the margin performance that we had in Q2. Operating margins did come in a little bit better than we had expected. Revenue came in a little bit better, including some help from FX. And then we had a little -- a modest shift down of expenses from Q2 into the back half of the year. That said, the primary drivers of the year-over-year leverage were really two things. One was improvement on the gross margin side. So our team has had some really nice wins optimizing our core product infrastructure, and you're starting to see the impact there. And as you've noted, we are also continuing to make some progress here on driving go-to-market efficiency. I would note particular strength there in services and support.\nA \u2013 Yamini Rangan: Yeah. And in terms of our strong balance sheet position as well as how we plan to use it. Look, it really comes down to our philosophy that we want to build and beautifully crafted customer platform for customers. Now the traditional playbook has been acquiring your way growth, we think that is detrimental for customers' growth and we have always prioritized customers experience and customer growth. So as we look at potential ways in which we can continue to expand platform, we'll do so organically. We'll certainly look at technology and talent that will allow us to move faster on product innovation, but we will also make sure that we are doing that without disrupting our customers experience and making sure it is really seamless. So we've certainly done things like Clearbit as well as pricing. But in both cases, we have really spent the time to integrated back into the customer platform to deliver on the promise of customer experience. And so you can expect us to continue to do that. Yes. Thanks, Elizabeth. We are encouraged by another quarter by another quarter of really strong customer additions. And you heard from me in the prepared remarks that the strength was really again driven healthy of additions really at that low end, which is a trend that we've been seeing now for, call it, four to six quarters. We have been said before, I mean, you've heard it from me before, net customer addition is not an input metric for us. It is an output metric. And it's a trend that moves around from quarter-to-quarter. Given the volume is really at that low end, if you think about in any given quarter, we typically would be running multiple experiments within the Star customer base. And the experiments would be from things like optimizing purchase flows, optimizing activation, there may be pricing and packaging plays. There may be funnel demand kind of plays in any quarter. And so it's hard to kind of tease out one impact from another, just given how many different things could be going on. In particular, it's hard to tease out the impact of the new pricing model. What I would highlight is that for Q2, we did see a nice step-up in Pro customer additions, which I would be able to associate or I would assume would associate more directly with the seats model. Now all that said, as I think about the back half of the year, we will start to have a number of pretty large cohorts from a year ago that are that are going to come up for renewal in the next couple of quarters. And sort of given the combination of those large cohorts coming up for renewal and the fact that you've heard from both of Yamini and myself, that we continue to see macro weakness, particularly in small business. My expectation for net adds in the back half of the year is $9 to $10 per quarter. Yes. Thanks so much for the question. You are absolutely right. Currency has been incredibly volatile here over the last period of time. We tried to provide some guidance or some perspective in our guidance at this time last quarter, we were expecting a bit of a tailwind to the full year from currency, I'm sorry, bit of a headwind to the year from currency. And we are basically neutral for the year. In terms of hedging, you'll see in our 10-Q, we have started to do cash flow hedging that has some very modest impact on overall revenue. Yes, I mean, what I would tell you is like we're very pleased with the results in Q2. You heard both Yamini and I say on -- in our prepared remarks that we're seeing the macro weakness persist, been hearing similar sentiments from peer companies who've already announced. And our guidance assumes that the difficult demand environment continues in the back half of the year, but it also does not assume that it gets materially worse, right? As we look to set guidance -- we took a step back in the range of scenarios as part of that process, consistent with what we already -- we always do. And I know that there has been concerns more recently of broader economic challenges, but we have a lot confidence in achieving the guidance that we look forward. Yes. Thank you Siti for the question. Yes, we are still expecting that the seat model change will be neutral to growth for 2024. As you heard from Yamini, we continue to make progress with the new sales motion, and we're expecting another sequential improvement there in Q3. The other thing we're seeing is really solid expansion trends. We talked about a multi-point increase in our net revenue retention at month three from customers that are on the new model as a result of the fact that they're just purchasing what they need when they get started and they're upgrading in real-time. And that that gives us added confidence in 6 to 8-point increase in net revenue retention for seat-based customers that we shared last quarter. Yes. No, I appreciate the question. The largest part of our CapEx is actually capitalized software. And there's a couple of things that are driving that tick up from what you noticed as 4% to 5%. One is that we have been investing in an outsized way in our product and engineering organization, and so that would in itself lead to an increase. The other thing that we're seeing is that the share of time that engineering team and product teams are spending on developing new features and functionality is actually increasing, and it's that combination, that's driving that little increase in CapEx. Yeah. Thanks for the question. Maybe I'm going to take a step back and maybe talk about net revenue retention in general. Just like as a reminder, net revenue retention for the quarter was flat at 102. And we saw really a consistent set of trends that we're influencing net revenue retention for Q2. The first is that we continue to see really strong gross retention in the high 80s. Second, we've been seeing a stabilization over the last few quarters here on downgrades, and we saw that continue into Q2, particularly with season contacts. And then finally, we have been seeing a challenge with our upgrade motions, and we continue to see challenge in quarter with expansion motion. Even though we've seen those early positive signs with the new seat-based pricing model that you talked about. So net-net, we think net new or that net revenue retention is going to remain around 102 give or take a point in the back half of the year and that it's really an external environment improvement and the maturing of that seat-based model that's going to take a few more quarters before we would start seeing something trend up. Yeah. No, I appreciate the question. Let me see if I can clarify a little bit here. Your math is roughly right. Our updated full year guidance is up by $15 million at the midpoint. And this includes a bit more than $10 million of FX benefit in the back half of the year, so based on the latest forecast knowing that FX has been highly volatile. And when you take a step back and I'll reiterate some of the comments that we made in both prepared remarks and an earlier question, the external environment remains challenging. There is a high degree of uncertainty in the macro and foreign exchange market has been incredibly volatile. And so as we always do, we ran a bunch of different scenarios as we evaluated our back half guidance, and we always want to put forward a set of guidance that we feel really confident in our ability to achieve, and I think that's what we did, again, this quarter."

            "content": "Thank you, Ryan, and welcome to everyone on the call. Today, I'll share our Q2 2024 results, discuss trends driving our momentum, and highlight early wins from our Spring Spotlight product launches. I'll also reiterate our strategy and playbook for winning both in the short and long-term. Let's dive in. Q2 was a solid quarter for HubSpot with revenue growing 21% year-over-year in constant currency. We delivered another quarter of operating margin growth with 270 basis points of margin expansion year-over-year, driving our operating margin to 17%. I'm really happy with the operating leverage we are continuing to deliver, while driving growth. Total customers grew to 228,000 customers globally, driven by over 11,200 net customer additions in the quarter. I'm thrilled to see customers consolidating on HubSpot, the consistent focus on innovation and execution demonstrated by our teams, and momentum we have in becoming the customer platform of choice for scaling companies. Our started year continues to fuel volume on the low end of the market, driven by product and pricing improvements. We have removed friction and have made it easy for customers to get started with HubSpot. We've streamlined the checkout process, so customers can now make clearer decisions about the functionality and seats they need. But most importantly, we're delivering compelling value for business owners focused on driving growth and meeting better visibility on customer trends in this environment. As a result, we're seeing strength in free sign-ups and starter ads. In up markets, our Q2 results were driven by multi-hub and large deal momentum. We saw more customers start with or expand into multiple hubs, resulting in larger deals. Over 45% of new business in our polls tiers came from customers using three or more hubs. Within customers adopting multiple hubs, we saw three popular combinations. Marketing and sales hubs our main front doors, marketing sales and Service Hubs, innovation in Service Hub is driving momentum and marketing sales from Content Hub after content Hub launch in April. The higher mix of multi-hub deals and the momentum we have with upmarket customers led to larger wins in Q2. Upmarket customers want to simplify and consolidate their tech stack and our focused investments to serve their needs and our pace of innovation make off their top choice. Okay. Let's talk about our pricing model changes that we introduced in early March and how it's progressing. As a reminder, we lowered the price point to get started with HubSpot removed seat minimums to reduce friction to upgrade and created a core seat for customers who want to edit CRM records. We did this to make HubSpot easy to buy and easy to grow with. When we made these changes, we expected it to lead to lower initial ASP, higher volume of customers and more upgrades and expansion over time. In Q2, we continue to make progress on driving higher volume to offset the ASP declines and expect this to happen in the next few months as we focus on enablement. We continue to see solid expansion trends with a multipoint increase in net revenue retention rate at month three for customers on the new pricing model as they buy exactly what they and expand when they need more. Overall, we continue to have high conviction that the pricing change is the right decision for our customers and therefore, for HubSpot. To round out Q2, let's talk about the innovation we drove with our Spring Spotlight product launches and how they're driving momentum. In April, as part of our first Spring Spotlight, we introduced major updates to Service Hub and launched Content Hub. The Service Hub update was a big unlock. It now supports both customer support and customer success teams on a single unified platform. We saw the number of wins with 100-plus service seats grew 55% year-over-year and 30% year-to-date. In addition, we saw a 200% increase in portals closing ticket in help desk since the relaunch. In terms of Content Hub, our goal is to provide an AI-powered content marketing solution that can help marketeers create and manage content. And the response has been fantastic. The attach rate for Content Hub to Marketing Hub has tripled since the launch and is now nearly 50% for new marketing hub wins. This high attach rate is being driven by innovative AI features like content remix, AI blogs and brand voice. Brands like Tripadvisor, World Widelife Fund for Nature and Morehouse College, are all using HubSpot content solutions to grow. Overall, we're thrilled to see our product innovation drive value for our customers. Okay. On to the macro environment. We're seeing the same trends as last year and Q1, slower decision-making, more decision-makers involved and scrutiny on business case and value before spending. When decisions are made by committees, that often includes CEOs, CFOs, CROs, and many times require Board or BCP firm approval. The bar for buying continues to be high. We also see companies consolidating on fewer platforms that can help them grow. We're executing on our clear and proven playbook to drive growth in this environment. Let me step back and connect the dots on our playbook, where we are seeing momentum this year and how this sets us up for both short and long-term success. Our playbook for executing in any macro is clear. We solve our customers, help them grow by providing an AI-powered customer platform and drive the pace innovation that can make it easy for customers to stay ahead. HubSpot Excel when we know exactly who we are serving, and we have never been more clear. We are determined to delight growth professionals in marketing sales and service at scaling companies and to help them grow. This focus on solving for our customers and deep listening have resulted in clear momentum in customer acquisition. More importantly, it has led to strong retention with customer dollar retention consistently in the high 80s. As a company, we're doubling down our focus on our customers and are energized about helping them grow. The way we help them grow is by providing an AI-powered customer platform, which includes best-in-class engagement hubs, Smart CRM, which unifies customer data and teams and a connected ecosystem with app and solution partners. This platform strategy is working as more customers consolidate on HubSpot to lower cost and drive growth. In June, we crossed over one million active app integrations installed by Pro plus customers with more than 35% of them using 10 or more active app integration. Customers are bringing more data together within HubSpot and driving more insights from that data. In addition, we made a choice to embed AI in all of our hubs and within our Smart CRM, and this strategy is beginning to work. The early traction with Content Hub and the step change attach rate of Content Hub to Marketing Hub is just one example of the strategy working. According to our customer Sandler, HubSpot AI has been a game changer for our marketing and sales teams, helping both groups create personalization at scale with messaging, actionable insights and increasing new prospect engagement with our brand by 25%. Customers have an appetite to drive more growth powered by AI, and that's where we are focusing our efforts. In addition, we expanded support for sensitive data, which moved into beta in Q2. HubSpot's sensitive data solution makes it easy for customers to protect sensitive personal information to support their compliance with regulations like GDPR. This expands our opportunity to serve more customers in industries like health care, financial services and insurance, and makes it easy for customers to manage complex compliance processes. Early adoption looks promising, existing enterprise customers are using new features to manage sensitive data, and they're seeing higher conversion rates and average selling prices with new customers. Our pace of innovation and focused execution have been crucial to our success now and will help us grow in the long-term. Reflecting on our results and progress, our strategy is working. I hope that it is abundantly clear we run our business for the long-term and are focused on solving for our customers, innovating our platform and prioritizing strong execution. This has been and will continue to be our priority. And that is what will continue to set us apart to drive durable growth and create long-term shareholder value. With that, I'll turn the call over to Kate to take you through our Q2 financial results. Kate? Thank you so much, Kate. To close out, we have a large opportunity ahead of us, and we are well on our way to becoming the number one customer platform for scaling companies. Our pace of innovation is high and our focus on driving usage and value with our customer platform and AI is clear. I look forward to seeing many of you at our Analyst Day at INBOUND on September 18th and sharing the progress we've made this year and the confidence we have in building an enduring company. I want to thank our customers, partners, and investors for their continued support and a huge, huge thank you to all HubSpotters around the world for staying focused on solving for our customers every single day. With that, operator, let's please open up the call for questions. Hey Samad, thank you so much for the questions. I appreciate your support as always. I'd say the answer starts with our strategy of becoming a customer platform for our scaling companies. And when we sit on that strategy, we said that we're going to build best-in-class engagement hub. But most importantly, we're going to build a platform that unifies data insights across all of those hubs. And if I were to point to one thing that you're seeing in the last few quarters, it is the multi-hub momentum. And I said this during the prepared remarks, there are more common combinations of multi-hub wins that we're seeing, starting with our front doors of marketing sales, followed by sales marketing and service. And then certainly, this past quarter, we saw more Content Hub attached to the primary hubs. And maybe if I step back and approach this from a customer perspective, our customers acquired a bunch of point solutions, and they are struggling to integrate all of those data points into actionable insights and to control the cost. And they're looking for much better ways to be able to get all of that information into a single platform, and we are that platform of choice. We're able to connect all of the data across marketing, across sales, across service into a single platform. And the power of HubSpot is not just in a specific hub. It's really in the insights that we deliver across multiple hubs the platform. And so if there is a story to take away, there's really that multiple hubs is gaining momentum across the past few quarters. Hey, Mark, thanks a lot for that question. I think the way to think about it is exactly the way you posed the question, which is it is part of that connected platform. Everything comes down to that. When we got started in the payments journey, we had a very key hypothesis in terms of the value that we can add to customers. We're bringing commerce data, transaction data, payments data into the CRM is going to be valuable for our customers, and we are certainly seeing that play out in terms of the payments journey. As you know, last year, we expanded payments to be able to support other processes and bring for our customers to bring their own processes like stripe. And that has had the impact of opening up our opportunity and having more customers, more international customers come on to our payments platform. And certainly, from a functionality perspective, we have continued to drive innovation. The bigger area of focus for us this year has been driving product-led growth for our payments. And you can see this within our navigation, you can see it within our product. You can access payments directly from our navigation bar now, and that has continued to improve the discoverability of payments. In terms of payment volume, we've seen really good payments volume. We have seen the monthly transacting customers grow into the thousands, and we're very pleased with the momentum there. And the other thing that we have seen is that when customers transact with HubSpot, the percentage of the revenue that they're flowing through HubSpot is much higher than what we had expected. Now all of this is good, but I would continue to continue to remind that this is a longer-term bet and we are -- while we feel really good with the progress, it is a strategic bet, and we are willing to be very strategically patient as we see continue to see the progress within that. But again, it would come back to the value of our customer platform within each of our hubs as well commerce. Thank you so much for the question. Brad, thanks a lot for the question. So in terms of the macro environment, very consistent with what we saw in Q1, and what we described as customer trends is slower decision-making, committee buying and high cone of budgets, certainly requiring Board and other approvals. That does lead to lengthening of the deal cycle, and we talked about that. Now the counter play for that is that as we talk to customers, they want to consolidate on fewer platforms and HubSpot is becoming that platform. So in fact, we see that that there's a lot more value that we can add by providing an organic customer platform. And so actually speeds up the deal. So there's like counterbalancing impact of what we see from the macro to the trend that we see in terms of consolidating to fewer platforms, so I would say that those two play off each other. Broadly, when we talk to customers, even when they are not ready to make a decision, it's mostly not now for HubSpot, and not necessarily a no, and they always come back a few quarters or even a few months after and see the value of consolidating on HubSpot. Yes, Gabriela, thank you so much for that question. And yes, we are pretty excited about this fairly big milestone, our partners are super excited, our customers are excited about this. And maybe just to take a step back, what we announced in Q2 is that we're making it easy for customers to protect sensitive personal information to be able to support compliance with regulations like GDPR and HIPAA. And what that means is that we will now support audit logging, authentication features, account security recommendations, all of those things that customers need. But more importantly, it is going to help us open up our TAM and be even better at addressing the needs of customers in verticals like healthcare, financial services, and insurance. And this is a super exciting longer-term opportunity, and we think that it's really going to make HubSpot great solution for those verticals and customers with those kinds of use cases. And in terms of Q2, the momentum out of the gate and the customer interest has been very good to see. Majority of the activations are from our enterprise customers, which is really not surprising, because they have the most sophisticated needs in terms of managing sensitive data. We have seen healthy pickup, both in terms of ASP as well as conversion rates in terms of those areas. And so there's a lot more to come, but it certainly makes us an even better fit in larger portions of the market. Yeah. Thank you, Parker, for that question. I am excited aboutthe innovation within Service Hub. And I'm also very excited to see customer adoption. There were probably three big things that happened with the Spotlight and Service Hub relaunch in April. The first is that for the first time, we are actually serving the customer success persona within our customers. And that brings together customer success and support team. We know customer success leaders right now care a lot about retention. And that is why we launched a new workspace specifically for customer success managers to be able to track and manage their book of business, and that's certainly very welcome by our customers. The second is that we did a complete overhaul of help desk, which now has new and unified ticket and conversation interface. And with the new unified help desk interface, we have seen a 200% increase in the portals, closing tickets in help desk and an increase in the number of portals that are closing 20-plus tickets. So it's showing that we are kind of continuing to drive the usage there. And then I would say, maybe the last thing is that it's not one specific enterprise feature, but it's a whole set of features that we have launched like advanced SLAs, more robust routing, better support management, all of which is aimed at serving our up market customers who just need much more sophisticated needs for their support teams. And as you rightly pointed out, that is leading to 100 plus Service Hub seats. But I will also tie this back to my earlier comment about platform. The momentum that we see in Service Hub is not just a hub-specific momentum. It is really the value of having service sales and marketing teams work together and have the single unified view of their customer that is what we are really pleased about. Ken, thank you so much. Yeah, it is normalized back. It's really in a healthy place right now. And maybe just to step back, in Q1, we shared that we saw a mix shift at the top of the funnel from partner sourced and qualified leads to more of rep-sourced leads that tend to take more time. And we're definitely seeing good progress on the partner as well as the QL side. And maybe just as a little bit more context, there are a couple of ways in which we engage with partners. The first is actually co-selling where the partner team and the HubSpot sales teams work closely together. And that co-selling motion has been doing really well and has been consistently up in the first half of this year. It was up by 71%. The partner sourcing is the other motion where partners actually bring more deals. And this is where we saw a bit of a weakness in Q1. But as soon as we saw that in early Q2, we rolled out clear enablement plays to both partners as well as partner development resources within HubSpot. And we've been laser focused in terms of execution. And based on all of that, we have seen that mix shift back to what we normally would see and what we are happy with. So I feel pretty good about the trends going into second half as well as the mix of demand as we go back into the second half of the year. Thank you. Okay. Multiparter, I'll take the kind of the first part of the question, which is where we've seen adoption momentum and then take the Service Hub separately. So, if I look at our customers, marketing teams have been the leading adopters of AI. And specifically, content use cases have the highest adoption with 65% of our AI users already leveraging content features. I talked a lot about Content Hub. One of the reasons why we doubled down on Content Hub is that we know that content is important to attract customers, but everything in terms of the -- how you create content and how you distribute content has changed. And that was kind of the strategy in terms of Content Hub. So, in terms of AI, we are seeing repeat usage for generating audio from blog, language translation, text editing, writing e-mail summary. So, a lot of the content use cases are the ones that our customers are meaning in. And maybe the more important indicator is that it's just becoming built into their daily workflow. So, that's area number one. I do think Service is the next use case, customers are getting pretty comfortable with leveraging AI for improving resolution times as well as driving self-serve via chatbot. We've seen a 40% repeat usage rate in portals that have activated AI chatbot. And when they are using AI chatbot consistently, we're seeing 30-plus percent resolution rate improvement. So these all are early indicators that there is value and service has a lot more room in terms of continuing to drive value. I don't know, Dharmesh, if you have a comment on Service Hub as well."

Yamini? \nYamini Rangan: Thank you, Ryan, and welcome to everyone joining us on the call. I'll begin by sharing our Q1 2024 results, update you on what we are seeing from a demand perspective and wrap up by highlighting our recent product launches from the Spring Spotlight and our ongoing efforts to accelerate innovation for our customers.  \n We kicked off the year with solid revenue growth of 23% year-over-year in constant currency. We delivered another good quarter of operating margin growth with 120 basis points of margin expansion year-over-year, driving our operating margin to 15%. Total customers grew by 22% year-over-year to over 215,000 customers globally, driven by over 11,700 net customer additions in the quarter. I am thrilled to see more customers consolidating on HubSpot as their preferred customer platform for growth.  \n Our Q1 results highlight consistency in why we win.  Customers across all segments are consolidating on HubSpot because it is easy to use, easy to scale and delivers fast time to value. In the lower end of our segment, we saw continued strength in net customer additions driven by free users upgrading to Starter and pricing optimization plays, including our seats model change, driving Starter and pro customer growth.  \n In upmarket, the big themes of the quarter were continued strength in Sales Hub and multi-hub as customers consolidate on HubSpot as their platform of choice. Sales Hub is emerging as a clear winner driven by the innovative features we launched at INBOUND. Our customers are adopting the new prospecting workspace and advanced sequences as a way to drive better alignment between marketing and sales. \n In addition, we have opened up our Smart CRM to support UI customization, deliver broader governance and permission capability and deeper integrations like the sync with LinkedIn Sales Navigator, which is driving up-market momentum.  \n Our land and expand strategy is working, and we have 3 main front doors for customers. Marketing Hub, our original hub, where we continue to innovate. Sales Hub, where we see huge momentum. And multi-hub as customers consolidate on HubSpot. Over 35% of Pro+ customers are now on 3 or more hubs, and we have more room for growth as we drive innovation. We're thrilled to see the continued momentum in Sales Hub and multi-hub and it's a clear validation that our strategy of going from app to suite to customer platform is working.\n Switching gears to macro. After a strong finish in Q4, we saw a return to weaker demand conditions in the first quarter, similar to what we experienced in 2023. The buyer urgency that we saw in December did not carry over into Q1. Instead, we saw a return to higher scrutiny of budgets, more decision-makers getting involved and a need for more demos and proof-of-concepts before signing on purchase decisions. At the top of the funnel, we saw lead flows shift away from higher quality inbound and partner-sourced leads to lower quality rep source leads. This shift plus the lower buyer urgency slowed down deal progression and, in some cases, push deals out of Q1 and into Q2. While deal close and upgrade rates remain under pressure, we continue to see strong customer dollar retention in the high 80s, which underscores the value that our unified customer platform delivers for our customers.\n Now for an update on seats. In early March, we introduced a pricing change based on seats to lower the price points to get started with HubSpot and remove the pricing friction for customers to upgrade from Starter to Professional edition. While we continue to be very excited about the model change for our customers on HubSpot, the timing and speed of the change caused a negative impact on our business in March that will likely persist for a couple of months. As a reminder, we expected this change to lead to lower initial ASP, higher volume of customers and higher rates of upgrades over time.  \n In March, we saw faster adoption of the seats model by customers, which led to a more immediate impact of lower ASPs, but a slower pickup in the volume of new customers. We're seeing more positive trends in April, but it's going to take a few months for the higher volume of additions to offset the initial lower price. \n Having said that, I want to be clear that we have high conviction that seats pricing change is the right decision for our customers as it will allow them to get started and scale more easily with HubSpot. And it is the right decision for HubSpot as it will allow us to bring many more customers onto our platform, grow our net revenue retention rate as customers add more seats over time and align pricing with the value we are creating from our AI-powered Smart CRM. \n Okay. Let's talk about product innovation, which has been a consistent theme over the past few years and gives me high confidence in our ability to drive durable growth. The pace of innovation has accelerated in our industry with AI, and we are setting that pace for scaling companies. Innovation is happening in days and weeks, not months or years. Marketing, sales and service teams are going through a major technology shift. But keeping up with that innovation can be a full-time job in and of itself. \n So to make it easy for our customers to stay ahead, we've decided to have not 1 but 2 big launches each year, INBOUND and Spring Spotlight. You all have seen INBOUND and our customers love the innovation that comes out each year. In April, we launched our first Spring Spotlight that featured over 100 new product releases with over 70 AI features. And we saw over 200 million earned media impressions and nearly double the engagement rate on social channels compared to INBOUND 2023. Super exciting.\n I want to highlight 3 big areas of innovation from our Spring Spotlight for you: Content Hub, Service Hub and HubSpot AI. HubSpot give marketeers a better way to grow with INBOUND marketing, and we are now doing it again by reinventing content marketing. We're taking CMS Hub, which used to be about website and digital presence and transforming it into Content Hub, powered by AI to create and manage content across the entire customer journey. \n As part of Content Hub, we launched AI content creation to make it easy to create multilingual content. Content remix to make it easy to create full pipeline of content based on a single asset.  And brand voice to make it easy to generate content that has consistent brand voice. \n Our goal is simple. We want AI to power every content use case and light the way into the future of content marketing.\n Let's talk about Service Hub. I'm really excited about the innovation here. We believe that delighting current customers is even more important than acquiring new customers. So we're relaunching Service Hub to bring customers support and customer success teams together. To help scale customer support, Service Hub now includes advanced SLAs, more robust routing and support management tools. \n To help customer success teams drive retention, we launched a new customer success workspace that can help CSM handle their task, track their pipeline and see customer health scores with clear next steps. \n Service Hub now includes more than a dozen AI-powered tools like GPT-powered chatbot, real-time recommendations and call summaries to speed up resolution. We're embedding AI to make Service Hub even more valuable and delivering a unified customer platform. As one of our customers [indiscernible] said, \"By bringing marketing sales and service teams together on HubSpot, we're removing the guesswork for our leaders and giving them the confidence that customers are getting what they need.\"\n As we set the pace of innovation with AI embedded across all hubs and our customer platform, we are keenly focused on driving adoption and usage. Adoption has continued to increase with over 50% of enterprise portal using AI features along with over 25% of Pro portals. \n Customers are leveraging AI for personalized content generation, call summarization and are automating their go-to-market motions to drive productivity and growth. There is a lot more room to drive repeat usage, and we are laser-focused on helping our customers grow with HubSpot AI.\n Overall, we're still in the early innings of transforming from a suite to a customer platform. We're becoming the de facto standard for scaling companies, and we are setting the pace of innovation with AI. This gives me confidence in our ability to drive long-term durable growth. \n With that, I'll hand it over to our CFO, Kate Bueker, to take you through our financial and operating results. \nKathryn Bueker: Thanks, Yamini. Let's turn to our first quarter 2024 financial results. Q1 revenue grew 23% year-over-year in both constant currency and on an as-reported basis. Q1 subscription revenue grew 23% year-over-year, while services and other revenue increased 15% on an as-reported basis. Q1 domestic revenue grew 21% year-over-year. International revenue growth was 24% in constant currency and 25% as reported, now representing 47% of total revenue. \n We added over 11,700 net new customers in the quarter, including the onetime addition of nearly 800 customers from the acquisition of Clearbit. This brings our total customer count to over 215,000, growing 22% year-over-year, fueled by our continued strong Starter customer additions. \n Average subscription revenue per customer was $11,400, flat in constant currency and up 1% year-over-year on an as-reported basis. We continue to see a positive impact on ASPs from multi-hub adoption of our professional and enterprise customers, offsetting the impact of large new cohorts of low ASP Starter customers in recent periods. In addition, Clearbit added approximately a 1 point benefit to ASP in Q1. \n As I shared in February, we expect to maintain net customer additions around 10,000 per quarter throughout 2024 with ASRPC down low single digits in constant currency.  \n Gross retention held in the high 80s in Q1, and net revenue retention was 101% or 102% if you remove the impact of Clearbit in the quarter. While we have seen a stabilization in downgrade rates over the last couple of quarters, customer upgrade rates were more challenged in Q1. We expect similar trends to continue in the near term with net revenue retention holding around current levels throughout 2024. Calculated billings were $641 million in Q1, growing 22% year-over-year in constant currency and 20% as reported. The remainder of my comments will refer to non-GAAP measures.\n Q1 operating margin was 15%, up 1 point compared to the year ago period. We continue to see solid progress towards our intermediate operating margin targets across the business. Net income was $89 million in Q1 or $1.68 per fully diluted share. \n Free cash flow was $104 million in Q1 or 17% of revenue. \n Finally, our cash and marketable securities totaled $1.8 billion at the end of March.\n In connection with the quarter close, we discovered an error in our calculation of cost of goods sold related to how we calculate a credit in our hosting agreement with AWS. As a result, we overstated our subscription cost of goods sold by a total of $14 million since Q4 of 2021. Calculating this credit correctly resulted in a $2 million pickup to operating income in each of Q1 2024, in Q1 2023. \n As you update your models, you should assume a positive $6 million contribution to operating income for the remainder of the year, which is included in our guidance. This had no impact on revenue, ARR, operating cash flow and free cash flow in the current or prior periods. \n We have concluded it was not material to prior periods and we'll be correcting the relevant financial statements for comparative purposes in our upcoming 10-Q, which we expect to file on Friday, May 10.\n Before we dive into guidance, I wanted to touch quickly on the macro environment. As Yamini shared, we continue to operate in a challenging external environment and the buyer urgency we saw in December did not carry over into Q1. Customer decision-making is measured and budgets remain tight. Our guidance assumes that these weak conditions persist through 2024.\n Now let's review our guidance for the second quarter and full year of 2024. For the second quarter, total as reported revenue is expected to be in the range of $617 million to $619 million, up 17% year-over-year at the midpoint. We expect foreign exchange to be a 1 point headwind to as-reported revenue growth in the quarter. \n Non-GAAP operating profit is expected to be between $92 million and $93 million. Non-GAAP diluted net income per share is expected to be between $1.62 and $1.64. This assumes 53.3 million fully diluted shares outstanding. \n And for the full year of 2024, total as reported revenue is expected to be in the range of $2.55 billion to $2.56 billion, up 18% year-over-year at the midpoint and consistent with our prior guidance. \n We now expect foreign exchange to be roughly a 1 point headwind to as-reported revenue growth for the full year. \n Non-GAAP operating profit is now expected to be between $426 million and $430 million. Non-GAAP diluted net income per share is now expected to be between $7.30 and $7.38. This assumes 53.5 million fully diluted shares outstanding.\n As you adjust your models, please keep in mind the following. We still expect CapEx as a percentage of revenue to be roughly 4% and free cash flow to be about $365 million for the full year of 2024, with seasonally stronger free cash flow in Q4.\n And with that, I will hand things back over to Yamini for her closing remarks. \nYamini Rangan: Thank you so much, Kate. I want to close by sharing what keeps us grounded and excited about the future. We crown ourselves on not what is changing today but what will not change for our customers. Our customers will need easy-to-use solutions that can help them grow. Our customers will need us to drive innovation so that they can compete with bigger companies in the age of AI. This is exactly what we are focused on. \n Our customer platform is gaining momentum with more front doors like Sales Hub and multi-hub, and they remain focused on a massive opportunity to help millions of organizations grow.\n Okay. I want to thank our customers, partners and investors for their continued support. And a huge thank you to all HubSpotters around the world for staying focused on solving for our customers every single day. \n With that, operator, let's please open up the call for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions]   And our first question is from the line of Samad Samana of Jefferies. \nSamad Samana: It's great to see the healthy growth for HubSpot. A lot of other SMB software vendors have struggled and Hubs has been able to maintain that durable 20% plus growth. So it's good to see that. Can you help us understand how much of that is more traction with larger customers offsetting SMB weakness? And if that's the case, as we think through the rest of 2024, can market share gains in that 500 to 5,000 employee segment of the market keep powering this durable growth? \nYamini Rangan: Samad, thank you so much for the question. Look, I think we're still operating in a very cautious buying environment. And we continue to see that caution across all of the segments within our customer base. Having said that, within the environment, customers are consolidating on fewer platforms, and we are the platform of choice for customers within this environment. That's why we have continuously leaned in on lower total cost of ownership, higher value, faster time to value, and that's been our playbook throughout kind of the soft period from a macro perspective. \n Now you asked kind of what we see in the 500 to 2,000 segment versus the lower environment, we're seeing kind of cautious strength in both, right? In the lower environment, we are removing friction. We are lowering the price and we are increasing the value. And if you look at the entire customer platform that we deliver for a Starter suite customer, it is an exceptionally compelling value proposition, which is why we continue to see the net adds gain strength there. \n And more importantly, what we really look for is when people buy HubSpot, they stay with HubSpot, which we see in that high 80s customer dollar retention. \n In terms of upper end of the segment, it is time to value. The number of conversations that I have with upmarket customers where they care about getting up and running and getting their teams using a customer platform in a few weeks instead of waiting for 8 months, 10 months, which is what happens with other legacy platforms, that is the reason we win. And we are doubling down in product innovation, but also doubling down in delivering the fast time to value. \n So it continues to be a hot environment, but we think it's -- in terms of durable growth,  we are doing all of the right things in terms of going from app to suite to a platform. We're focused across all of the segments, and we are continuously focused on innovation with AI and embedding it into the platform. \nOperator: Our next question today is from the line of Mark Murphy of JPMorgan. \nMark Murphy: So I'm curious if you have any sense of the underlying driver of the buyer urgency having picked up in December and then weakening during Q1, it seems like a bit of a quick oscillation there. And just in terms of the buyer behavior year-to-date, how does it feel if you compare it to 1 year ago when we were a little closer to the trend line changes for interest rates and inflation? \nYamini Rangan: Mark, this is Yamini. Thank you for the question. Let me share kind of what we saw and maybe provide some contrast across the different periods that you mentioned. We saw choppiness in the environment in Q1. And very specifically, we saw tight budgets, more decision-makers, more meetings, more demos. And even for the first time, more proof of concepts before customers got ready to make purchase decisions. \n And as I mentioned before, this was different than what we saw in December, even accounting for the seasonality differences between Q4 and Q1, December felt more like an anomaly and it felt like in Q1 we are back to a very cautious buying environment. Now it certainly could be what you mentioned, which is just caution in terms of interest rates in the environment. So it felt more like what we saw throughout 2023, and December felt like an anomaly. \n So look, we know that month-to-month, quarter-to-quarter, the environment might look different, that's why we have consistently leaned on the same playbook, which is, in our case, the playbook is communicating business value, communicating the value of consolidating and lowering the TCO and driving a product road map, which is built in with innovation, so we continue to deliver the needs for the customers across these segments. \nOperator: Our next question today is from the line of Alex Zukin of Wolfe Research. \nAleksandr Zukin: I guess I wanted to maybe dig in a little bit on parsing macro versus micro, if you think about buying urgency, sales cycles, demos, POCs and you separate that by SMB versus maybe upper market. Are you -- did you feel like the pricing change maybe elongated sales cycles at all? And then just a clarifying question for Kate. Any idea of Clearbit contributions to revenue and billings in the quarter? \nYamini Rangan: Yes. I'll take that first question, Alex, in terms of parsing macro and pricing. So we talked about the seats change. We launched the seats change in March. And what we specifically saw was a faster adoption by customers of the seats driving model. And compared to what we saw in ANZ and compared to what we saw in our pilot, we saw faster adoption -- and that actually led to a faster decline in ASP, and we're beginning to see the velocity kind of like pick up to be able to offset that ASP decrease. And that is slightly different than the macro changes that we saw from the macro changes, you said it exactly right where the buying environment is cautious. The environment requires more meetings, more calls and more conversations before we get to the decision. And so I think it's very, very hard to kind of parse these out, but they both had slightly different impacts within the quarter. Kate, for the second part of the question. \nKathryn Bueker: Yes, sure. Alex, Clearbit drove about 1.5 points to revenue growth and billings growth in the first quarter, and we still expect that Clearbit will provide about 1 point of growth for the full year. \nOperator: Our next question today is from the line of Carolyn Valenti of Goldman Sachs. \nGabriela Borges: This is Gabriela. I wanted to ask you, Kate, on how to think about the full year guidance and the impact of macro? So full  year guidance for revenue is the same, it sounds like the macro environment got a little bit worse through the quarter. So is there a company-specific dynamics to the positive [indiscernible]? Or have you always assume a little bit of room for macro degradation as we think about the full year? \nKathryn Bueker: Yes, Gabriela, thanks for the question. We are holding our full year guidance, and there are a few things that are leaving us to do that. The first one that you heard from both Yamini and I in the script as well as in some of Yamini's early comments on this call. Customers are still cautious about their [ cents ], right? Deal cycles are longer, budgets are tighter and our foundational assumption and guidance is that this behavior will continue throughout 2024. \n There's also about $10 million of incremental FX headwinds from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar from this period over when we set guidance last time. And then the combination of the seat pricing model timing and the Q1 macro pressure is causing another $10 million or so of headwind in the quarter-over-quarter expectations. \n That said, there are some great things that we're seeing. Gross retention remains strong in the quarter. There are some marginal improvements in downgrade activity that we're seeing, particularly for seats and contacts. Our guidance philosophy hasn't changed. We want to have a high degree of confidence in the guidance that we share and we think we achieved that in what we put forward today. \nOperator: Our next question today is from the line of Keith Bachman of BMO.. \nKeith Bachman: Yes. I apologize for the background noise at the outset. I wanted to come back to that for a second, and the last question and really focus on seats and pricing. And so you mentioned that, Kate, that the transition was maybe a $10 million headwind quarter-over-quarter. But how does that reflect as you think of the full year? Does the seat-based pricing actually turn into a tailwind because there's greater adoption as we get through the year? But maybe just talk about what happened during the quarter, but how do you see that transitioning as we get to exit run rate for the year? \nYamini Rangan: Keith, this is Yamini. Let me maybe start with explaining what the changes and what we expect, and then Kate can take the second part of how this impacts our guidance for 2024. So just to step back, why did we make this change? We lowered the price of Starter to make it easy for customers to get started with HubSpot. We removed seat minimums to make it easy for customers to upgrade to Pro and Enterprise. But the real benefit of the model. This is why we like it so much is it leads to fewer downgrades and more upgrades over a period of time. \n So in a nutshell, this pricing change allows us to acquire more customers who can start with exactly what they want and can buy more when they need it. And that is good for customers because it leads to healthier customer cohorts, it's really good for HubSpot. Now as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, what surprised us is that we saw a higher percent of customers adopt seats in month 1 compared to what we saw in the pilot. \n So we expected the ASP to go down, volumes to go up and offset each other immediately. But because more customers are adopting the model, we're seeing a sharper decline in ASPs, and it's going to take a couple of months for the volume of customer additions to catch up and offset that ASP decline. So there is a short-term trade-off, but we are very convinced that this is right thing for customers. This is right thing for HubSpot, and therefore, it's a right thing for all of you as investors. \n Having said that, Kate, I'll let you talk about the guidance point. \nKathryn Bueker: Yes. Let me add a couple of specifics to the overall story that Yamini shared. We expected to see customer ASPs fall as part of the seat model change. Because of the pace, it happened quickly in March. And we saw ASPs fall by 20% to 25%. This is very consistent with what we saw in the pilot that we ran in ANZ. \n In the pilot, we also saw an increase in deal velocity that roughly offset the lower ASPs. And so the end result there was that new customer ARR was basically neutral. And because of the sort of sharp pace of adoption, we did not see the velocity in March step-up enough to offset the lower ASP. \n Now April was better but not enough to make up the new customer ARR to be neutral. And April short-cycle deals, which are kind of a leading indicator to what we would see, actually look very similar to the pilot, which is highly encouraging. \n The other piece of good news is that the upgrade rate for customers that are on the new seats model is healthier and very similar to what we saw in the pilot in ANZ. It's about a 6- to 8-point improvement in net revenue retention depending on the addition. So the motion is accretive. It's just going to take a little bit longer than we initially thought for that to play out. And as a result, what we now expect is that the seat model change is going to be neutral to overall ARR for 2024. \nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Rishi Jaluria of RBC. \nRishi Jaluria: I apologize for any background noise. I wanted to dive a little bit deeper into Clearbit. Can you give us a sense for how traction with the product and the integration is going? And maybe how all the data that you're getting from Clearbit can play into your broader AI strategy? \nYamini Rangan: Rishi, thanks a lot for the question. It's early days with Clearbit, but it's going really well. It's been 1.5 quarters since the team got integrated into HubSpot. Now if we take a step back, the vision that we have is really to bring that type of enrich data and powerful AI tools so that can drive insights into our entire customer platform. We think that this is a way for us to accelerate our overall customer platform vision. And we are seeing that play out. \n So Phase 1 of integration was really to bring the Clearbit product into the hands of our installed base customers. And that is going well. It's again early days. But really, the thing that we are excited about is natively bringing the company enrichment data, the instance data and the contact enrichment data natively into HubSpot, so it can power all use cases. \n And this is the way we see the world operating. When you start thinking about a campaign, you already have the information about the companies that look like your customers and then you can apply AI tools on top of that so that your campaigns can be supercharged. So the combination of enrich data, AI, and a unified customer platform is really powerful, and we feel very good about where we are going in terms of that vision. \nOperator: Our next question today is from the line of Elizabeth Porter of Morgan Stanley. \nElizabeth Elliott: I wanted to ask again a question on the pricing change. It was great to see the faster pickup of seats by existing customers, but I wanted to double click on the volume of -- from the new customer side. What were some of the gating factors you think in attracting some of the new logos to the seat model? Is it just about education and the availability of the new model or just any willingness -- less willingness to pick up maybe new solutions? And then any go-to-market changes to kind of address that new customer side? \nKathryn Bueker: Why don't I just start, Elizabeth, with a bit of a clarification. The -- we moved to the seats model pricing for new customers only at the beginning of March. The existing customers will begin being migrated over to the seats model in the back half of 2024. That's going to take some time. As we talked about last quarter, we're going to migrate customers at the same ARR at which they are currently on our platform. And then we will cap any increase on their subscription at 5% when they renew their -- the following time. \nYamini Rangan: And look, I think in terms of your -- is there a resistance or is there something else that we need to be doing. Customers like the model, and they're adopting the model. But if you step back and think about it, it is a big change in terms of the actual go-to-market motion. Our reps need to drive even faster velocity. They need to be able to say which ones are Starter customers with 1 or 2 seats versus Pro customers with more seats. And it takes us a minute to kind of like get that motion settled. \n Having said that, we have driven a ton of enablement of our entire go-to-market motion. We have provided clarity in terms of how this needs to get approached by partners as well as their reps. So I think it's going to take a minute for the model to settle in, but we're seeing the most important thing, which is customer adoption. \nOperator: Our next question today is from the line of Kirk Materne of Evercore ISI. \nS. Kirk Materne: Yamini, in terms of your partners, I mean, there definitely seems to be a lot of interest around AI more broadly. Is there any chance that proof of concepts can move into production and that can help upgrade rates by the end of the year? Or is it a longer-term dynamic? I know it's a bit of a guessing game, but I was just kind of curious about how you see the functionality you're bringing to bear with AI? You're playing out over the course of the year. I realize it's a multiyear journey, but just kind of curious on how that dynamic is going thus far? \nYamini Rangan: Yes, it's a great question. And so maybe 2 parts to the dynamic. One part of your question is like AI usage and adoption. And the other part is proof of concept. I would say the proof of concept is just a function of where we are from a cautious buying cycle perspective. Customers are looking at consolidating on our platform. They want to be very, very sure. And so there's like some additional proof of concepts there. In terms of AI, though, we have -- it's been about a year, right? Last year about this time is when we launched our first set of products. And most of the products are now in GA. In fact, in April, as part of our new Spotlight, we launched about 70 additional AI features. .\n And what we are seeing in terms of adoption is there are customers who are leading with AI. They're looking at like every single department within the go-to-market function saying, how can I leverage AI? And those customers are moving fast. And we can see that in terms of content use case adoption, we can see that in terms of service summarization as well as deflection of call adoption, and we can see that in terms of Sales Hub adoption of AI features. But then there are a whole set of customers who are either just getting out of experimenting or figuring out the first set of use cases and then getting value, and that is going to take time. \n So our focus this year is all about driving repeat usage. From a product perspective, we are focused on driving repeat usage. From a go-to-market perspective, we are focused on educating customers, how their data is being used. Where they can drive productivity benefits as well as growth benefits. And so it's going to take a little while for the AI usage, but we are really happy with the level of innovation as well as leading customer adoption. \nOperator: Our next question today is from the line of Parker Lane of Stifel. \nJ. Lane: Yamini, addressing the top of funnel. You said you saw a lead flow shift away from high-quality INBOUND to partner source leads. With partner source leads to lower quality rep source leads, how would you characterize that lower quality rep source lead? Is that a particular type of customer that's showing up there? Is it those with worse retention characteristics, worse characteristics or a combination of all of that? \nYamini Rangan: Parker, great question. Thank you for asking me this question. Maybe I'll take a minute to explain what I meant. So what we saw in Q1 was a mix shift from INBOUND and partner source leads to more rep source leads. Now INBOUND leads are when customers come in, raise their hands and say that we have a need and we want to kind of move quickly. Partner source leads are and partners have had conversations with our prospects and bring us a qualified lead. These two lead types tend to be more qualified and more ready to purchase. .\n Now in the beginning of the year, we saw a mix shift down from those 2 sources, and we compensated that by rep source leads. Our reps talking to customers, calling customers. \n Now the only difference is that the rep source leads takes more time to progress in the sales pipeline. It's not an immediate interest and ready to purchase customer that's coming into the pipeline. It takes more calls and more demand. So the characteristics is that it takes longer, especially to progress like larger deals. And so we saw that dynamic. But in terms of retention characteristics, it's pretty much the same, right? Once customers are part of HubSpot, they get onboarded and they get activated and we focus on kind of the usage. So hopefully, that explains that mix shift comment I made. Thank you, Parker, for the question. \nOperator: Our next question today is from the line of Brad Sills of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. \nBradley Sills: I wanted to ask a question around the AI road map here. Obviously, a lot of innovation that you've highlighted here that's going into the base product. I think in the past, you've said that you're kind of looking at some of the features that could go into premium-only versions. I'd just be curious if you're finding some use cases that you think are interesting that could do that? And what are your thoughts on just that being a catalyst? I know it's further out, but could that be a catalyst for premium mix and ASP growth? Just any of those dynamics, I think, would be great. \nYamini Rangan: Brad, thanks a lot for that question in terms of like AI and how we're thinking about it. Maybe just to step back, our vision is to embed AI in all Hubs and through our entire platform. And that's exactly what we're doing. We are moving very quickly to build a robust roadmap of AI features and Spring Spotlight that we just launched and announced was full of those kinds of features. \n And if you think about our monetization strategy, it is threefold. When we embed AI across all Hubs and across our entire CRM, it drives adoption. We're seeing more people actually start with the full platform. They get exposed to AI, and we're beginning to see that lift in terms of overall adoption. \n The second thing, and you're absolutely right, we have talked about more features being at The pro and Enterprise tiers. And in fact, we said that nearly 65% of the features that are becoming generally available in the first half of 2024, will be in the Pro and Enterprise tiers. And that's also where we are beginning to see more adoption. \n In the prepared remarks, I talked about 50% of Enterprise customers experimenting and leveraging AI features and 25% of Pro customers are using AI features. And when you look at that, it falls into the bucket of content use cases, service use cases as well as guided selling use cases. \n So all of that shows that we are on the right path. And when we do that, we're going to see kind of the upgrade rates in terms of Pro as well as Enterprise. It's still early days. And so our focus is usage, it's repeat usage and making it super easy for our customers to adopt and innovate with AI. \nDharmesh Shah: Just one quick note. This is Dharmesh. So if you think through last year, 2023 was the year of ChatGPT and chatbot, and we were early to game with our chatbot product. This year is going to be the year of Agent AI, where we have AI software that can move to a higher level of abstraction take on higher order goals. And we -- that's what we're kind of marching towards, and we think that's even higher value functionality that we can add to the platform. \nOperator: Our next question today is from the line of Michael Turrin of Wells Fargo. \nMichael Berg: You got Michael Berg on for Michael Turrin here. I just wanted to ask on AI in the realm of competitive landscape in moving upmarket. It seems like you guys are moving at a very fast clip and kind of differentiated approach to AI. Has this helped any meaningful capacity in the competitive landscape, particularly upmarket? \nYamini Rangan: So let me take that. Thank you for the question. Look, we have a very different approach for AI. And our approach, if you go back to 2014, we said everybody needs to have a great CRM. And if you look at like 2023 last year at INBOUND, we said everybody has to have a great AI-powered CRM. And so our approach has been embed all of the features into Hubs, embed all the features into the platform and make it super easy for our customers to start with AI features and continue to grow with AI features. I think it's a very differentiated strategy, one that leans into our strength of easy to use, fast time to value. And that's very different from a lot of the competitors that are on the path of charging for AI features or getting started with a services engagement. \n And one of the things that we have recognized about AI is this, go-to-market teams are -- they've had the same age old problems over multiple decades. They spend too much time looking at information. They spend too much time collecting and gathering instead of being in front of customers. They spend too much time capturing information that can then be part of handoff. AI creates a new approach to solving age old go-to-market problems. And we want to do it in a way where it is fundamentally easy for our customers to adopt. And so I do think that our approach is differentiated and our approach is going to help our customers adopt it faster. I don't know if Dharmesh, you have more to add there. \nDharmesh Shah: Yes. Just one quick note. So HubSpot, one of our core differentiators for a long time has been our unified customer platform. We have all the data in one place. And this makes it very differentiated from other players in the space where kind of step 1 in order to get value out of AI, you got to first figure out how to get all your data together and make sure everything sort of makes sense.  From the get-go, HubSpot is already together, it's already unified. And so that's what makes it possible for us to kind of embed AI across the entire platform, make it available to hundred thousands of companies and learn from that feedback because we get adoption and usage very, very quickly. So I think we have a very kind of HubSpot-specific take on democratizing AI, making it accessible and then learning really fast based on the usage and leveraging our customer data platform. \nOperator: Our next question today is from the line of Ken Wong of Oppenheimer. \nHoi-Fung Wong: I wanted to dive in on NRR. With strong retention, downgrade stable, I guess, is it fair to assume that the potential pressure that's embedded is just purely a byproduct of upgrade? And then kind of secondarily, any reason to think that there was any hesitation from customers ahead of seat licensing rolling out to the base in the second half that might have maybe kind of caused some pause on upgrade behavior? \nKathryn Bueker: Yes. Why don't I take that one? Net revenue retention in the quarter was 102% for the organic business. And when you add in the impact of Clearbit, it was 101%. A couple of positive trends there. We've consistently seen that customer dollar retention has held for us really strongly in the high 80s, and we saw that again in Q1. .\n The other thing that we've been seeing over the last couple of quarters is a stabilization in downgrades, particularly in seats and contacts. That said,  and I think that we are not the only ones that you've been hearing this from, upgrade rates were particularly challenging in the quarter. Even with some of the early positive signs that we saw in seat expansion with the new pricing model, we did still see significant pressure in upgrade rates. \nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Terry Tillman of Truist. \nRobert Dee: This is Bobby Dee on for Terry. Curious to learn more about the evolution of the customer success or following several promotions announced in early April. What was the thought process on leaving the Chief Customer Officer role unfilled? And could there be opportunities to drive more alignment between customer success, sales and marketing as a result? \nYamini Rangan: Bobby, thank you so much for the question. Yes, we announced that our Chief Customer Officer, Rob, left in early April. And you're absolutely right. We decided that we were going to flatten the organization and have marketing sales and customer success report directly to me. .\n Maybe to step back a few years ago, we needed the Chief Customer Officer role, and we needed that role to bring together marketing, sales, customer success and set a very unified strategy. And you probably remember that 4.5 years ago, I joined -- that was the first time that I took that role. And I'd say that, that strategy setting for the organization and more importantly, bringing marketing sales customer success together has been working really well at HubSpot. \n Now it's the time for speed and execution, and I'm really thrilled that we have a very deep bench of leaders with significant go-to-market as well as HubSpot experience who are stepping up to lead there. And as we mentioned in our press release earlier in April, we have Kip Bodnar, who has been our CMO for a very long time, 9-plus years. And he is a leading voice within AI. He is stepping up and directly into the executive lead. \n And the same thing goes for Christian Kinnear, who's been with us for a very long time, has global perspective, used to lead our international sales and a couple of years ago to on the Chief Sales Officer. He's stepping up in to lead sales. And then Jon Dick, who has been an amazing leader at HubSpot for about 8-plus years in the marketing organization is stepping up to lead our customer success team, and he is deeply passionate about the full customer journey. \n So we're really fortunate to have a deep bench of leaders, and we decided that this is the right time for each of those leaders to step up directly. And we have that full clarity in terms of where we are going in terms of the strategy. So pretty excited and looking forward to each of their contributions. \nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Tyler Radke of Citigroup. \nTyler Radke: Yes. Maybe I'll direct this at Kate. So obviously, just the color on the FX assumptions impacting the full year guide. But despite holding the full year guide constant, you were able to raise operating income guidance. So could you just talk about some of the incremental savings that you saw there? And whether there's any incremental FX impact on that, too? \nKathryn Bueker: Yes, Tyler, thanks for the question. I think you've heard this from me before, but we always try to really strike a balance between growth and profitability, and we continue to show progress against our profitability targets. We remain comfortable that we're going to be in a good position to hit the 18% to 20% target by 2026 and then our longer-term target of 20% to 25% profitability. .\n But coming back to 2024, this is a year where we're going to return to a more normal hiring cadence throughout the year. We expect to end the year at about 10% growth from a headcount perspective. And we are investing disproportionately in R&D. We want to do that to drive innovation and to really plan -- continue to plant the seeds for long-term growth. You saw some of the fruits there in the recent Spring Spotlight. And we're funding this through driving continued leverage in our go-to-market organization, particularly across CS marketing and our partner commission, in addition to just continued optimization of our real estate footprint. And so we expect that we'll be able to deliver more than 1 point of leverage concentrated this year in the back half. \nOperator: Our next question today is from the line of Arjun Bhatia of William Blair. \nChristopher Madison: This is Chris on for Arjun. I wanted to return to some of the commentary you made about demand. It sounds like it's pretty consistent with what we've heard from some of peers in the space. It seems like there was some softening in front office demand during the first quarter that was at least somewhat unexpected. Are there any areas of conservatism or sources of confidence in guidance that you'd like to highlight if these conditions were to continue to worsen? \nKathryn Bueker: Yes. Why don't I just sort of talk about how we approach guidance. As always, we endeavor to put forward guidance that we have a high degree of confidence that we can meet. We have a rigorous forecasting process. We have a rigorous guidance process that we've been using consistently for a very long time. We do a lot of scenario analysis to try to land on the guidance that we feel confident in our ability to achieve. And frankly, that reflects all of the risks and upsides that we see. \nOperator: Our next question today is from the line of Brian Peterson of Raymond James. \nJohnathan McCary: This is Johnathan McCary on for Brian today. So you mentioned the strength in sales and marketing, specifically as front doors this quarter. We heard a little bit last quarter of some of the increased traction in Service Hub as an on-ramp, and I've heard that from partners as well. So just curious if that's still a trend you're seeing for Service Hub you had the conversation in the last 90 days? \nYamini Rangan: Yes, certainly. I think that we -- when we think about front doors, we see 3 front doors, marketing, Sales Hub and then multi-hub. And if you look at the most common combination in multi-hub, it is marketing, sales and service. So we're beginning to see our customers kind of adopt the full platform and start with multiple hubs. \n And specifically, in terms of Service Hub, we made excellent progress this quarter, right? We officially relaunched Service Hub as part of our Spotlight, and it's been extremely well received. Kudos to product team for making excellent progress there. \n And last year was a big year for Service Hub Pro. We did a ton of work to make the Pro tier very powerful. And this year, the focus has been on making all tiers of Service Hub, very competitive and powerful. And if you look specifically at the Spring Spotlight, we launched advanced SLAs, more robust routing and support management tools, and all of these are really aimed at serving our upmarket customers. So that Enterprise tier just got even better. \n And then we also, for the first time launched our customer success workspace. This is for CSM or customer success persona, and we want to provide unified workspace for them to be able to manage their entire book and also be a conduit for connecting the sales teams and the support teams together. So I think that's a huge another area. \n And as always, we've been thinking about how do we like leapfrog Service Hub with AI capabilities, and we certainly see our customers adopt our AI features within Service Hub. So overall, I'm very pleased with the momentum in Service Hub, both from a product perspective as well as from a customer adoption perspective and really happy with the traction we see there. \nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Michael Vidovic of KeyCorp. \nMichael Vidovic: This is Mike on for Jackson Ader. Just quickly on the partnerships and your channel partners. You talked about seeing fewer partner source deals this quarter and having to rely more on direct sales sourcing. But I guess what are you seeing in terms of the different dynamics between, call it, your direct sales motion and your channel sales motion as it relates to the pricing change? \nYamini Rangan: Yes. I think on the pricing change, overall, nothing specific in terms of the change between partner as well as direct sales. Now in terms of what we made as a comment earlier for partner source sales, on the partner side, we've seen great success with our core selling motion. And what that means is partners as well as our direct reps work together, and that co-selling motion is up 65% year-over-year. Now on the flip side, when that co-selling motion is really strong, then partners spend a little bit of time, less time in generating and sourcing their own deals. And so we always want to have the right balance between that co-selling as well as partner sourcing, which is exactly what we are focused on right now. \n So we're rolled out partner enablement. We have rolled out a ton of resources to make sure that our partners and our direct teams work in a way where both the co-selling as well as the partner sourcing is in balance, and we're certainly seeing that in Q2. \nOperator: Thank you. And with no further time for any questions, this will conclude the HubSpot First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Dharmesh Shah",
            "content": "Just one quick note. This is Dharmesh. So if you think through last year, 2023 was the year of ChatGPT and chatbot, and we were early to game with our chatbot product. This year is going to be the year of Agent AI, where we have AI software that can move to a higher level of abstraction take on higher order goals. And we -- that's what we're kind of marching towards, and we think that's even higher value functionality that we can add to the platform. Yes. Just one quick note. So HubSpot, one of our core differentiators for a long time has been our unified customer platform. We have all the data in one place. And this makes it very differentiated from other players in the space where kind of step 1 in order to get value out of AI, you got to first figure out how to get all your data together and make sure everything sort of makes sense.  From the get-go, HubSpot is already together, it's already unified. And so that's what makes it possible for us to kind of embed AI across the entire platform, make it available to hundred thousands of companies and learn from that feedback because we get adoption and usage very, very quickly. So I think we have a very kind of HubSpot-specific take on democratizing AI, making it accessible and then learning really fast based on the usage and leveraging our customer data platform."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Kathryn Bueker",
            "content": "Thanks, Yamini. Let's turn to our first quarter 2024 financial results. Q1 revenue grew 23% year-over-year in both constant currency and on an as-reported basis. Q1 subscription revenue grew 23% year-over-year, while services and other revenue increased 15% on an as-reported basis. Q1 domestic revenue grew 21% year-over-year. International revenue growth was 24% in constant currency and 25% as reported, now representing 47% of total revenue. \n We added over 11,700 net new customers in the quarter, including the onetime addition of nearly 800 customers from the acquisition of Clearbit. This brings our total customer count to over 215,000, growing 22% year-over-year, fueled by our continued strong Starter customer additions. \n Average subscription revenue per customer was $11,400, flat in constant currency and up 1% year-over-year on an as-reported basis. We continue to see a positive impact on ASPs from multi-hub adoption of our professional and enterprise customers, offsetting the impact of large new cohorts of low ASP Starter customers in recent periods. In addition, Clearbit added approximately a 1 point benefit to ASP in Q1. \n As I shared in February, we expect to maintain net customer additions around 10,000 per quarter throughout 2024 with ASRPC down low single digits in constant currency.  \n Gross retention held in the high 80s in Q1, and net revenue retention was 101% or 102% if you remove the impact of Clearbit in the quarter. While we have seen a stabilization in downgrade rates over the last couple of quarters, customer upgrade rates were more challenged in Q1. We expect similar trends to continue in the near term with net revenue retention holding around current levels throughout 2024. Calculated billings were $641 million in Q1, growing 22% year-over-year in constant currency and 20% as reported. The remainder of my comments will refer to non-GAAP measures.\n Q1 operating margin was 15%, up 1 point compared to the year ago period. We continue to see solid progress towards our intermediate operating margin targets across the business. Net income was $89 million in Q1 or $1.68 per fully diluted share. \n Free cash flow was $104 million in Q1 or 17% of revenue. \n Finally, our cash and marketable securities totaled $1.8 billion at the end of March.\n In connection with the quarter close, we discovered an error in our calculation of cost of goods sold related to how we calculate a credit in our hosting agreement with AWS. As a result, we overstated our subscription cost of goods sold by a total of $14 million since Q4 of 2021. Calculating this credit correctly resulted in a $2 million pickup to operating income in each of Q1 2024, in Q1 2023. \n As you update your models, you should assume a positive $6 million contribution to operating income for the remainder of the year, which is included in our guidance. This had no impact on revenue, ARR, operating cash flow and free cash flow in the current or prior periods. \n We have concluded it was not material to prior periods and we'll be correcting the relevant financial statements for comparative purposes in our upcoming 10-Q, which we expect to file on Friday, May 10.\n Before we dive into guidance, I wanted to touch quickly on the macro environment. As Yamini shared, we continue to operate in a challenging external environment and the buyer urgency we saw in December did not carry over into Q1. Customer decision-making is measured and budgets remain tight. Our guidance assumes that these weak conditions persist through 2024.\n Now let's review our guidance for the second quarter and full year of 2024. For the second quarter, total as reported revenue is expected to be in the range of $617 million to $619 million, up 17% year-over-year at the midpoint. We expect foreign exchange to be a 1 point headwind to as-reported revenue growth in the quarter. \n Non-GAAP operating profit is expected to be between $92 million and $93 million. Non-GAAP diluted net income per share is expected to be between $1.62 and $1.64. This assumes 53.3 million fully diluted shares outstanding. \n And for the full year of 2024, total as reported revenue is expected to be in the range of $2.55 billion to $2.56 billion, up 18% year-over-year at the midpoint and consistent with our prior guidance. \n We now expect foreign exchange to be roughly a 1 point headwind to as-reported revenue growth for the full year. \n Non-GAAP operating profit is now expected to be between $426 million and $430 million. Non-GAAP diluted net income per share is now expected to be between $7.30 and $7.38. This assumes 53.5 million fully diluted shares outstanding.\n As you adjust your models, please keep in mind the following. We still expect CapEx as a percentage of revenue to be roughly 4% and free cash flow to be about $365 million for the full year of 2024, with seasonally stronger free cash flow in Q4.\n And with that, I will hand things back over to Yamini for her closing remarks. Yes, sure. Alex, Clearbit drove about 1.5 points to revenue growth and billings growth in the first quarter, and we still expect that Clearbit will provide about 1 point of growth for the full year. Yes, Gabriela, thanks for the question. We are holding our full year guidance, and there are a few things that are leaving us to do that. The first one that you heard from both Yamini and I in the script as well as in some of Yamini's early comments on this call. Customers are still cautious about their [ cents ], right? Deal cycles are longer, budgets are tighter and our foundational assumption and guidance is that this behavior will continue throughout 2024. \n There's also about $10 million of incremental FX headwinds from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar from this period over when we set guidance last time. And then the combination of the seat pricing model timing and the Q1 macro pressure is causing another $10 million or so of headwind in the quarter-over-quarter expectations. \n That said, there are some great things that we're seeing. Gross retention remains strong in the quarter. There are some marginal improvements in downgrade activity that we're seeing, particularly for seats and contacts. Our guidance philosophy hasn't changed. We want to have a high degree of confidence in the guidance that we share and we think we achieved that in what we put forward today. Yes. Let me add a couple of specifics to the overall story that Yamini shared. We expected to see customer ASPs fall as part of the seat model change. Because of the pace, it happened quickly in March. And we saw ASPs fall by 20% to 25%. This is very consistent with what we saw in the pilot that we ran in ANZ. \n In the pilot, we also saw an increase in deal velocity that roughly offset the lower ASPs. And so the end result there was that new customer ARR was basically neutral. And because of the sort of sharp pace of adoption, we did not see the velocity in March step-up enough to offset the lower ASP. \n Now April was better but not enough to make up the new customer ARR to be neutral. And April short-cycle deals, which are kind of a leading indicator to what we would see, actually look very similar to the pilot, which is highly encouraging. \n The other piece of good news is that the upgrade rate for customers that are on the new seats model is healthier and very similar to what we saw in the pilot in ANZ. It's about a 6- to 8-point improvement in net revenue retention depending on the addition. So the motion is accretive. It's just going to take a little bit longer than we initially thought for that to play out. And as a result, what we now expect is that the seat model change is going to be neutral to overall ARR for 2024. Why don't I just start, Elizabeth, with a bit of a clarification. The -- we moved to the seats model pricing for new customers only at the beginning of March. The existing customers will begin being migrated over to the seats model in the back half of 2024. That's going to take some time. As we talked about last quarter, we're going to migrate customers at the same ARR at which they are currently on our platform. And then we will cap any increase on their subscription at 5% when they renew their -- the following time. Yes. Why don't I take that one? Net revenue retention in the quarter was 102% for the organic business. And when you add in the impact of Clearbit, it was 101%. A couple of positive trends there. We've consistently seen that customer dollar retention has held for us really strongly in the high 80s, and we saw that again in Q1. .\n The other thing that we've been seeing over the last couple of quarters is a stabilization in downgrades, particularly in seats and contacts. That said,  and I think that we are not the only ones that you've been hearing this from, upgrade rates were particularly challenging in the quarter. Even with some of the early positive signs that we saw in seat expansion with the new pricing model, we did still see significant pressure in upgrade rates. Yes, Tyler, thanks for the question. I think you've heard this from me before, but we always try to really strike a balance between growth and profitability, and we continue to show progress against our profitability targets. We remain comfortable that we're going to be in a good position to hit the 18% to 20% target by 2026 and then our longer-term target of 20% to 25% profitability. .\n But coming back to 2024, this is a year where we're going to return to a more normal hiring cadence throughout the year. We expect to end the year at about 10% growth from a headcount perspective. And we are investing disproportionately in R&D. We want to do that to drive innovation and to really plan -- continue to plant the seeds for long-term growth. You saw some of the fruits there in the recent Spring Spotlight. And we're funding this through driving continued leverage in our go-to-market organization, particularly across CS marketing and our partner commission, in addition to just continued optimization of our real estate footprint. And so we expect that we'll be able to deliver more than 1 point of leverage concentrated this year in the back half. Yes. Why don't I just sort of talk about how we approach guidance. As always, we endeavor to put forward guidance that we have a high degree of confidence that we can meet. We have a rigorous forecasting process. We have a rigorous guidance process that we've been using consistently for a very long time. We do a lot of scenario analysis to try to land on the guidance that we feel confident in our ability to achieve. And frankly, that reflects all of the risks and upsides that we see."

            "name": "Yamini Rangan",
            "content": "Thank you, Ryan, and welcome to everyone joining us on the call. I'll begin by sharing our Q1 2024 results, update you on what we are seeing from a demand perspective and wrap up by highlighting our recent product launches from the Spring Spotlight and our ongoing efforts to accelerate innovation for our customers.  \n We kicked off the year with solid revenue growth of 23% year-over-year in constant currency. We delivered another good quarter of operating margin growth with 120 basis points of margin expansion year-over-year, driving our operating margin to 15%. Total customers grew by 22% year-over-year to over 215,000 customers globally, driven by over 11,700 net customer additions in the quarter. I am thrilled to see more customers consolidating on HubSpot as their preferred customer platform for growth.  \n Our Q1 results highlight consistency in why we win.  Customers across all segments are consolidating on HubSpot because it is easy to use, easy to scale and delivers fast time to value. In the lower end of our segment, we saw continued strength in net customer additions driven by free users upgrading to Starter and pricing optimization plays, including our seats model change, driving Starter and pro customer growth.  \n In upmarket, the big themes of the quarter were continued strength in Sales Hub and multi-hub as customers consolidate on HubSpot as their platform of choice. Sales Hub is emerging as a clear winner driven by the innovative features we launched at INBOUND. Our customers are adopting the new prospecting workspace and advanced sequences as a way to drive better alignment between marketing and sales. \n In addition, we have opened up our Smart CRM to support UI customization, deliver broader governance and permission capability and deeper integrations like the sync with LinkedIn Sales Navigator, which is driving up-market momentum.  \n Our land and expand strategy is working, and we have 3 main front doors for customers. Marketing Hub, our original hub, where we continue to innovate. Sales Hub, where we see huge momentum. And multi-hub as customers consolidate on HubSpot. Over 35% of Pro+ customers are now on 3 or more hubs, and we have more room for growth as we drive innovation. We're thrilled to see the continued momentum in Sales Hub and multi-hub and it's a clear validation that our strategy of going from app to suite to customer platform is working.\n Switching gears to macro. After a strong finish in Q4, we saw a return to weaker demand conditions in the first quarter, similar to what we experienced in 2023. The buyer urgency that we saw in December did not carry over into Q1. Instead, we saw a return to higher scrutiny of budgets, more decision-makers getting involved and a need for more demos and proof-of-concepts before signing on purchase decisions. At the top of the funnel, we saw lead flows shift away from higher quality inbound and partner-sourced leads to lower quality rep source leads. This shift plus the lower buyer urgency slowed down deal progression and, in some cases, push deals out of Q1 and into Q2. While deal close and upgrade rates remain under pressure, we continue to see strong customer dollar retention in the high 80s, which underscores the value that our unified customer platform delivers for our customers.\n Now for an update on seats. In early March, we introduced a pricing change based on seats to lower the price points to get started with HubSpot and remove the pricing friction for customers to upgrade from Starter to Professional edition. While we continue to be very excited about the model change for our customers on HubSpot, the timing and speed of the change caused a negative impact on our business in March that will likely persist for a couple of months. As a reminder, we expected this change to lead to lower initial ASP, higher volume of customers and higher rates of upgrades over time.  \n In March, we saw faster adoption of the seats model by customers, which led to a more immediate impact of lower ASPs, but a slower pickup in the volume of new customers. We're seeing more positive trends in April, but it's going to take a few months for the higher volume of additions to offset the initial lower price. \n Having said that, I want to be clear that we have high conviction that seats pricing change is the right decision for our customers as it will allow them to get started and scale more easily with HubSpot. And it is the right decision for HubSpot as it will allow us to bring many more customers onto our platform, grow our net revenue retention rate as customers add more seats over time and align pricing with the value we are creating from our AI-powered Smart CRM. \n Okay. Let's talk about product innovation, which has been a consistent theme over the past few years and gives me high confidence in our ability to drive durable growth. The pace of innovation has accelerated in our industry with AI, and we are setting that pace for scaling companies. Innovation is happening in days and weeks, not months or years. Marketing, sales and service teams are going through a major technology shift. But keeping up with that innovation can be a full-time job in and of itself. \n So to make it easy for our customers to stay ahead, we've decided to have not 1 but 2 big launches each year, INBOUND and Spring Spotlight. You all have seen INBOUND and our customers love the innovation that comes out each year. In April, we launched our first Spring Spotlight that featured over 100 new product releases with over 70 AI features. And we saw over 200 million earned media impressions and nearly double the engagement rate on social channels compared to INBOUND 2023. Super exciting.\n I want to highlight 3 big areas of innovation from our Spring Spotlight for you: Content Hub, Service Hub and HubSpot AI. HubSpot give marketeers a better way to grow with INBOUND marketing, and we are now doing it again by reinventing content marketing. We're taking CMS Hub, which used to be about website and digital presence and transforming it into Content Hub, powered by AI to create and manage content across the entire customer journey. \n As part of Content Hub, we launched AI content creation to make it easy to create multilingual content. Content remix to make it easy to create full pipeline of content based on a single asset.  And brand voice to make it easy to generate content that has consistent brand voice. \n Our goal is simple. We want AI to power every content use case and light the way into the future of content marketing.\n Let's talk about Service Hub. I'm really excited about the innovation here. We believe that delighting current customers is even more important than acquiring new customers. So we're relaunching Service Hub to bring customers support and customer success teams together. To help scale customer support, Service Hub now includes advanced SLAs, more robust routing and support management tools. \n To help customer success teams drive retention, we launched a new customer success workspace that can help CSM handle their task, track their pipeline and see customer health scores with clear next steps. \n Service Hub now includes more than a dozen AI-powered tools like GPT-powered chatbot, real-time recommendations and call summaries to speed up resolution. We're embedding AI to make Service Hub even more valuable and delivering a unified customer platform. As one of our customers [indiscernible] said, \"By bringing marketing sales and service teams together on HubSpot, we're removing the guesswork for our leaders and giving them the confidence that customers are getting what they need.\"\n As we set the pace of innovation with AI embedded across all hubs and our customer platform, we are keenly focused on driving adoption and usage. Adoption has continued to increase with over 50% of enterprise portal using AI features along with over 25% of Pro portals. \n Customers are leveraging AI for personalized content generation, call summarization and are automating their go-to-market motions to drive productivity and growth. There is a lot more room to drive repeat usage, and we are laser-focused on helping our customers grow with HubSpot AI.\n Overall, we're still in the early innings of transforming from a suite to a customer platform. We're becoming the de facto standard for scaling companies, and we are setting the pace of innovation with AI. This gives me confidence in our ability to drive long-term durable growth. \n With that, I'll hand it over to our CFO, Kate Bueker, to take you through our financial and operating results. Thank you so much, Kate. I want to close by sharing what keeps us grounded and excited about the future. We crown ourselves on not what is changing today but what will not change for our customers. Our customers will need easy-to-use solutions that can help them grow. Our customers will need us to drive innovation so that they can compete with bigger companies in the age of AI. This is exactly what we are focused on. \n Our customer platform is gaining momentum with more front doors like Sales Hub and multi-hub, and they remain focused on a massive opportunity to help millions of organizations grow.\n Okay. I want to thank our customers, partners and investors for their continued support. And a huge thank you to all HubSpotters around the world for staying focused on solving for our customers every single day. \n With that, operator, let's please open up the call for questions. Samad, thank you so much for the question. Look, I think we're still operating in a very cautious buying environment. And we continue to see that caution across all of the segments within our customer base. Having said that, within the environment, customers are consolidating on fewer platforms, and we are the platform of choice for customers within this environment. That's why we have continuously leaned in on lower total cost of ownership, higher value, faster time to value, and that's been our playbook throughout kind of the soft period from a macro perspective. \n Now you asked kind of what we see in the 500 to 2,000 segment versus the lower environment, we're seeing kind of cautious strength in both, right? In the lower environment, we are removing friction. We are lowering the price and we are increasing the value. And if you look at the entire customer platform that we deliver for a Starter suite customer, it is an exceptionally compelling value proposition, which is why we continue to see the net adds gain strength there. \n And more importantly, what we really look for is when people buy HubSpot, they stay with HubSpot, which we see in that high 80s customer dollar retention. \n In terms of upper end of the segment, it is time to value. The number of conversations that I have with upmarket customers where they care about getting up and running and getting their teams using a customer platform in a few weeks instead of waiting for 8 months, 10 months, which is what happens with other legacy platforms, that is the reason we win. And we are doubling down in product innovation, but also doubling down in delivering the fast time to value. \n So it continues to be a hot environment, but we think it's -- in terms of durable growth,  we are doing all of the right things in terms of going from app to suite to a platform. We're focused across all of the segments, and we are continuously focused on innovation with AI and embedding it into the platform. Mark, this is Yamini. Thank you for the question. Let me share kind of what we saw and maybe provide some contrast across the different periods that you mentioned. We saw choppiness in the environment in Q1. And very specifically, we saw tight budgets, more decision-makers, more meetings, more demos. And even for the first time, more proof of concepts before customers got ready to make purchase decisions. \n And as I mentioned before, this was different than what we saw in December, even accounting for the seasonality differences between Q4 and Q1, December felt more like an anomaly and it felt like in Q1 we are back to a very cautious buying environment. Now it certainly could be what you mentioned, which is just caution in terms of interest rates in the environment. So it felt more like what we saw throughout 2023, and December felt like an anomaly. \n So look, we know that month-to-month, quarter-to-quarter, the environment might look different, that's why we have consistently leaned on the same playbook, which is, in our case, the playbook is communicating business value, communicating the value of consolidating and lowering the TCO and driving a product road map, which is built in with innovation, so we continue to deliver the needs for the customers across these segments. Yes. I'll take that first question, Alex, in terms of parsing macro and pricing. So we talked about the seats change. We launched the seats change in March. And what we specifically saw was a faster adoption by customers of the seats driving model. And compared to what we saw in ANZ and compared to what we saw in our pilot, we saw faster adoption -- and that actually led to a faster decline in ASP, and we're beginning to see the velocity kind of like pick up to be able to offset that ASP decrease. And that is slightly different than the macro changes that we saw from the macro changes, you said it exactly right where the buying environment is cautious. The environment requires more meetings, more calls and more conversations before we get to the decision. And so I think it's very, very hard to kind of parse these out, but they both had slightly different impacts within the quarter. Kate, for the second part of the question. Keith, this is Yamini. Let me maybe start with explaining what the changes and what we expect, and then Kate can take the second part of how this impacts our guidance for 2024. So just to step back, why did we make this change? We lowered the price of Starter to make it easy for customers to get started with HubSpot. We removed seat minimums to make it easy for customers to upgrade to Pro and Enterprise. But the real benefit of the model. This is why we like it so much is it leads to fewer downgrades and more upgrades over a period of time. \n So in a nutshell, this pricing change allows us to acquire more customers who can start with exactly what they want and can buy more when they need it. And that is good for customers because it leads to healthier customer cohorts, it's really good for HubSpot. Now as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, what surprised us is that we saw a higher percent of customers adopt seats in month 1 compared to what we saw in the pilot. \n So we expected the ASP to go down, volumes to go up and offset each other immediately. But because more customers are adopting the model, we're seeing a sharper decline in ASPs, and it's going to take a couple of months for the volume of customer additions to catch up and offset that ASP decline. So there is a short-term trade-off, but we are very convinced that this is right thing for customers. This is right thing for HubSpot, and therefore, it's a right thing for all of you as investors. \n Having said that, Kate, I'll let you talk about the guidance point. Rishi, thanks a lot for the question. It's early days with Clearbit, but it's going really well. It's been 1.5 quarters since the team got integrated into HubSpot. Now if we take a step back, the vision that we have is really to bring that type of enrich data and powerful AI tools so that can drive insights into our entire customer platform. We think that this is a way for us to accelerate our overall customer platform vision. And we are seeing that play out. \n So Phase 1 of integration was really to bring the Clearbit product into the hands of our installed base customers. And that is going well. It's again early days. But really, the thing that we are excited about is natively bringing the company enrichment data, the instance data and the contact enrichment data natively into HubSpot, so it can power all use cases. \n And this is the way we see the world operating. When you start thinking about a campaign, you already have the information about the companies that look like your customers and then you can apply AI tools on top of that so that your campaigns can be supercharged. So the combination of enrich data, AI, and a unified customer platform is really powerful, and we feel very good about where we are going in terms of that vision. And look, I think in terms of your -- is there a resistance or is there something else that we need to be doing. Customers like the model, and they're adopting the model. But if you step back and think about it, it is a big change in terms of the actual go-to-market motion. Our reps need to drive even faster velocity. They need to be able to say which ones are Starter customers with 1 or 2 seats versus Pro customers with more seats. And it takes us a minute to kind of like get that motion settled. \n Having said that, we have driven a ton of enablement of our entire go-to-market motion. We have provided clarity in terms of how this needs to get approached by partners as well as their reps. So I think it's going to take a minute for the model to settle in, but we're seeing the most important thing, which is customer adoption. Yes, it's a great question. And so maybe 2 parts to the dynamic. One part of your question is like AI usage and adoption. And the other part is proof of concept. I would say the proof of concept is just a function of where we are from a cautious buying cycle perspective. Customers are looking at consolidating on our platform. They want to be very, very sure. And so there's like some additional proof of concepts there. In terms of AI, though, we have -- it's been about a year, right? Last year about this time is when we launched our first set of products. And most of the products are now in GA. In fact, in April, as part of our new Spotlight, we launched about 70 additional AI features. .\n And what we are seeing in terms of adoption is there are customers who are leading with AI. They're looking at like every single department within the go-to-market function saying, how can I leverage AI? And those customers are moving fast. And we can see that in terms of content use case adoption, we can see that in terms of service summarization as well as deflection of call adoption, and we can see that in terms of Sales Hub adoption of AI features. But then there are a whole set of customers who are either just getting out of experimenting or figuring out the first set of use cases and then getting value, and that is going to take time. \n So our focus this year is all about driving repeat usage. From a product perspective, we are focused on driving repeat usage. From a go-to-market perspective, we are focused on educating customers, how their data is being used. Where they can drive productivity benefits as well as growth benefits. And so it's going to take a little while for the AI usage, but we are really happy with the level of innovation as well as leading customer adoption. Parker, great question. Thank you for asking me this question. Maybe I'll take a minute to explain what I meant. So what we saw in Q1 was a mix shift from INBOUND and partner source leads to more rep source leads. Now INBOUND leads are when customers come in, raise their hands and say that we have a need and we want to kind of move quickly. Partner source leads are and partners have had conversations with our prospects and bring us a qualified lead. These two lead types tend to be more qualified and more ready to purchase. .\n Now in the beginning of the year, we saw a mix shift down from those 2 sources, and we compensated that by rep source leads. Our reps talking to customers, calling customers. \n Now the only difference is that the rep source leads takes more time to progress in the sales pipeline. It's not an immediate interest and ready to purchase customer that's coming into the pipeline. It takes more calls and more demand. So the characteristics is that it takes longer, especially to progress like larger deals. And so we saw that dynamic. But in terms of retention characteristics, it's pretty much the same, right? Once customers are part of HubSpot, they get onboarded and they get activated and we focus on kind of the usage. So hopefully, that explains that mix shift comment I made. Thank you, Parker, for the question. Brad, thanks a lot for that question in terms of like AI and how we're thinking about it. Maybe just to step back, our vision is to embed AI in all Hubs and through our entire platform. And that's exactly what we're doing. We are moving very quickly to build a robust roadmap of AI features and Spring Spotlight that we just launched and announced was full of those kinds of features. \n And if you think about our monetization strategy, it is threefold. When we embed AI across all Hubs and across our entire CRM, it drives adoption. We're seeing more people actually start with the full platform. They get exposed to AI, and we're beginning to see that lift in terms of overall adoption. \n The second thing, and you're absolutely right, we have talked about more features being at The pro and Enterprise tiers. And in fact, we said that nearly 65% of the features that are becoming generally available in the first half of 2024, will be in the Pro and Enterprise tiers. And that's also where we are beginning to see more adoption. \n In the prepared remarks, I talked about 50% of Enterprise customers experimenting and leveraging AI features and 25% of Pro customers are using AI features. And when you look at that, it falls into the bucket of content use cases, service use cases as well as guided selling use cases. \n So all of that shows that we are on the right path. And when we do that, we're going to see kind of the upgrade rates in terms of Pro as well as Enterprise. It's still early days. And so our focus is usage, it's repeat usage and making it super easy for our customers to adopt and innovate with AI. So let me take that. Thank you for the question. Look, we have a very different approach for AI. And our approach, if you go back to 2014, we said everybody needs to have a great CRM. And if you look at like 2023 last year at INBOUND, we said everybody has to have a great AI-powered CRM. And so our approach has been embed all of the features into Hubs, embed all the features into the platform and make it super easy for our customers to start with AI features and continue to grow with AI features. I think it's a very differentiated strategy, one that leans into our strength of easy to use, fast time to value. And that's very different from a lot of the competitors that are on the path of charging for AI features or getting started with a services engagement. \n And one of the things that we have recognized about AI is this, go-to-market teams are -- they've had the same age old problems over multiple decades. They spend too much time looking at information. They spend too much time collecting and gathering instead of being in front of customers. They spend too much time capturing information that can then be part of handoff. AI creates a new approach to solving age old go-to-market problems. And we want to do it in a way where it is fundamentally easy for our customers to adopt. And so I do think that our approach is differentiated and our approach is going to help our customers adopt it faster. I don't know if Dharmesh, you have more to add there. Bobby, thank you so much for the question. Yes, we announced that our Chief Customer Officer, Rob, left in early April. And you're absolutely right. We decided that we were going to flatten the organization and have marketing sales and customer success report directly to me. .\n Maybe to step back a few years ago, we needed the Chief Customer Officer role, and we needed that role to bring together marketing, sales, customer success and set a very unified strategy. And you probably remember that 4.5 years ago, I joined -- that was the first time that I took that role. And I'd say that, that strategy setting for the organization and more importantly, bringing marketing sales customer success together has been working really well at HubSpot. \n Now it's the time for speed and execution, and I'm really thrilled that we have a very deep bench of leaders with significant go-to-market as well as HubSpot experience who are stepping up to lead there. And as we mentioned in our press release earlier in April, we have Kip Bodnar, who has been our CMO for a very long time, 9-plus years. And he is a leading voice within AI. He is stepping up and directly into the executive lead. \n And the same thing goes for Christian Kinnear, who's been with us for a very long time, has global perspective, used to lead our international sales and a couple of years ago to on the Chief Sales Officer. He's stepping up in to lead sales. And then Jon Dick, who has been an amazing leader at HubSpot for about 8-plus years in the marketing organization is stepping up to lead our customer success team, and he is deeply passionate about the full customer journey. \n So we're really fortunate to have a deep bench of leaders, and we decided that this is the right time for each of those leaders to step up directly. And we have that full clarity in terms of where we are going in terms of the strategy. So pretty excited and looking forward to each of their contributions. Yes, certainly. I think that we -- when we think about front doors, we see 3 front doors, marketing, Sales Hub and then multi-hub. And if you look at the most common combination in multi-hub, it is marketing, sales and service. So we're beginning to see our customers kind of adopt the full platform and start with multiple hubs. \n And specifically, in terms of Service Hub, we made excellent progress this quarter, right? We officially relaunched Service Hub as part of our Spotlight, and it's been extremely well received. Kudos to product team for making excellent progress there. \n And last year was a big year for Service Hub Pro. We did a ton of work to make the Pro tier very powerful. And this year, the focus has been on making all tiers of Service Hub, very competitive and powerful. And if you look specifically at the Spring Spotlight, we launched advanced SLAs, more robust routing and support management tools, and all of these are really aimed at serving our upmarket customers. So that Enterprise tier just got even better. \n And then we also, for the first time launched our customer success workspace. This is for CSM or customer success persona, and we want to provide unified workspace for them to be able to manage their entire book and also be a conduit for connecting the sales teams and the support teams together. So I think that's a huge another area. \n And as always, we've been thinking about how do we like leapfrog Service Hub with AI capabilities, and we certainly see our customers adopt our AI features within Service Hub. So overall, I'm very pleased with the momentum in Service Hub, both from a product perspective as well as from a customer adoption perspective and really happy with the traction we see there. Yes. I think on the pricing change, overall, nothing specific in terms of the change between partner as well as direct sales. Now in terms of what we made as a comment earlier for partner source sales, on the partner side, we've seen great success with our core selling motion. And what that means is partners as well as our direct reps work together, and that co-selling motion is up 65% year-over-year. Now on the flip side, when that co-selling motion is really strong, then partners spend a little bit of time, less time in generating and sourcing their own deals. And so we always want to have the right balance between that co-selling as well as partner sourcing, which is exactly what we are focused on right now. \n So we're rolled out partner enablement. We have rolled out a ton of resources to make sure that our partners and our direct teams work in a way where both the co-selling as well as the partner sourcing is in balance, and we're certainly seeing that in Q2."
