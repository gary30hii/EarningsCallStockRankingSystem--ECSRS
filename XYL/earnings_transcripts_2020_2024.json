As you'll see from our release this morning, the team delivered a strong performance in the fourth quarter, giving us good momentum entering 2021. Every segment and every end market made considerable gains on a quarter sequential basis. And for Xylem overall, the team outperformed expectations across the major metrics, those being revenue, earnings, and cash. As the year came to a close, we took full advantage of stabilizing markets. Both Water Infrastructure and Applied Water Systems showed quicker resilience than anticipated, and we also affirmed our growth trajectory in Measurement & Control Solutions. Building on the large project wins we talked about last quarter by adding at headline AMI deal in Houston, Texas. We also gathered pace with our industry-leading digital portfolio, as the pandemic accelerated customer adoption of digital transformation. The revenue in orders trends both improved significantly. One caveat is that orders were still down slightly due to the scope reduction in a previous large win in India. Otherwise, orders grew in all three of our segments. Xylem's large installed base of core products and established markets provided exceptional resilience on underlying demand for essential services. At the same time, our global presence allowed us to capture the benefits of early recovery in places like China, which grew 18% in the quarter, and also in Europe where we grew 6%. As a result of that positioning on a large and resilient installed base combined with a vibrant growth platform, we enter 2021 with healthy backlogs. They are up 16% overall and up 30% shippable in 2022 and beyond. We know growth rarely happens in a straight line. And clearly the global challenges of 2020 put a hedge on year-on-year numbers including margin, but I am very pleased with how we respond to given these conditions. We took quick action on spending and on structural cost and we also made significant productivity improvements. As a result, we returned to progress on margins in the third and fourth quarters, although we didn't entirely offset COVID effects. Our supply chain execution in-store we cut customer served pandemic and we help them to deliver the central services their communities depend upon. Our operational discipline delivered favorable bottom line outcomes even in unfavorable market conditions strengthening our financial position through the year. The team corrected for the volatile conditions so quickly that in fact we delivered free cash flow conversion north of 180%. Looking ahead, we are encouraged by early signs of market recovery. The ramp up of vaccinations offers hope for an eventual return to normalcy. But we're not there yet. We are still in uncertain times, but we have nevertheless in our 2021 in a very strong position, and we are on course to capitalize on our increased competitiveness, financial strength, and commercial momentum. With that, I'll now want to hand it over to Sandy for more detail on how our segments performed.\nSandy Rowland: Thanks Patrick. We have continued to see steady quarter sequential growth improvement across our businesses since the low point in April. And this quarter, we took another meaningful step forward. Fourth quarter revenue growth was down 2% organically versus the same period last year. That performance exceeded our expectations with upside in all of our end markets and geographically strong growth in China and Europe. I will touch on revenue performance in more detail covering each of the segments, but in short, utilities and industrial were both down 3%, commercial was flat and residential was up 15%. We also saw a quarter sequential improvement in orders. Organic orders were down 1% in the quarter as we delivered a second consecutive quarter of sequential orders improvement. This result most notably reflects the return to growth in M&CS orders, which delivered double-digit gains, including the large win in Houston, which Patrick mentioned. Applied Water contributed solid mid-single-digit growth and Water Infrastructure orders grew mid-single digits excluding the scope production of a project in India. We're still negotiating with the customer, but felt it was most prudent to reflect the scope production now. Otherwise orders growth would have been high single digits for Xylem overall. With orders accelerating and several large contract wins contributing to double-digit growth in backlog, we have good visibility of future revenue streams heading into 2021. I'm very pleased with the team's operational execution and cost discipline. Fourth quarter operating margin and EBITDA margin of 13.8% and 18.8% respectively are above our forecasted range. Compared to the prior year, lower volumes and unfavorable mix were partly offset by strong productivity and cost discipline. I'll review operating margin performance by segment in a moment. Our EPS in the quarter was $0.81 due to higher than forecasted revenue and earnings and from a lower tax rate due to favorable jurisdictional mix. Please turn to Slide 6 and I'll review our segment performance for the quarter. Water Infrastructure orders in the fourth quarter were down 16% organically versus last year. As I mentioned a moment ago that decline was driven by the descoped India project, otherwise orders would have been up mid-single digits reflecting healthy momentum in the segment as a whole, particularly in the wastewater utility businesses. Notably treatment was up 10% as wastewater utility CapEx budgets continue to show resilience globally. Water infrastructure revenue was flat organically in the quarter. Modest growth in wastewater utilities was offset by modest declines in our industrial businesses. Geographically, results were mixed, the U.S. was down high single digits, while Europe and emerging markets were up low-single digits and mid-single digits respectively. These results generally reflect the stage of COVID recovery in each region. Operating margin and EBITDA margin for the segment were down a modest 60 to 70 basis points respectively. Significant savings from productivity and cost reductions were offset by inflation, the recognition of reserves, and negative mix from declines in our U.S. dewatering rental business. Please turn to Page 6. In the Applied Water segment orders were up 4% organically in the quarter, driven by strong demand in Europe and emerging markets, partly offset by modest softness in the U.S. Revenue declined 1% in the quarter, mid-teens growth in residential was offset by softness in industrial, commercial revenue was flat. From a geographic perspective, the U.S. was down mid single-digits as COVID impacts drove declines in the industrial and commercial businesses, offset by that strong residential growth that I just mentioned. Europe delivered high single-digit growth primarily driven by good pace in commercial and modest growth in residential. Emerging markets were down low-single digits. Softness in industrial markets in the Middle East were partially offset by strength in the residential and industrial markets in China. Segment operating margin and EBITDA margin declined 90 and 170 basis points respectively. Volume declines in the industrial end market and overall inflation more than offset solid productivity gains, favorable mix and some price realization in the quarter. Now let's turn to Slide 7 and I'll cover our Measurement & Control Solutions business. In M&CS orders return to growth in the quarter, up 13% organically. This was largely driven by double-digit growth in both water and energy. Orders in our test business were up low single-digits. Revenue improved considerably on a sequential basis from the mid-teen declines we experienced in the second and third quarters. This quarter we finished the quarter, down 5%. While our core U.S. metrology business continued to experience COVID-19 related softness. The largest decline is related to the timing of project deployments. Large scale projects that were in process, pre-pandemic in both the U.S. and the Middle East have been completed. And new projects, which are part of our backlog have been temporarily delayed due to site access restrictions. We expect that large project deployments will resume towards the end of the second quarter and further accelerate in the back half of the year. These declines were partly offset by high single-digit growth in our analytics and advanced digital solutions businesses. Geographically, the U.S. was down mid-single digits for the reasons I just mentioned. Emerging markets was down double-digits due to the timing of prior year project deployments in the Middle East. And Europe grew double-digits from demand in the test business and from the start of the Anglian Water metrology project in the UK. Segment operating income and EBITDA margins in the quarter were down 330 and 350 basis points respectively. Lower volume inflation and favorable mix were partially offset by strong productivity and cost discipline. Now let's turn to Slide 8 for an overview of cash flows and the company's financial position. I was particularly pleased with our strong cash performance for the year. We grew free cash flow by 5% for the full year, exceeding our pre-pandemic free cash flow outlook and delivered free cash flow conversion of 181%. Our team has been focused on driving continuous improvement on working capital for a number of years. In the difficult operating environment of 2020, they took that work another step forward finishing at 17.6% of revenue. This is a 40 basis point improvement year-on-year, excluding foreign exchange impacts and reflects the team's progress in managing inventories and driving solid improvements in accounts receivable collections. We benefited from favorable timing related to the settlement of restructuring tax interest and payroll liabilities, some of which will reverse in 2021. Our balance sheet is well positioned and includes a $1.9 billion cash balance. Net debt to EBITDA leverage is 1.5 times. As a reminder, we'll take advantage of our cash position to repay one of our senior notes amounting to $600 million in the fourth quarter. And lastly, we announced an annual dividend increase of 8%. This is our 10th consecutive annual increase.  Please turn to Page 9 and I'll turn the call back over to Patrick to look forward at 2021.\nPatrick Decker: Thanks, Sandy. 2020 reminded us all that it's prudent to be humble about the fidelity of our foresight. When COVID first began to spread around the world, we said we would focus on managing what we could control. While maintaining our investment for growth and that's exactly what we've done. So with 2021 still presenting some uncertainty, we will apply the same kind of focus that guided us throughout 2020. In our earnings call almost exactly a year ago I said that I expected operational discipline would be a key capability for us. I couldn't have anticipated then how much we do benefit in that capability. When 2020\u2019s big challenges arrived the team delivered on cost, on working capital, on free cash flow and on driving commercial value from our large installed base. We're still in a challenging environment. So we'll continue to face spending until we further see improvement in our markets. We'll keep executing the structural cost program begun in 2020 which is going to deliver savings through 2021. And given some of the inflationary headwinds, we're already seeing we are redoubling our efforts to manage the price cost dynamic. We're keeping a very close eye on our supply chains and proactively managing potential inflationary and logistics impacts. Despite varying by market and geography, there are clearly opportunities for growth in a recovering environment. In digital transformation, the pandemic demonstrated the imperative of operational and financial resilience for utilities which is precisely the value proposition of our advanced digital solutions. Pre-pandemic the business case was already very compelling. But as utility operators work heroically to keep essential services running the stresses of the pandemic made it clear that new approaches are required. Remote monitoring, automated operations and smart infrastructure more broadly, continue to see increased demand. Backlog in our advanced digital solutions grew 70% year-on-year. Although it's from a small base the trajectory is clear. It puts us in a very attractive position as we grow not only in software platforms, but in all of the digitally enabled parts of our portfolio. Geographically, India and China will continue to drive high growth. Despite experiencing COVID earliest impacts China actually grew last year. And in the three years leading up to 2020, India and China post a combined average annual growth rates in the double-digits. With localization strategies well advanced in both countries. Our China and India teams are set to continue delivering impressive growth. It's also worth mentioning a very solid financial foundation underpinning our growth with the current cash balance of nearly $1.9 billion capital deployment is clearly top of mind for us. Even with some debt repayment during the fourth quarter that number still offers a lot of capacity. Alongside organic investment M&A remains a top priority and we intend to be proactive in our deployment of capital wherever the investment case warrants. We remain disciplined about valuations, but we do see opportunity for additional investments over the next 18 months. Growth is also important to our creation of social value. We are in the very privileged position that sustainability is baked into our business model and strategy. Our portfolio of solutions has a net positive impact not only a water, but on a wide range of sustainability outcomes. We took several bold steps on sustainability in 2020 most notably, our Green Bond offering. And performance across these metrics continues to put us in unique leadership position both in the water sector and more broadly. The team's progress has strengthened our position on a number of sustainability indices. We were recently added to Bloomberg Barclays MSCI Green Bond Index. Despite that gratifying recognition, we have so much more work to do to achieve our 2025 sustainability goals and to deliver on our mission. I'm now going to turn it over to Sandy to provide end-market and segment outlook.\nSandy Rowland: Thanks, Patrick. Through 2020 utilities have been reassuringly resilient down only mid single-digits. As you see in the fourth quarter results M&CS and Water Infrastructure revenues held up better than anticipated. Still our outlook for 2021 reflects a tempered view that utilities have not seen the end of the pandemic impacts quite yet. We anticipate our utility business overall, which is just north of 50% of Xylem revenues will grow in the low to mid single-digits in 2021. We expect that same growth rate on the wastewater side as utilities continue to focus on mission-critical applications. And we expect modest recovery and OpEx growth on a global basis through the year. In the U.S. wastewater CapEx is likely to be down modestly. However, the decline should reflect postponements rather than reductions in projects. As you would expect, we\u2019ve kept close to our utility customers to understand how they are thinking about budgets and funding for this year. And while some uncertainty remains the deepest concerns have largely abated since the low point of the pandemic. On the clean water side, we anticipate mid single-digit growth as I mentioned, large project deployments should begin ramping again from the second quarter, accelerating through the end of the year. The large multiyear metrology deals that we won in 2020 set us up for solid growth this year and beyond. In industrial markets, we've seen good sequential improvement. Short cycle orders and project activity are definitely beginning to pick up, but are still likely to be limited by COVID impacts in the near term. We expect industrial to be flattish to up low single-digits. Our commercial end market outlook varies quite a bit by geography. The U.S. will continue to be sluggish. Europe on the other hand, should continue recovering although none at the double-digit pace we saw in the fourth quarter. And overall, we anticipate the commercial market to be flattish to down slightly for the year. On Slide 12, you will see that we are reinstating annual guidance. While uncertainty remains especially regarding the timing and cadence of recovery. We are confident our team will deliver results in line with the following framework. For Xylem overall, we foresee full year 2021 organic revenue growth in the range of 3% to 5%. This breaks down by segment as follows, low to mid single-digit growth in water infrastructure with solid growth in wastewater utilities being partially offset by flattish performance in the industrial markets predominantly in our dewatering business. Low single-digit growth in Applied Water, while we see pockets of recovery in this segment globally, particularly in residential, the outlook for growth in the commercial building end market is more muted. On top of that, our exposure to North America is heavier and the region has lagged on pandemic recovery. In measurement and control solutions, we expect mid-single digit growth. Customers indicate project deployments will likely resume late in the second quarter and further accelerate through the second half of the year. We also expect to see our test assessment services and advanced digital solutions businesses building on the momentum they delivered finishing 2020. While we have typically provided you with both the adjusted operating margin and adjusted EBITDA margins in the past, you will notice that we are increasing our focus and reporting around adjusted EBITDA. We believe that this measure more accurately reflects the cash performance of our businesses and will enable us to more transparently report margin performance after M&A without purchase accounting impacts. For 2021, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be up 40 to 140 basis points to a range of 16.7% to 17.7%. For your convenience, we are also providing the equivalent adjusted operating margin here, which we expect to be in the range of 11.5% to 12.5% up 70 to 170 basis points. This predominantly reflects the benefits from our restructuring savings combined with volume leverage and favorable price mix more than offsetting inflation and investments. This yields an adjusted EPS range of $2.35 to $2.60, an increase of 14% to 26%. Free cash flow conversion is expected to be in the range of 80% to 90% following free cash flow conversion of 181% in 2020 and 124% in 2019. While we continue to drive continuous improvement, we expect to see increases in working capital as we returned to growth and some of the timing benefits we realized in 2020 related to the settlement of liabilities will reverse in 2021. We believe this is purely a dynamic related to 2021 and we expect to drive 100% cash conversion in 2022 and beyond. We have provided you with a number of other full year assumptions on the slide to supplement your models. One key item that I do want to draw your attention to is foreign exchange. We're assuming a euro to dollar conversion rate of 1.22. FX can be volatile and so and FX sensitivity table is included in the appendix, which will help you if we continue to see variations in the rates. Now drilling down on the first quarter, we anticipate that total company organic revenues will grow in the range of 1% to 3%. This includes low single-digit growth in Applied Water and low to mid single-digit growth in water infrastructure. M&CS is expected to decline low to mid single-digits as we anticipate continuing delays from COVID before projects begin deployment in Q2. We expect first quarter adjusted EBITDA margin to be in the range of 14% to 15% representing a 170 to 270 basis points of expansion versus the prior year with the largest expansion coming from M&CS due to operational improvements and a prior year warranty charge. And with that, please turn to Slide 13 and I'll turn the call back over to Patrick for closing comments.\nPatrick Decker: Thanks, Sandy. We recognize both the marketplace is stabilizing and that is still like would be unsettled for some time. But we come into the New Year, with good momentum and an even stronger position emerging from the pandemic then when we entered it. That position is built on a durable business model. We have vital products at the heart of essential services and we have differentiated technology that provides a multiyear runway for attractive growth. Our mission has perhaps never been more relevant and our underlying investment thesis remains robust. Our near-term performance is delivering results and we continue to invest for sustainable growth. That's in line with our long-term strategy to create both economic and social value for our shareholders, our customers and our communities. We'll provide an update on our key strategic priorities and our long-term plans at a virtual Investor and Analyst Day planned for later this year, where I look forward to sharing more detail on our technology and solution capabilities and to discussing our growth strategies. So now operator with that, we'll turn the call over to you for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from the line of Mike Halloran with Baird.\nMike Halloran: Let's start on the M&CS side, margins up a little bit as you work through the year here. I mean, as we get through next year, feels like there's a correlation with how margins are tracking in the deployment curve. So when you take all the cost efforts that you've done and you get towards some normalization as you get these deployments out? Is that point in time, you're thinking about, whether it's 2022 kind of timeframe getting back to that normal range, you've been in historically or are there other factors that will play that can move that around and just kind of latest greatest thoughts on that side?\nSandy Rowland: Yes, Mike thanks for the question. Obviously, as we work through the pandemic, the M&CS segment was our segment that was most impacted. And we saw that with steeper revenue declines which also impacted the margins. The business team took strong action throughout 2020 to make structural cost saving changes that are permanent. And we think that as we move through 2021, that is a segment where you're going to see the largest part of our margin expansion. And Mike, you're going to see that right from the get go out of the gate. When we look at Q1 that's also the segment that's going to have greatest margin expansion. And that comes from operational efficiencies from the restructuring, as well as we did have a one-time item last year.\nPatrick Decker: Yes, Mike, we've got a number of these large deal deployments. I think recently we've won as much as north of $300 million of large deals in 2020. Those are going to begin to ramp as site access returns and we just continue to have some really good commercial wins here. And when I say good meaning they come with very attractive accretive margins in those deals.\nMike Halloran: So basically what I'm hearing though is, as you get those deployments out and you get to a more normalized site access, there is no reason to think that normalized range for M&CS is back on the table, whenever that time period started?\nPatrick Decker: That is correct.\nMike Halloran: Okay.\nSandy Rowland: Mike, the one thing that I would add as we look out through 2021, you're going to see the strongest performance in Q4 from a margin perspective. And at that point in time, we would expect that we will be back at 2021. I'm sorry, we are back at 19 margin levels, and will be on good pace for margin expansion.\nMike Halloran: Great, that's helpful there. And then second one on the capital deployment side, obviously highlighted M&A and focus on that, maybe just talk about the actionability of the supply - of the funnel right now, and if there is really any change to the focus in what you're interested in bringing in relative to what's in that funnel?\nPatrick Decker: Yes. So Mike, no real change and our focus areas in the M&A funnel. I mean we've got a number of kind of smaller bolt-on tuck-ins that we'll be executing this year, but we are staying very close to a couple of larger actionable items as well. So again, we've got a keen eye on valuations and we do understand the value of organic growth, and again we're going to continue to remain disciplined. But we're optimistic.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.\nDeane Dray: Maybe we can start with some of the dynamics within the business. And Patrick just give us some sense of that change in scope on the India pump order, things are changing really fast there. I get it there and basically crisis mode, but just what went on there and what's the outlook because there is still so much to do there in India. So start there and then some color on that Houston project please?\nPatrick Decker: Sure. So I'll let Sandy take the Houston project question, I'll focus here on India. So, we still remain very positive on India, Deane. We've seen double-digit growth the last few years, we've got a great backlog there. Obviously the top policy mandate by Prime Minister, Modi continues to be the case there. This was a unique descoping on one project, where it was a little bit driven by an element of nationalism and so we are still going back and negotiating on that. We don't see that as part of a broader trend, it was very unique, very localized in one particular state, and again we just want to be appropriately conservative to reflect a reduction now in our orders. We'll see how it plays out, but no change in our view at all, Deane on India.\nDeane Dray: Great. And I know - go ahead Sandy on Houston.\nSandy Rowland: Yes. Thanks Deane for the question. This is another project that we're very, very excited about, and it builds on the $250 million of awards that we announced earlier in the year. So this deal is about $40 million deal, it's primarily a water deal, and it's with a really powerful water utility. So it's one that we're quite pleased to bring into our backlog.\nDeane Dray: How much of the digital offerings is embedded in this - the Houston project. I know its meters, but anything else that you would highlight?\nPatrick Decker: Yes, Deane it's an AMI deal, it is new, it is a share gain for us and displacing someone that was there before. And so it will fit in that digital landscape as you think about the communications offering from FlexNet on the Sensus side.\nDeane Dray: Great. Patrick, it looks like you're exiting the year with more momentum on your digital offerings, and this was the expectation that the reaction of the utilities and coal that was, they didn't need to do more remote monitoring, they didn't need to do more automation. And so just, your sense of that demand are we seeing what inning are we so far in this - what I think is a big conversion here on digital?\nPatrick Decker: Yes, I think it's, we're still early innings here, Deane, I would say there are two dynamics at play. One is as you pointed out, the utilities are moving now from these things being nice to have, the must haves especially with remote monitoring, restricted labor deployment capabilities, but secondly, we are in the early innings still in terms of, we put new structure in place for the last year, we put new incentives in place to really drive synergies more broadly. So it's not just about the artist known as Xylem view our digital revenue. It's also the impact that has on pulling through other deals, yes, Houston being a good example of that. We talked about Columbus, Winston-Salem late last year. So we're taking a broader view on this Deane and then just the digital revenue component. It really is the impact it has on our broader portfolio.\nDeane Dray: That's great. And just last one for me is for Sandy, you've had the opportunity to be in the role now for enough time to maybe you can share with us where do you see yourself making the biggest impact, the biggest focus and maybe you can comment on working capital to sales, because it's been improving, but my sense is, there is still lots more you can do there. But I would love to hear your thoughts.\nSandy Rowland: Yes, Deane. Thanks for the questions. I've been here now for four months, and it's been really interesting, I think I'm still very excited about the opportunity for growth particularly by scaling our digital portfolio, and that's a journey that I think we're making good progress on, and very encouraged about the collaboration across the organization that there are digital opportunities that span the full portfolio. Also think your work is never done around continuous improvement and so there certainly is opportunity for us to continue to drive margin expansion, whether it's through conversion cost projects, further optimizing our footprint, there is opportunity there. Turning to your question on working capital, I think that the team did a terrific job on that this year, in years where your revenue growth declines, it's difficult to make improvements on a percentage basis, and the team did a super job on collections, bringing down our past dues, and we need to shout out and recognize our operations team on how they effectively managed and controlled inventory. So as we return to growth next year, working capital will be a little bit of a headwind. We're going to continue to drive continuous improvement initiatives whether it's scaling some of our financing programs with our suppliers and other efforts. But I think we're exiting in a pretty good spot there.\nPatrick Decker: And Deane not to belabor it, but just to remind all of our investors that our three primary annual incentive plan metrics, our organic revenue growth, it's operating margin, operating income, and it's free cash flow conversion of which the single biggest driver there is working capital as a percentage of revenue. And so I just want to make sure we reminded all of our investors that we're not taking our foot off of working capital in any way, shape or form.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Patrick, so I think we can all understand why Xylem is performing so well in China, given the relative strength in that economy. But what's a little more difficult to understand is why you are performing so much better consistently in Western Europe, then you are in the U.S. I mean COVID interruption is in some parts of Europe it's just as bad as here. So what is it about your business that's allowing you to outperform in Europe versus the U.S.\nPatrick Decker: Yes, I think part of this is a timing issue for the U.S. We're in the early stages of recovery there. It also is as Europe traditionally has been more stable in terms of how utilities focus on their spending and how they plan their budgets accordingly. We also benefit from a very strong share position in Europe. And so when that's the case, the level of aftermarket recurring revenue benefits us quite significantly there, but I wouldn't read too much into the - I wouldn't suggest that Europe is going to outpace the U.S. over time. I think really just more a matter of timing right now.\nAndy Kaplowitz: That\u2019s helpful.\nSandy Rowland: I mean, I would add to that is a little bit is mix to. So in Europe, our concentration is heavier on the wastewater side, and that has been especially resilient during the pandemic. And as we move through 2021, we are expecting to see progress on clean water, especially as we can start rolling out those deployments.\nAndy Kaplowitz: That's helpful. And then this is probably for Patrick or Sandy, you talked about $80 million I think of permanent cost savings in 2021. There is $60 million of temporary cost savings that would come back in some way. Maybe you could talk about the buckets of savings that are implied in that 2021 forecast that you now have? What are you assuming for inflation, because if I look at the incremental margin that you're forecasting doesn't look like it's equal to gross margin even. So, there must be a sizable inflation component in there?\nSandy Rowland: Yes, so I think there is multiple elements to that question. Let me try to break it down for you in a couple of different - pieces. So I'll start with restructuring. This year, we did take aggressive restructuring actions and we realized about $70 million of savings from those structural programs. As we look forward into 2021, we're expecting a similar level. We have some further programs in Europe that haven\u2019t been completed yet both related to footprint migration as well as overall efficiencies. But we do certainly expect to get those done in 2021 and that will help us from a year-over-year perspective. Discretionary costs is another bucket that we are focused on and as we look year-over-year we took about $60 million of costs out from discretionary categories like travel and entertainment, services, marketing et cetera. And our 2021 plan contemplates that about 40% of those costs will return. And then I would say that the third part of your question, you're starting to touch on inflation, which is probably the most challenging part of the equation. As you know we saw a very stable inflationary environment for most of 2020, did start to see that pick up at the end of 2020. And we're seeing that pressure continue in 2021. Our teams have gotten a little bit in front of that. So we have announced price actions that have been implemented in the first quarter, but the inflation around materials is something that we are watching very, very closely.\nPatrick Decker: And I would just add that, we are clearly looking at the level of uncertainty here in terms of what inflation is likely to be. And we're trying to be appropriately kind of measured in how we are reflecting that in our guide for the year. This is not unchartered territory for us in terms of the whole price cost dynamic. We've been here before think back to the tariff timeframe. Our price realization we\u2019re expecting that - along with productivity will offset material and labor inflation. We've got a very strong and proven procurement team and they are in lockstep with our commercial teams on making sure that we've got that that highlighted. So, again as Sandy said, we are already using pricing actions. The impact our different across each one of the segments based upon the impact on commodities. But we just thought it would be prudent to guidance we've done.\nAndy Kaplowitz: And Patrick, you had 60 basis points in Q4. I would assume that you get a lot more price then that for 2021 there?\nSandy Rowland: Yes, I think that's a fair assumption.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Scott Davis with Melius Research.\nScott Davis: Good, most of my questions have been asked, but if you look at your CapEx guide, looks like up about 20%. Where is the dollar - where is the money being prioritized maybe just some examples or projects or geographies or areas that you're focused on right now?\nSandy Rowland: Yes, thanks Scott. I think as we move through the pandemic, we certainly clamp down on our spending around CapEx in 2020 and our outlook for CapEx for 2021 is very much in line with our historical spend levels. I think that a lot of our CapEx deployment is tied to our growth strategies and we're making investments on the digital side. We're making investments in emerging markets. We're making some investments in our manufacturing centers to drive continuous in improvement. And so it's something that we're going to watch closely throughout the year and make sure we face that increase accordingly. As we see recovery will start to release incremental CapEx dollars to position us for growth in 2022 and beyond.\nPatrick Decker: Yes, Scott I would say, I would just add to Sandy\u2019s point we're going to continue to manage the phasing on CapEx. We\u2019ll see how the year plays out in terms of market recovery. There is no one or two big bang CapEx projects that are in there. It's pretty well distributed and it very much is tied to growth. So, I would just reinforce what Sandy said it's localization within emerging markets. It's some upgrade in terms of continuous improvement in a few of our factories. But it also is a fair amount, tied to the work that has to be done to support some of the large deal wins that we have within M&CS.\nScott Davis: Okay, that's really helpful. And then I know working capital has been kind of beaten to death, but Sandy since you\u2019re relatively new it's a fresh set of eyes on this stuff. Is there any kind of structural reason why? I always think of working capital being percent of sales kind of 14% or lower being, getting into the territory of the best run companies? Is there any structural reason why that number can be down towards kind of - as I said more best-in-class levels?\nSandy Rowland: I don't think there is any structural reason. I think, we're going to continue to work at this. And I think the company has made steady progress over the years. And it's definitely something that we're not losing focus on we're not satisfied, but we're going to continue to drive that journey.\nPatrick Decker: Our biggest challenge Scott and it is kind of endemic within the water sector is. We still have work to do to simplify our supply chain and that has an impact on inventory levels. So I would say, if you look at our receivable performance. Our payable performance, we're pretty much in line there. There is some opportunity there, but it's not - that's not really going to move the needle. It really is structurally on the inventory side and that's work that Tony Milando and our supply chain team have been very much focused on it made good improvement but there still in my view a fair ways to go.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Nathan Jones with Stifel.\nNathan Jones: A couple questions, follow-up really on the margin side of this. If I look at your guidance, the top end of revenue guidance and the top is about where you were in revenue in 2019, and the top end of the margin guidance is still about 100 basis points below where you were in 2019, $140 million of structural cost taken out of the business during that time, you said price and productivity offset inflation. So can you fill in the blanks there on where the gap is between where margins are expected to be in '21 versus where they were in '19 on roughly the same revenue level?\nSandy Rowland: Yes, I think Nate, you hit on a lot of the points there, and as we've modeled out 2021, we are modeling in good incremental margins through the portfolio. There is still some mix differences as we exit, M&CS has been a little bit delayed from a pandemic recovery perspective, and once we get that back on track and growing, you're going to see margin expansion ramp back up. I think the other thing is, we're continuing to make investments on the digital front, and those are prudent investments and we're phasing them throughout the year in line with the recovery, but I think that's probably the one piece that you may be overlooking in the model.\nPatrick Decker: Yes, Nate, I think the other piece I would say is, it's really important to focus on and we can certainly get more clarity on this second half versus first half what the exit rates are in terms of both top line growth and margin. You're looking at the full-year or average.\nNathan Jones: I'll take that color then maybe you can talk about the differences in growth rates and margins in the first half and second half.\nSandy Rowland: Yes, let me take the first crack at that and then Patrick can chime in. I think as we think about the quarter sequential trends through 2021, yes, you almost have to think about how the pandemic impacted our businesses and regions throughout the year. And so I think right out of the gate in Q1, I think what's important is that we're going to return to growth and you're going to see meaningful margin expansion. From a margin perspective, the biggest growth happens in the first half of the year, because as you saw our margins were much stronger in Q3 and Q4 than they were in the earlier part of the year. And then I think as we focus and drill down on M&CS it's the deployments in the second half that from a dollar value perspective starts to accelerate, and as we exit 2021, again, I think our revenue and margin levels will be very much in line with what we experienced in 2019.\nNathan Jones: Do you think M&CS exit the year at double-digit operating margins?\nSandy Rowland: I would say it's probably more high-single digits.\nPatrick Decker: Again we're talking operating margins.\nNathan Jones: Yes, yes, I think the lot of data in that one. Okay. I'll pass it on.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Saree Boroditsky with Jefferies.\nSaree Boroditsky: Thanks for taking my questions. Just a follow-up on the previous question on margins for 2019 levels. I would have also thought you'd had FX benefit to margin. So you could just quantify how you're thinking about this?\nSandy Rowland: FX is one of our key variables and key assumptions and we've guided to a 1.22 euro to dollar conversion rate. I think the way that I think about FX in particular, is that the euro is the most important currency pair for us, and a 5% variation in the euro drives about $50 million of revenue and about $20 million of margin. So I think that's a good way to frame it.\nSaree Boroditsky: Great, thanks, that's helpful. And then could you provide some color on what you saw in the dewatering business in the quarter and what is driving expectations for an acceleration through the year and should this drive improvement in the margin performance in Water Infrastructure as we go through the year as well?\nPatrick Decker: Yes. We do expect the activity and dewatering to ramp in the second half of 2001. Part of that is we put some more sophisticated pricing models in place that are going to be driving high margin rental, because rental really is a key focus area there for us, it really also is tied to what we're expecting in terms of the North America, industrial and commercial business. We've seen quite encouraging performance in January with opportunities not only in the U.S. but also growing in Western and Southern markets. So we'd expect about flattish to low single-digit growth for '21 to your last point.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James.\nPavel Molchanov: Yes, thanks for taking the question. You referenced the appetite for M&A, but you also said, you're going to be disciplined, and I suppose, as we're getting out of the crisis phase of the pandemic into a recovery, would it not all else being equal, make valuations in water tech even higher than they have been in recent years?\nPatrick Decker: It depends on the sector within the water space. Obviously things that are of a higher digital nature that has more of a recurring revenue kind of SaaS nature of the model across any sector those are always going to have higher multiples and premiums. I think we're proud of the work the team has done in a number of these areas that we look at our relationships that we've built over a number of years. And so a number of these things don't actually go through an auction process. And that's really where I think the seller finds Xylem be an attractive partner because of our global breadth, our channels to market the breadth of our portfolio. And again, we tend to look at some of the smaller M&A to be really a proxy for R&D. And so, again we're going to be disciplined in this regard, but no, I'm still very encouraged by what we see in the pipeline.\nPavel Molchanov: Okay. But let me ask kind of a broader question. We're seeing or hearing lots of talk in Washington about infrastructure. And in Europe, the next generation EU has an infrastructure program as one of its components. Yes, I'm curious kind of - to what extent you expect as a company to benefit as these infrastructure stimulus initiatives begin to actually materialize?\nPatrick Decker: Yes, so I mean we\u2019re generally positive on the early indications from the new administration. Having said that, it's far too early to know anything beyond intentions and policy outlines we're not assuming. We're building into our forecast anything for an infrastructure bill, because we really need to see what ultimately is scoped in. But again discussions and indications on plans thus far do seem to include water as part of that focus, which we find obviously very encouraging. But our utility customers have also made it clear with us that they are not assuming or planning for it. And again they would say, we've seen that movie before with previous new administration that came in. But clearly, if and when we do see something on infrastructure that's going to be a big net positive for us. Given that our portfolio touches nearly all parts of the water cycle.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Joe Giordano with Cowen.\nJoe Giordano: Patrick, you touched on M&A a couple of times. I'm just curious like MC&S is a business for you guys that you're trying to arguably make less complicated. And like how you feel about adding to that business and making it at least near-term more complicated?\nPatrick Decker: Yes, I wouldn't look at it in terms of adding complexity to M&CS. I think - the way we think about it is, just adding to the portfolio of solutions that we can bring to most notably the clean water side of the utilities and so as we are in there and doing concentrated work. We continue to see areas of opportunity where we can bring more digital to the portfolio. So I wouldn't look at it is adding complexity, I take your point. Obviously, any time that we look at smaller start-ups that we add to the portfolio scaling them and getting channel to market. Obviously, is one of the big synergies that we bring, but we do that with great confidence.\nJoe Giordano: And then last from me just on dewatering, can you just talk about what\u2019s going on like underlying in that market. I know like there has been a lot of competition on the construction element, and you guys maybe trying to reposition out of that, maybe a little bit away from that into more like the mining and stuff like that? How is that playing out because I feel like they're - within energy and mining and you had to shutdown quarter with construction activity? So I thought the comps would be pretty good in that business just relative to like the flattish guide there?\nPatrick Decker: Yes, yes I think you're right Joe. I think, we're expecting the business is going to start to come back and be positive for us this year. I think we're a little cautious on calling that. We have also seen that movie play out before. And so that's one that we'd like to see the activity really come back. I think - there is normal seasonality in some of the North America side in terms of weather and doing some of that construction and industrial activity. Part of its lagged a little bit because of COVID to Joe, because think about this as a very much a people-driven business, it's very much hand-to-hand out in construction yards and so forth. And so, as they're not able to get out onsite and do some of that work. Then there has been some noise there. We expect it's going to come back though here in 2021.\nJoe Giordano: Yes.\nSandy Rowland: Yes, there still will be some pressure in Q1 from a COVID perspective, but in the second half of the year, we're expecting that it's more neutral.\nOperator: Our final question is from the line of John Walsh with Credit Suisse.\nJohn Walsh: A lot of ground covered obviously very strong cash performance in 2020. Just had a question about how to think about the absolute free cash flow for next year, you gave the conversion ratio. I think there, is usually some adjustments obviously to net income that you provide in the reconciliation? Is it as simple is doing the math on the adjusted net income or there are some items that we need to think about in terms of add backs when we do the conversion ratio?\nSandy Rowland: Yes, I think that we did give you an outlook on what we expect to spend from our restructuring and realignment perspective and we also provided you with the tax rate. So I think we've given you all the inputs to model. But I think big picture, if you look at 2019 through 2021. We expect free cash flow conversion to be 130% which is very healthy. I think there is - three discrete headwinds for 2021. The first one we talked about earlier on the call is as we return to growth there\u2019ll be some add-back from working capital. We talked about resuming CapEx to be more in line with historical levels. And I think the third one is more unique to 2020 and 2021. And that is there were a number of liability categories that we benefited from the timing on. That benefit was about $75 million in 2020, two-thirds of that will reverse next year, but I think that's largely a one-time phenomenon. And so yes, 80 to 90 is lower than our historical target, but three years being at 130 I think is a good spot.\nJohn Walsh: Great yes, no, that's very helpful color on those moving pieces, that's all I had. Appreciate you taking the question. Thank you.\nPatrick Decker: Thank you, John.\nOperator: I would now like to turn the call back over to Patrick Decker for closing remarks.\nPatrick Decker: Thanks. So again I appreciate. We all appreciate the continued support and interest. Thanks for joining the call today. I want to wish you all a happy and healthy New Year. I know we\u2019re already - it's hard to believe we're already more than a month into it. But again hopefully all your families and friends are safe and sound. Look forward to catching up with you and in our next earnings call. And as we said earlier, we'll be scheduling and planning an Investor and Analyst Day sometime later this year and we'll get back to you all on that. So, thank you all very much and have a great weekend.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude today's Xylem Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year-End 2020 Earnings Conference Call. Please disconnect your line at this time and have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Sandy Rowland",
            "content": "Thanks Patrick. We have continued to see steady quarter sequential growth improvement across our businesses since the low point in April. And this quarter, we took another meaningful step forward. Fourth quarter revenue growth was down 2% organically versus the same period last year. That performance exceeded our expectations with upside in all of our end markets and geographically strong growth in China and Europe. I will touch on revenue performance in more detail covering each of the segments, but in short, utilities and industrial were both down 3%, commercial was flat and residential was up 15%. We also saw a quarter sequential improvement in orders. Organic orders were down 1% in the quarter as we delivered a second consecutive quarter of sequential orders improvement. This result most notably reflects the return to growth in M&CS orders, which delivered double-digit gains, including the large win in Houston, which Patrick mentioned. Applied Water contributed solid mid-single-digit growth and Water Infrastructure orders grew mid-single digits excluding the scope production of a project in India. We're still negotiating with the customer, but felt it was most prudent to reflect the scope production now. Otherwise orders growth would have been high single digits for Xylem overall. With orders accelerating and several large contract wins contributing to double-digit growth in backlog, we have good visibility of future revenue streams heading into 2021. I'm very pleased with the team's operational execution and cost discipline. Fourth quarter operating margin and EBITDA margin of 13.8% and 18.8% respectively are above our forecasted range. Compared to the prior year, lower volumes and unfavorable mix were partly offset by strong productivity and cost discipline. I'll review operating margin performance by segment in a moment. Our EPS in the quarter was $0.81 due to higher than forecasted revenue and earnings and from a lower tax rate due to favorable jurisdictional mix. Please turn to Slide 6 and I'll review our segment performance for the quarter. Water Infrastructure orders in the fourth quarter were down 16% organically versus last year. As I mentioned a moment ago that decline was driven by the descoped India project, otherwise orders would have been up mid-single digits reflecting healthy momentum in the segment as a whole, particularly in the wastewater utility businesses. Notably treatment was up 10% as wastewater utility CapEx budgets continue to show resilience globally. Water infrastructure revenue was flat organically in the quarter. Modest growth in wastewater utilities was offset by modest declines in our industrial businesses. Geographically, results were mixed, the U.S. was down high single digits, while Europe and emerging markets were up low-single digits and mid-single digits respectively. These results generally reflect the stage of COVID recovery in each region. Operating margin and EBITDA margin for the segment were down a modest 60 to 70 basis points respectively. Significant savings from productivity and cost reductions were offset by inflation, the recognition of reserves, and negative mix from declines in our U.S. dewatering rental business. Please turn to Page 6. In the Applied Water segment orders were up 4% organically in the quarter, driven by strong demand in Europe and emerging markets, partly offset by modest softness in the U.S. Revenue declined 1% in the quarter, mid-teens growth in residential was offset by softness in industrial, commercial revenue was flat. From a geographic perspective, the U.S. was down mid single-digits as COVID impacts drove declines in the industrial and commercial businesses, offset by that strong residential growth that I just mentioned. Europe delivered high single-digit growth primarily driven by good pace in commercial and modest growth in residential. Emerging markets were down low-single digits. Softness in industrial markets in the Middle East were partially offset by strength in the residential and industrial markets in China. Segment operating margin and EBITDA margin declined 90 and 170 basis points respectively. Volume declines in the industrial end market and overall inflation more than offset solid productivity gains, favorable mix and some price realization in the quarter. Now let's turn to Slide 7 and I'll cover our Measurement & Control Solutions business. In M&CS orders return to growth in the quarter, up 13% organically. This was largely driven by double-digit growth in both water and energy. Orders in our test business were up low single-digits. Revenue improved considerably on a sequential basis from the mid-teen declines we experienced in the second and third quarters. This quarter we finished the quarter, down 5%. While our core U.S. metrology business continued to experience COVID-19 related softness. The largest decline is related to the timing of project deployments. Large scale projects that were in process, pre-pandemic in both the U.S. and the Middle East have been completed. And new projects, which are part of our backlog have been temporarily delayed due to site access restrictions. We expect that large project deployments will resume towards the end of the second quarter and further accelerate in the back half of the year. These declines were partly offset by high single-digit growth in our analytics and advanced digital solutions businesses. Geographically, the U.S. was down mid-single digits for the reasons I just mentioned. Emerging markets was down double-digits due to the timing of prior year project deployments in the Middle East. And Europe grew double-digits from demand in the test business and from the start of the Anglian Water metrology project in the UK. Segment operating income and EBITDA margins in the quarter were down 330 and 350 basis points respectively. Lower volume inflation and favorable mix were partially offset by strong productivity and cost discipline. Now let's turn to Slide 8 for an overview of cash flows and the company's financial position. I was particularly pleased with our strong cash performance for the year. We grew free cash flow by 5% for the full year, exceeding our pre-pandemic free cash flow outlook and delivered free cash flow conversion of 181%. Our team has been focused on driving continuous improvement on working capital for a number of years. In the difficult operating environment of 2020, they took that work another step forward finishing at 17.6% of revenue. This is a 40 basis point improvement year-on-year, excluding foreign exchange impacts and reflects the team's progress in managing inventories and driving solid improvements in accounts receivable collections. We benefited from favorable timing related to the settlement of restructuring tax interest and payroll liabilities, some of which will reverse in 2021. Our balance sheet is well positioned and includes a $1.9 billion cash balance. Net debt to EBITDA leverage is 1.5 times. As a reminder, we'll take advantage of our cash position to repay one of our senior notes amounting to $600 million in the fourth quarter. And lastly, we announced an annual dividend increase of 8%. This is our 10th consecutive annual increase.  Please turn to Page 9 and I'll turn the call back over to Patrick to look forward at 2021. Thanks, Patrick. Through 2020 utilities have been reassuringly resilient down only mid single-digits. As you see in the fourth quarter results M&CS and Water Infrastructure revenues held up better than anticipated. Still our outlook for 2021 reflects a tempered view that utilities have not seen the end of the pandemic impacts quite yet. We anticipate our utility business overall, which is just north of 50% of Xylem revenues will grow in the low to mid single-digits in 2021. We expect that same growth rate on the wastewater side as utilities continue to focus on mission-critical applications. And we expect modest recovery and OpEx growth on a global basis through the year. In the U.S. wastewater CapEx is likely to be down modestly. However, the decline should reflect postponements rather than reductions in projects. As you would expect, we've kept close to our utility customers to understand how they are thinking about budgets and funding for this year. And while some uncertainty remains the deepest concerns have largely abated since the low point of the pandemic. On the clean water side, we anticipate mid single-digit growth as I mentioned, large project deployments should begin ramping again from the second quarter, accelerating through the end of the year. The large multiyear metrology deals that we won in 2020 set us up for solid growth this year and beyond. In industrial markets, we've seen good sequential improvement. Short cycle orders and project activity are definitely beginning to pick up, but are still likely to be limited by COVID impacts in the near term. We expect industrial to be flattish to up low single-digits. Our commercial end market outlook varies quite a bit by geography. The U.S. will continue to be sluggish. Europe on the other hand, should continue recovering although none at the double-digit pace we saw in the fourth quarter. And overall, we anticipate the commercial market to be flattish to down slightly for the year. On Slide 12, you will see that we are reinstating annual guidance. While uncertainty remains especially regarding the timing and cadence of recovery. We are confident our team will deliver results in line with the following framework. For Xylem overall, we foresee full year 2021 organic revenue growth in the range of 3% to 5%. This breaks down by segment as follows, low to mid single-digit growth in water infrastructure with solid growth in wastewater utilities being partially offset by flattish performance in the industrial markets predominantly in our dewatering business. Low single-digit growth in Applied Water, while we see pockets of recovery in this segment globally, particularly in residential, the outlook for growth in the commercial building end market is more muted. On top of that, our exposure to North America is heavier and the region has lagged on pandemic recovery. In measurement and control solutions, we expect mid-single digit growth. Customers indicate project deployments will likely resume late in the second quarter and further accelerate through the second half of the year. We also expect to see our test assessment services and advanced digital solutions businesses building on the momentum they delivered finishing 2020. While we have typically provided you with both the adjusted operating margin and adjusted EBITDA margins in the past, you will notice that we are increasing our focus and reporting around adjusted EBITDA. We believe that this measure more accurately reflects the cash performance of our businesses and will enable us to more transparently report margin performance after M&A without purchase accounting impacts. For 2021, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be up 40 to 140 basis points to a range of 16.7% to 17.7%. For your convenience, we are also providing the equivalent adjusted operating margin here, which we expect to be in the range of 11.5% to 12.5% up 70 to 170 basis points. This predominantly reflects the benefits from our restructuring savings combined with volume leverage and favorable price mix more than offsetting inflation and investments. This yields an adjusted EPS range of $2.35 to $2.60, an increase of 14% to 26%. Free cash flow conversion is expected to be in the range of 80% to 90% following free cash flow conversion of 181% in 2020 and 124% in 2019. While we continue to drive continuous improvement, we expect to see increases in working capital as we returned to growth and some of the timing benefits we realized in 2020 related to the settlement of liabilities will reverse in 2021. We believe this is purely a dynamic related to 2021 and we expect to drive 100% cash conversion in 2022 and beyond. We have provided you with a number of other full year assumptions on the slide to supplement your models. One key item that I do want to draw your attention to is foreign exchange. We're assuming a euro to dollar conversion rate of 1.22. FX can be volatile and so and FX sensitivity table is included in the appendix, which will help you if we continue to see variations in the rates. Now drilling down on the first quarter, we anticipate that total company organic revenues will grow in the range of 1% to 3%. This includes low single-digit growth in Applied Water and low to mid single-digit growth in water infrastructure. M&CS is expected to decline low to mid single-digits as we anticipate continuing delays from COVID before projects begin deployment in Q2. We expect first quarter adjusted EBITDA margin to be in the range of 14% to 15% representing a 170 to 270 basis points of expansion versus the prior year with the largest expansion coming from M&CS due to operational improvements and a prior year warranty charge. And with that, please turn to Slide 13 and I'll turn the call back over to Patrick for closing comments. Yes, Mike thanks for the question. Obviously, as we work through the pandemic, the M&CS segment was our segment that was most impacted. And we saw that with steeper revenue declines which also impacted the margins. The business team took strong action throughout 2020 to make structural cost saving changes that are permanent. And we think that as we move through 2021, that is a segment where you're going to see the largest part of our margin expansion. And Mike, you're going to see that right from the get go out of the gate. When we look at Q1 that's also the segment that's going to have greatest margin expansion. And that comes from operational efficiencies from the restructuring, as well as we did have a one-time item last year. Mike, the one thing that I would add as we look out through 2021, you're going to see the strongest performance in Q4 from a margin perspective. And at that point in time, we would expect that we will be back at 2021. I'm sorry, we are back at 19 margin levels, and will be on good pace for margin expansion. Yes. Thanks Deane for the question. This is another project that we're very, very excited about, and it builds on the $250 million of awards that we announced earlier in the year. So this deal is about $40 million deal, it's primarily a water deal, and it's with a really powerful water utility. So it's one that we're quite pleased to bring into our backlog. Yes, Deane. Thanks for the questions. I've been here now for four months, and it's been really interesting, I think I'm still very excited about the opportunity for growth particularly by scaling our digital portfolio, and that's a journey that I think we're making good progress on, and very encouraged about the collaboration across the organization that there are digital opportunities that span the full portfolio. Also think your work is never done around continuous improvement and so there certainly is opportunity for us to continue to drive margin expansion, whether it's through conversion cost projects, further optimizing our footprint, there is opportunity there. Turning to your question on working capital, I think that the team did a terrific job on that this year, in years where your revenue growth declines, it's difficult to make improvements on a percentage basis, and the team did a super job on collections, bringing down our past dues, and we need to shout out and recognize our operations team on how they effectively managed and controlled inventory. So as we return to growth next year, working capital will be a little bit of a headwind. We're going to continue to drive continuous improvement initiatives whether it's scaling some of our financing programs with our suppliers and other efforts. But I think we're exiting in a pretty good spot there. I mean, I would add to that is a little bit is mix to. So in Europe, our concentration is heavier on the wastewater side, and that has been especially resilient during the pandemic. And as we move through 2021, we are expecting to see progress on clean water, especially as we can start rolling out those deployments. Yes, so I think there is multiple elements to that question. Let me try to break it down for you in a couple of different - pieces. So I'll start with restructuring. This year, we did take aggressive restructuring actions and we realized about $70 million of savings from those structural programs. As we look forward into 2021, we're expecting a similar level. We have some further programs in Europe that haven't been completed yet both related to footprint migration as well as overall efficiencies. But we do certainly expect to get those done in 2021 and that will help us from a year-over-year perspective. Discretionary costs is another bucket that we are focused on and as we look year-over-year we took about $60 million of costs out from discretionary categories like travel and entertainment, services, marketing et cetera. And our 2021 plan contemplates that about 40% of those costs will return. And then I would say that the third part of your question, you're starting to touch on inflation, which is probably the most challenging part of the equation. As you know we saw a very stable inflationary environment for most of 2020, did start to see that pick up at the end of 2020. And we're seeing that pressure continue in 2021. Our teams have gotten a little bit in front of that. So we have announced price actions that have been implemented in the first quarter, but the inflation around materials is something that we are watching very, very closely. Yes, I think that's a fair assumption. Yes, thanks Scott. I think as we move through the pandemic, we certainly clamp down on our spending around CapEx in 2020 and our outlook for CapEx for 2021 is very much in line with our historical spend levels. I think that a lot of our CapEx deployment is tied to our growth strategies and we're making investments on the digital side. We're making investments in emerging markets. We're making some investments in our manufacturing centers to drive continuous in improvement. And so it's something that we're going to watch closely throughout the year and make sure we face that increase accordingly. As we see recovery will start to release incremental CapEx dollars to position us for growth in 2022 and beyond. I don't think there is any structural reason. I think, we're going to continue to work at this. And I think the company has made steady progress over the years. And it's definitely something that we're not losing focus on we're not satisfied, but we're going to continue to drive that journey. Yes, I think Nate, you hit on a lot of the points there, and as we've modeled out 2021, we are modeling in good incremental margins through the portfolio. There is still some mix differences as we exit, M&CS has been a little bit delayed from a pandemic recovery perspective, and once we get that back on track and growing, you're going to see margin expansion ramp back up. I think the other thing is, we're continuing to make investments on the digital front, and those are prudent investments and we're phasing them throughout the year in line with the recovery, but I think that's probably the one piece that you may be overlooking in the model. Yes, let me take the first crack at that and then Patrick can chime in. I think as we think about the quarter sequential trends through 2021, yes, you almost have to think about how the pandemic impacted our businesses and regions throughout the year. And so I think right out of the gate in Q1, I think what's important is that we're going to return to growth and you're going to see meaningful margin expansion. From a margin perspective, the biggest growth happens in the first half of the year, because as you saw our margins were much stronger in Q3 and Q4 than they were in the earlier part of the year. And then I think as we focus and drill down on M&CS it's the deployments in the second half that from a dollar value perspective starts to accelerate, and as we exit 2021, again, I think our revenue and margin levels will be very much in line with what we experienced in 2019. I would say it's probably more high-single digits. FX is one of our key variables and key assumptions and we've guided to a 1.22 euro to dollar conversion rate. I think the way that I think about FX in particular, is that the euro is the most important currency pair for us, and a 5% variation in the euro drives about $50 million of revenue and about $20 million of margin. So I think that's a good way to frame it. Yes, there still will be some pressure in Q1 from a COVID perspective, but in the second half of the year, we're expecting that it's more neutral. Yes, I think that we did give you an outlook on what we expect to spend from our restructuring and realignment perspective and we also provided you with the tax rate. So I think we've given you all the inputs to model. But I think big picture, if you look at 2019 through 2021. We expect free cash flow conversion to be 130% which is very healthy. I think there is - three discrete headwinds for 2021. The first one we talked about earlier on the call is as we return to growth there'll be some add-back from working capital. We talked about resuming CapEx to be more in line with historical levels. And I think the third one is more unique to 2020 and 2021. And that is there were a number of liability categories that we benefited from the timing on. That benefit was about $75 million in 2020, two-thirds of that will reverse next year, but I think that's largely a one-time phenomenon. And so yes, 80 to 90 is lower than our historical target, but three years being at 130 I think is a good spot."

            "name": "Patrick Decker",
            "content": "Thanks, Matt and good morning everyone. As you'll see from our release this morning, the team delivered a strong performance in the fourth quarter, giving us good momentum entering 2021. Every segment and every end market made considerable gains on a quarter sequential basis. And for Xylem overall, the team outperformed expectations across the major metrics, those being revenue, earnings, and cash. As the year came to a close, we took full advantage of stabilizing markets. Both Water Infrastructure and Applied Water Systems showed quicker resilience than anticipated, and we also affirmed our growth trajectory in Measurement & Control Solutions. Building on the large project wins we talked about last quarter by adding at headline AMI deal in Houston, Texas. We also gathered pace with our industry-leading digital portfolio, as the pandemic accelerated customer adoption of digital transformation. The revenue in orders trends both improved significantly. One caveat is that orders were still down slightly due to the scope reduction in a previous large win in India. Otherwise, orders grew in all three of our segments. Xylem's large installed base of core products and established markets provided exceptional resilience on underlying demand for essential services. At the same time, our global presence allowed us to capture the benefits of early recovery in places like China, which grew 18% in the quarter, and also in Europe where we grew 6%. As a result of that positioning on a large and resilient installed base combined with a vibrant growth platform, we enter 2021 with healthy backlogs. They are up 16% overall and up 30% shippable in 2022 and beyond. We know growth rarely happens in a straight line. And clearly the global challenges of 2020 put a hedge on year-on-year numbers including margin, but I am very pleased with how we respond to given these conditions. We took quick action on spending and on structural cost and we also made significant productivity improvements. As a result, we returned to progress on margins in the third and fourth quarters, although we didn't entirely offset COVID effects. Our supply chain execution in-store we cut customer served pandemic and we help them to deliver the central services their communities depend upon. Our operational discipline delivered favorable bottom line outcomes even in unfavorable market conditions strengthening our financial position through the year. The team corrected for the volatile conditions so quickly that in fact we delivered free cash flow conversion north of 180%. Looking ahead, we are encouraged by early signs of market recovery. The ramp up of vaccinations offers hope for an eventual return to normalcy. But we're not there yet. We are still in uncertain times, but we have nevertheless in our 2021 in a very strong position, and we are on course to capitalize on our increased competitiveness, financial strength, and commercial momentum. With that, I'll now want to hand it over to Sandy for more detail on how our segments performed. Thanks, Sandy. 2020 reminded us all that it's prudent to be humble about the fidelity of our foresight. When COVID first began to spread around the world, we said we would focus on managing what we could control. While maintaining our investment for growth and that's exactly what we've done. So with 2021 still presenting some uncertainty, we will apply the same kind of focus that guided us throughout 2020. In our earnings call almost exactly a year ago I said that I expected operational discipline would be a key capability for us. I couldn't have anticipated then how much we do benefit in that capability. When 2020's big challenges arrived the team delivered on cost, on working capital, on free cash flow and on driving commercial value from our large installed base. We're still in a challenging environment. So we'll continue to face spending until we further see improvement in our markets. We'll keep executing the structural cost program begun in 2020 which is going to deliver savings through 2021. And given some of the inflationary headwinds, we're already seeing we are redoubling our efforts to manage the price cost dynamic. We're keeping a very close eye on our supply chains and proactively managing potential inflationary and logistics impacts. Despite varying by market and geography, there are clearly opportunities for growth in a recovering environment. In digital transformation, the pandemic demonstrated the imperative of operational and financial resilience for utilities which is precisely the value proposition of our advanced digital solutions. Pre-pandemic the business case was already very compelling. But as utility operators work heroically to keep essential services running the stresses of the pandemic made it clear that new approaches are required. Remote monitoring, automated operations and smart infrastructure more broadly, continue to see increased demand. Backlog in our advanced digital solutions grew 70% year-on-year. Although it's from a small base the trajectory is clear. It puts us in a very attractive position as we grow not only in software platforms, but in all of the digitally enabled parts of our portfolio. Geographically, India and China will continue to drive high growth. Despite experiencing COVID earliest impacts China actually grew last year. And in the three years leading up to 2020, India and China post a combined average annual growth rates in the double-digits. With localization strategies well advanced in both countries. Our China and India teams are set to continue delivering impressive growth. It's also worth mentioning a very solid financial foundation underpinning our growth with the current cash balance of nearly $1.9 billion capital deployment is clearly top of mind for us. Even with some debt repayment during the fourth quarter that number still offers a lot of capacity. Alongside organic investment M&A remains a top priority and we intend to be proactive in our deployment of capital wherever the investment case warrants. We remain disciplined about valuations, but we do see opportunity for additional investments over the next 18 months. Growth is also important to our creation of social value. We are in the very privileged position that sustainability is baked into our business model and strategy. Our portfolio of solutions has a net positive impact not only a water, but on a wide range of sustainability outcomes. We took several bold steps on sustainability in 2020 most notably, our Green Bond offering. And performance across these metrics continues to put us in unique leadership position both in the water sector and more broadly. The team's progress has strengthened our position on a number of sustainability indices. We were recently added to Bloomberg Barclays MSCI Green Bond Index. Despite that gratifying recognition, we have so much more work to do to achieve our 2025 sustainability goals and to deliver on our mission. I'm now going to turn it over to Sandy to provide end-market and segment outlook. Thanks, Sandy. We recognize both the marketplace is stabilizing and that is still like would be unsettled for some time. But we come into the New Year, with good momentum and an even stronger position emerging from the pandemic then when we entered it. That position is built on a durable business model. We have vital products at the heart of essential services and we have differentiated technology that provides a multiyear runway for attractive growth. Our mission has perhaps never been more relevant and our underlying investment thesis remains robust. Our near-term performance is delivering results and we continue to invest for sustainable growth. That's in line with our long-term strategy to create both economic and social value for our shareholders, our customers and our communities. We'll provide an update on our key strategic priorities and our long-term plans at a virtual Investor and Analyst Day planned for later this year, where I look forward to sharing more detail on our technology and solution capabilities and to discussing our growth strategies. So now operator with that, we'll turn the call over to you for questions. Yes, Mike, we've got a number of these large deal deployments. I think recently we've won as much as north of $300 million of large deals in 2020. Those are going to begin to ramp as site access returns and we just continue to have some really good commercial wins here. And when I say good meaning they come with very attractive accretive margins in those deals. That is correct. Yes. So Mike, no real change and our focus areas in the M&A funnel. I mean we've got a number of kind of smaller bolt-on tuck-ins that we'll be executing this year, but we are staying very close to a couple of larger actionable items as well. So again, we've got a keen eye on valuations and we do understand the value of organic growth, and again we're going to continue to remain disciplined. But we're optimistic. Sure. So I'll let Sandy take the Houston project question, I'll focus here on India. So, we still remain very positive on India, Deane. We've seen double-digit growth the last few years, we've got a great backlog there. Obviously the top policy mandate by Prime Minister, Modi continues to be the case there. This was a unique descoping on one project, where it was a little bit driven by an element of nationalism and so we are still going back and negotiating on that. We don't see that as part of a broader trend, it was very unique, very localized in one particular state, and again we just want to be appropriately conservative to reflect a reduction now in our orders. We'll see how it plays out, but no change in our view at all, Deane on India. Yes, Deane it's an AMI deal, it is new, it is a share gain for us and displacing someone that was there before. And so it will fit in that digital landscape as you think about the communications offering from FlexNet on the Sensus side. Yes, I think it's, we're still early innings here, Deane, I would say there are two dynamics at play. One is as you pointed out, the utilities are moving now from these things being nice to have, the must haves especially with remote monitoring, restricted labor deployment capabilities, but secondly, we are in the early innings still in terms of, we put new structure in place for the last year, we put new incentives in place to really drive synergies more broadly. So it's not just about the artist known as Xylem view our digital revenue. It's also the impact that has on pulling through other deals, yes, Houston being a good example of that. We talked about Columbus, Winston-Salem late last year. So we're taking a broader view on this Deane and then just the digital revenue component. It really is the impact it has on our broader portfolio. And Deane not to belabor it, but just to remind all of our investors that our three primary annual incentive plan metrics, our organic revenue growth, it's operating margin, operating income, and it's free cash flow conversion of which the single biggest driver there is working capital as a percentage of revenue. And so I just want to make sure we reminded all of our investors that we're not taking our foot off of working capital in any way, shape or form. Yes, I think part of this is a timing issue for the U.S. We're in the early stages of recovery there. It also is as Europe traditionally has been more stable in terms of how utilities focus on their spending and how they plan their budgets accordingly. We also benefit from a very strong share position in Europe. And so when that's the case, the level of aftermarket recurring revenue benefits us quite significantly there, but I wouldn't read too much into the - I wouldn't suggest that Europe is going to outpace the U.S. over time. I think really just more a matter of timing right now. And I would just add that, we are clearly looking at the level of uncertainty here in terms of what inflation is likely to be. And we're trying to be appropriately kind of measured in how we are reflecting that in our guide for the year. This is not unchartered territory for us in terms of the whole price cost dynamic. We've been here before think back to the tariff timeframe. Our price realization we're expecting that - along with productivity will offset material and labor inflation. We've got a very strong and proven procurement team and they are in lockstep with our commercial teams on making sure that we've got that that highlighted. So, again as Sandy said, we are already using pricing actions. The impact our different across each one of the segments based upon the impact on commodities. But we just thought it would be prudent to guidance we've done. Yes, Scott I would say, I would just add to Sandy's point we're going to continue to manage the phasing on CapEx. We'll see how the year plays out in terms of market recovery. There is no one or two big bang CapEx projects that are in there. It's pretty well distributed and it very much is tied to growth. So, I would just reinforce what Sandy said it's localization within emerging markets. It's some upgrade in terms of continuous improvement in a few of our factories. But it also is a fair amount, tied to the work that has to be done to support some of the large deal wins that we have within M&CS. Our biggest challenge Scott and it is kind of endemic within the water sector is. We still have work to do to simplify our supply chain and that has an impact on inventory levels. So I would say, if you look at our receivable performance. Our payable performance, we're pretty much in line there. There is some opportunity there, but it's not - that's not really going to move the needle. It really is structurally on the inventory side and that's work that Tony Milando and our supply chain team have been very much focused on it made good improvement but there still in my view a fair ways to go. Yes, Nate, I think the other piece I would say is, it's really important to focus on and we can certainly get more clarity on this second half versus first half what the exit rates are in terms of both top line growth and margin. You're looking at the full-year or average. Again we're talking operating margins. Yes. We do expect the activity and dewatering to ramp in the second half of 2001. Part of that is we put some more sophisticated pricing models in place that are going to be driving high margin rental, because rental really is a key focus area there for us, it really also is tied to what we're expecting in terms of the North America, industrial and commercial business. We've seen quite encouraging performance in January with opportunities not only in the U.S. but also growing in Western and Southern markets. So we'd expect about flattish to low single-digit growth for '21 to your last point. It depends on the sector within the water space. Obviously things that are of a higher digital nature that has more of a recurring revenue kind of SaaS nature of the model across any sector those are always going to have higher multiples and premiums. I think we're proud of the work the team has done in a number of these areas that we look at our relationships that we've built over a number of years. And so a number of these things don't actually go through an auction process. And that's really where I think the seller finds Xylem be an attractive partner because of our global breadth, our channels to market the breadth of our portfolio. And again, we tend to look at some of the smaller M&A to be really a proxy for R&D. And so, again we're going to be disciplined in this regard, but no, I'm still very encouraged by what we see in the pipeline. Yes, so I mean we're generally positive on the early indications from the new administration. Having said that, it's far too early to know anything beyond intentions and policy outlines we're not assuming. We're building into our forecast anything for an infrastructure bill, because we really need to see what ultimately is scoped in. But again discussions and indications on plans thus far do seem to include water as part of that focus, which we find obviously very encouraging. But our utility customers have also made it clear with us that they are not assuming or planning for it. And again they would say, we've seen that movie before with previous new administration that came in. But clearly, if and when we do see something on infrastructure that's going to be a big net positive for us. Given that our portfolio touches nearly all parts of the water cycle. Yes, I wouldn't look at it in terms of adding complexity to M&CS. I think - the way we think about it is, just adding to the portfolio of solutions that we can bring to most notably the clean water side of the utilities and so as we are in there and doing concentrated work. We continue to see areas of opportunity where we can bring more digital to the portfolio. So I wouldn't look at it is adding complexity, I take your point. Obviously, any time that we look at smaller start-ups that we add to the portfolio scaling them and getting channel to market. Obviously, is one of the big synergies that we bring, but we do that with great confidence. Yes, yes I think you're right Joe. I think, we're expecting the business is going to start to come back and be positive for us this year. I think we're a little cautious on calling that. We have also seen that movie play out before. And so that's one that we'd like to see the activity really come back. I think - there is normal seasonality in some of the North America side in terms of weather and doing some of that construction and industrial activity. Part of its lagged a little bit because of COVID to Joe, because think about this as a very much a people-driven business, it's very much hand-to-hand out in construction yards and so forth. And so, as they're not able to get out onsite and do some of that work. Then there has been some noise there. We expect it's going to come back though here in 2021. Thank you, John. Thanks. So again I appreciate. We all appreciate the continued support and interest. Thanks for joining the call today. I want to wish you all a happy and healthy New Year. I know we're already - it's hard to believe we're already more than a month into it. But again hopefully all your families and friends are safe and sound. Look forward to catching up with you and in our next earnings call. And as we said earlier, we'll be scheduling and planning an Investor and Analyst Day sometime later this year and we'll get back to you all on that. So, thank you all very much and have a great weekend."

Now please turn to Slide 4, and I will turn the call over to our CEO, Patrick Decker.\nPatrick Decker: Thanks, Matt. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I hope all of you and those close to you are keeping safe and well. As reflected in our release this morning, our third quarter performance was better than anticipated. The teams\u2019 operational execution was strong right around the world. You\u2019ll recall that after the low point of April, we saw sequential improvements in May and June. And we continue to build on that positive trajectory through the summer. Our team took advantage of the market regaining pace and exceeded our revenue and margin guidance for the quarter while generating very strong cash flow. This performance reflects the teams\u2019 focus on serving our customers and managing what we can control, whatever the dynamics are of the macro environment. Through the quarter, we saw solid foundations of recovery in a number of places. And we\u2019re well-positioned to further capitalize on that momentum. The pandemics impact hasn\u2019t been uniform of course, conditions varied significantly both by geography and by end market. For example, China revenue returned to healthy growth of 17%. Western Europe overall was back to relative stability at 2% growth. The U.S. saw only slight recovery still dealing with pandemic response and coming in at down 11% although improving sequentially. In our end markets, we\u2019ve seen ongoing resilience in the wastewater side of utilities and our wastewater solutions returned to solid growth in the quarter. On the clean water side, we\u2019re delivering strong commercial momentum, including winning large long-term transformational metrology deals, leveraging our differentiated platform, particularly in advanced metering infrastructure. In addition to big wins with Anglian and in Winston-Salem, which we mentioned last quarter, the team recently won another marquee project in Columbus, Ohio worth $94 million. This customer is a combined utility meaning we will provide both water and electricity meters plus advanced software and services. It\u2019s worth noting how compelling our value proposition is for combined utilities, addressing both water and energy applications with one portfolio and leveraging our unique FlexNet communication capability across both platforms to achieve economies of scale. The Columbus, Winston-Salem and Anglian deals have together added about $0.25 billion to Xylem\u2019s backlog. Our metrology and communications offerings are clearly differentiated in their own right, but we also have the advantage of delivering unique value by combining infrastructure platforms with complimentary digital solutions. Each value proposition enhances the other. As anticipated COVID impacts are causing delays in some metrology projects where timelines have shifted to the right. And in parts of the U.S. replacement meter installations have been pushed out in the short-term. Pipeline assessment services of business that requires putting people on site has been affected by COVID driven restrictions on travel and field work. At the same time, the pace of interest in digital solutions for remote monitoring and automated operations have accelerated. The pandemic has not only spot lit essential services. It has also eliminated utilities need for much greater operational and financial resilience, which is now at the top of every utility operator\u2019s agenda. Digital transformation has gone from being attractive to becoming an imperative and that\u2019s reflected in strong quoting activity and our digital solutions business, which has also increased by 50% its number of revenue generating clients. The revenues are still a small part of our top line, but the acceleration of interest further strengthens our view on digital adoption in the sector. And as the number inside of this project growth, we are seeing a broadening scope of opportunities across software, services and infrastructure products. What we don\u2019t expect this to be a straight line recovery Xylem is well-positioned irrespective of how the pandemic plays out. We anticipate quarter sequential improvements. Our financial health and liquidity are both strong. We\u2019re successfully reigning in cost, executing the actions we announced earlier this year. And we\u2019re shifting investment to adapt quickly to customer\u2019s evolving needs and new ways of working. Our supply chain has been exceptionally resilient with the team keeping customer supplied even through the pandemics peaks. So we\u2019re operating with discipline, strengthening our competitive position and helping our customers serve their communities with uninterrupted essential services, despite whatever macro uncertainty may persist. As Matt mentioned at the top of the call, both Mark and our new CFO, Sandy Rowland are with us today. Sandy joined us on October 1 and it\u2019s been a great pleasure to welcome her to the team. But since Mark was in the chair through the end of the reporting period, he will carry the commentary on our third quarter performance. So Mark over to you.\nMark Rajkowski: Thanks, Patrick. Please turn to Slide 5 and I\u2019ll cover our Q3 results in more detail. Revenue declined 7%, which was better than anticipated as we entered the third quarter. We had strong performance in our wastewater utility businesses in the residential end market both of which grew mid-single digits in the quarter. The return to growth in these markets was offset by the expected declines in our metrology project deployments and industrial and commercial businesses, which continue to be impacted by project delays and site restrictions. Geographically, as various countries have reopened and recovered, so has our business. In China for example, we saw very strong performance with double-digit year-over-year growth. Despite the China business returning to pre-pandemic growth rates, emerging markets overall declined 7%. India was down only modestly while the Middle East in Latin America declined double-digits, they continued to be impacted by shutdowns throughout the quarter. Across North America, recovery remains mixed. While revenues improved quarter sequentially, they were down year-over-year. While our wastewater business remained resilient, we continue to see timing effects on metrology deployments and softness in industrial markets. Western Europe grew 2% in the quarter as countries reopened in activity resumed with revenue growing in each of our end markets with the exception of industrial. We also saw operating margins expand quarter sequentially to 13%, which drove EPS of $0.62 both better than expected. I\u2019ll cover the margin impacts by segment shortly. Overall, our teams maintained very sharp focus and executed well operationally by driving strong productivity and cost reductions. Please turn to Slide 6 and I\u2019ll review third quarter results by segment. Water infrastructure orders declined 5%. Order trends in our wastewater utility businesses continued to be solid. Treatment orders were up 20%. Wastewater transport orders down 9% for the quarter would have been up mid-single digits, but for lapping the large deal we won last year in India. Orders in the industrial end market were soft due to double-digit declines in our de-watering business. Long-term backlog continues to build as we\u2019re up over 30% for backlog shippable in 2021 and beyond. Segment revenues declined 2% in the quarter compared to the prior year. This was better than anticipated and reflects the resilience of utility spending to run and maintain their wastewater operations. Our wastewater transport business grew 4% in the quarter. And we saw continued strength in our treatment business, which grew 3% in the quarter. The growth in treatment reflects what has been to date, the relatively uninterrupted deployment of wastewater CapEx projects. The de-watering business experience continued softness. Revenues declined 14%, most of which was in the North American construction and industrial markets, which have seen \u2013 which have been significantly impacted by site closures and access restrictions. Operating margin in the quarter was 18.5% down modestly year-over-year from higher inflation, lower volumes and unfavorable mix. However, the margin performance exceeded our expectations as the team strong execution on cost reductions and productivity initiatives delivered 630 basis points of margin expansion. Now please turn to Slide 7. Orders in the Applied Water segment declined 1% in the quarter and revenues declined 4% as softness in the industrial and commercial markets continued, particularly in the United States and the Middle East. The commercial end market declined 5% in the quarter. As a reminder, this business is roughly two-thirds weighted towards repair and replacement work, which held up relatively well in the quarter despite shutdowns in some regions. Industrial was affected by similar regional dynamics, including site access restrictions and declined 7%. A bright spot in the quarter was residential, which grew 4%. We saw particularly strong growth across Western Europe and from China. Overall, emerging markets declined 8% in the quarter. China had a very strong performance growing 23% as the team executed well, delivering on pent-up demand. This was more than offset by the declines in the Middle East in Latin American regions due to the ongoing lockdowns. Revenue in the United States declined 6%, but improved quarter sequentially with some softness across end markets driven by continued virus impacts. Operating margin in the segment was 15.9%. Volume declines and inflation impacts reduced margins in the quarter, but were largely offset by 530 basis points of cost reduction and productivity benefits. Now please turn to Slide 8. Measurement and control solutions orders declined 19% in the quarter and revenue declined 15%. We saw project timing significantly impact our metrology business. And COVID-19 restrictions push out our project revenues in our pipeline assessment services business. In metrology, we\u2019ve seen relative stability in our OpEx replacement business from water metrology products. As a reminder, our OpEx exposure accounts for about 70% of our revenues. We\u2019ve seen much more variability in the 30% of our metrology business that\u2019s tied to large project deployments or CapEx, particularly in our gas segment, where project revenues were down 60% in the quarter. Here, we\u2019ve been significantly impacted by project timing, particularly from lapping a large gas metrology project deployment, which was largely completed at the end of last year and delays in another large gas project this year due to home access restrictions. Despite, these challenges, our underlying North American water metrology book-and-bill business has remained relatively stable and commercial momentum in winning new projects remains robust. This is highlighted by the large contract wins we had in the first half of the year and continued into the third quarter with the Columbus, Ohio and Winston-Salem, North Carolina wins. Patrick already covered Columbus, but I\u2019ll quickly highlight a couple of important points on the Winston-Salem win. This is a $60 million contract to provide water metrology products under our network as a service offering, leveraging our FlexNet communications network. Importantly, our teams differentiated the value of our offering by introducing several components from our digital solutions platform, enabling our customer to also seamlessly address critical needs around non-revenue water and their wastewater network. Our pipeline assessment services business has also been subject to significant near-term delays in project revenues, driven by COVID-19 travel restrictions and site closures. As a reminder, there are two businesses within AIA, digital solutions and pipeline assessment services. It\u2019s in the latter business, where we\u2019ve experienced deferrals pipe inspection work. And we expect those push outs to continue into early 2021. As a result, we booked an accounting charge reflect the impacts of those delays. We continue to strongly believe that the medium and long-term value proposition of this business is compelling. Particularly, as utilities move to address budget challenges by using pipeline assessment services to reduce future spend on pipe replacement. We expect the project timing for deploying new metrology projects and the COVID-19 related delays in pipeline assessment services to continue to impact us through the fourth quarter. This is reflected in our fourth quarter guidance, which Sandy will cover later, as shippable backlog for the fourth quarter is down roughly 25%. That said, it\u2019s significant that we\u2019ve not had any project cancellations. Rather, we\u2019re seeing an acceleration of growth in our project pipelines and we continue to win large new contracts. As a result MCS shippable backlog in 2021 and beyond is up over 30%, which is a pretty good indication of the power we\u2019re seeing with our digital platform. So while these projects aren\u2019t currently reflected in the orders metric, they are the latest in a series of important wins that give us confidence in the medium and long-term growth profile of this segment. EBITDA margin in the segment was 14.8%. Year-over-year margin decline was driven by lower revenues of high margin North American metrology and pipeline assessment services, due to project timing and COVID-19. This impact was partially offset by 630 basis points of cost reduction in the quarter. Now please turn to Slide 9 and I\u2019ll cover our cash flow performance for the quarter. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.6 billion of cash and short-term investments and $2.4 billion of liquidity driven by a very successful green bond issuance last quarter, combined with our strong cash flow performance throughout the year. In the phase of substantial challenges presented by the pandemic, I\u2019m very proud of the work of our teams in managing all aspects of our working capital performance. At quarter end, working capital was 20.3% of sales, representing an improvement of 30 basis points versus this time last year. The teams focus on working capital, disciplined CapEx spending and cost control through the quarter have continued to pay off, enabling us to generate free cash flow of $234 million. A conversion rate of over 200% in the quarter, which did see some benefit from favorable timing on payments, primarily related to taxes and interest. Before I turn it back over to Patrick, I\u2019d like to take a moment to congratulate Sandy and welcome her as she steps into this new role. Having worked with Sandy previously, I wasn\u2019t at all surprised by how quickly she\u2019s come up to speed on our businesses in our markets and the pace with which she\u2019s developed relationships, all virtually and taken on the leadership of the global finance team over the past month. I couldn\u2019t be more confident about the future of Xylem or in Sandy\u2019s capability to help Patrick and the team accomplish our mission and take the company\u2019s performance to the next level. So with that, I\u2019ll hand it back to Patrick for the last time.\nPatrick Decker: Thanks, Mark. Before turning to our outlook, I just want to take a moment to reiterate two overall trends we\u2019re saying, as we look forward. The first is the influence of regional differences around the world. As you\u2019ve heard, we\u2019ve already seen big distinctions between China, Europe and the U.S. in the third quarter. So long as the impact of COVID-19 continues to influence demand, we believe those geographic effects will be considerable through at least the end of the year. Xylem\u2019s global diversification puts us in a strong position as we serve the international markets that are farthest along in the recovery curve. It\u2019s worth noting for example, that about 70% of our wastewater business is outside the U.S. The second overall trend to highlight is a shift of attention from reactive operational imperatives to medium and longer-term resilience. The pressures utility space at the beginning of the pandemic are well-known. You simply can\u2019t stop providing an essential service, even if you\u2019re struggling to [indiscernible] and more end users than usual or having trouble paying their bills. Our customers have come through the most intense part of the crisis, serving their communities heroically. It\u2019s also been a wakeup call for the sector. Utilities leaders and operators have become acutely aware of the pressing need to invest in greater operational and financial resilience. Part of that investment will go to conventional infrastructure that will have to be combined with new approaches, if utilities are to address their overarching challenges, making the cost of infrastructure more affordable, extending asset life and dramatically increasing labor efficiencies while maintaining safety. So we\u2019ve seen interest continued to ramp up in digital transformation, remote monitoring, automated operations and smart infrastructure more broadly. Of course, the implications of digitizing utility networks goes deeper than software platforms and our digital solutions business. Beyond software and end points, transformation also requires the digitally enabled pumps and drives that make up the backbone of a smarter network, which is why we are implementing an integrated digital strategy across our entire portfolio. We\u2019re very excited about the opportunity of working with our customers to build the digital water and energy networks that will carry their communities into the future. Turning from those trends to outlook. In general, we have a much clearer view on Q4 than we had on Q3. We\u2019re seeing stabilization in a number of markets. We have even greater supply chain confidence and we\u2019re executing well on cost. All of which leads us to expect quarter sequential improvement in margins. So by end market, I\u2019ll start with our outlook for utilities. The wastewater side has been exceptionally resilient. We expect OpEx to continue holding up well, given the need to serve as mission critical applications. And capital projects with secured funding continue to move forward. On the clean water side, as I mentioned, we have strong commercial momentum with multi-year projects like Anglian, Winston-Salem and Columbus, setting us up for healthy growth in 2021 and beyond. In the short-term, we expect performance trail wastewater due to more pronounced COVID impacts, but we\u2019re not seeing structural changes in demand and the growth profile of the segment is expected to remain highly attractive. We simply anticipate some continuing COVID impacts on deployment timing. And standard meter replacements are likely to remain soft until physical distancing eases. Please turn to Slide 11. Looking at industrial and commercial end markets, the accessibility of industrial sites varies widely by region, where COVID response has lagged. There have been site access restrictions and work has been deferred. So we\u2019re still anticipating softness to the fourth quarter, especially North America construction and industrial markets affecting our dewatering business. And in commercial, it\u2019s a mixed picture that varies by end customer. Demand and hospitals, data centers and apartment buildings, for example, is very different than for offices and hotels. But less building use overall and soft North America construction suggest continued softness in the near-term. Now I have the great pleasure of turning over to Sandy for the first time, so she can provide some more specifics on our Q4 guidance.\nSandy Rowland: Thank you, Patrick, and hello everyone. I just want to kick off by expressing how excited I am to have joined the Xylem team. I joined Xylem because of the unique combination of strong commercial opportunities for growth and the compelling mission of the company. Xylem is also complimentary to my previous experiences, which has included bringing together cutting edge technologies with industrial products. I spent the last month getting up to speed with the team alongside Mark and I look forward to all we have ahead of us rounding out 2020 and beyond. With that, let\u2019s get into a few more details on our fourth quarter guidance. On the top line, we expect organic revenues in the range of down 6% to down 8%. This is a modest improvement in sequential performance versus the third quarter. As we break it down by segment, we anticipate being down low single digits in Water Infrastructure, down mid single digits in Applied Water and down mid-teens in Measurement & Control Solutions. Reflecting the project deployment delays, we\u2019ve continued to see through October. Operating margin in the quarter is expected to be in the range of 13% to 13.5% also a modest quarter sequential improvement. I also want to highlight a few full year items. We expect to end 2020 with free cash flow conversion of greater than 100% for the full year. Restructuring and realignment costs are now expected to be between $75 million and $85 million, slightly lower than our previous guidance, while structural annual cost savings remain unchanged at approximately $70 million. We\u2019re lowering our estimated tax rate this year to 18.5% to reflect our updated mix of earnings. Before I hand it back to Patrick for some closing comments, I want to again, thank Mark for his guidance during this transition. Having worked with Mark before, I know he and I bring similar perspectives and share a common approach to operational excellence and driving investment in innovation to support sustainable growth. Mark has built a great team and I\u2019m confident we have the organizational capability to focus to deliver. Now, please turn to Slide 13.\nPatrick Decker: Thank you so much, Sandy. It\u2019s great to have you on the team. Just to wrap up before turning the call over to your questions, the team continues to demonstrate strong operational delivery. And that will enable us to capitalize on recovery everywhere, it\u2019s happening through the end of the year and beyond. And we will execute from a position of competitive strength, even in the more challenging environments. Our discipline on cost and cash will continue to pay off, both in the coming quarter and through 2021. Looking ahead, that quality of operational execution will enable us to continue driving sustainable margin expansion. Our robust financial health, which gives our customers confidence that they can rely on us in uncertain times is built on the foundations of a strong balance sheet and cash generation. Our leading market positions are paired with a differentiated product portfolio and a durable business model at the heart of essential services. And our strategy places Xylem and the lead as the water sector\u2019s digital adoption curve accelerates, providing a multi-year runway of attractive growth. We will deploy capital to continue strengthening our portfolio, investing in the solutions and services that anticipate our customers\u2019 needs. Both the economic and the social returns of those investments will be attractive over the medium and long-term. And our commitment, great value for all our stakeholders will continue to underpin the sustainability and resilience of our company, our customers and our communities. We\u2019re now going to move to your questions, but first I need to mention that although Mark will be advising us through the end of the year, this is his last earnings call. So let me take this opportunity to say once again, as I\u2019ve said before, that all of Xylem stakeholders have benefit profoundly from Mark\u2019s leadership and tenure at Xylem, but none more than me. As I have benefited tremendously from his counsel. Thank you, Mark. And with that, I\u2019d like to turn it over to your questions. So operator, please lead us into Q&A.\nOperator: The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question is coming from Scott Davis with Melius Research.\nScott Davis: Okay. Yes, just a bit of a bad connection, perhaps, but anyways. Are you guys surprised if you can hear me, of course? Are you surprised by \u2013 okay, good. Are you surprised by the negative price the extent of it? I can\u2019t remember a quarter or you had this big of a cost price dislocation. So perhaps maybe dig into that a little bit more.\nMark Rajkowski: Yes. Hey, Scott, it\u2019s Mark. The price overall for the company in the quarter was 50 \u2013 up 50 basis points, so we continue to drive price. A lot of the inflation has been labor related and we had some very strong price increases over the past 18 months. And some of this is reflective of the demand profile in the market. So we continue to look to drive for price and get value for the products and services that we rendered, but it\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019re doing it all within the context of the current competitive environment.\nScott Davis: Does that mean, Mark, you\u2019re seeing pretty our tougher price in the rental markets. Two, we\u2019ve heard some competitors say, it\u2019s actually been pretty stable this quarter. So I was curious to see what your view is\u2026\nMark Rajkowski: It\u2019s competitive in the rental market for sure. Again, some of that\u2019s a function of the demand profile. And but that\u2019s not \u2013 it\u2019s not the only market. We\u2019re seeing it in a number of areas, but our teams are out there being very thoughtful and certainly where there are opportunities to push on price, particularly where we\u2019re differentiated they\u2019re doing that.\nPatrick Decker: Yes. I would say, Scott, this is Patrick. Price has not really been a concern of ours. It\u2019s not really been a meaningful change in trajectory. Obviously, we\u2019ve been thoughtful during the pandemic, but there\u2019s no structural change here in terms of how we feel about price in the market. And I would say that, especially for us, we really focused in on engineered solutions versus commodity oriented offerings and where we have the more engineered solutions, we\u2019ve built those into our base business, but also knew our contracts. And that pricing has remained a constant, in other words, we\u2019ve not gone back and renegotiated contracts. We haven\u2019t had people coming back to us asking for changes in pricing, given the pandemic that\u2019s been very stable.\nScott Davis: Okay. That\u2019s super helpful. Thanks. I\u2019ll pass it on. Thank you. Good luck guys.\nPatrick Decker: Thank you, Scott.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.\nDeane Dray: Wish Mark all the best and thanks for all your help.\nMark Rajkowski: Thanks, Dean. Yes, you got cut off there a little bit. You\u2019re a little choppy there, but I heard the last part of it [indiscernible] wanted to hear.\nDeane Dray: Yeah, let me just say it, again. It just was also the welcome to Sandy. And appreciate all the color here this morning. This is the first question, and this is an important part of the theme for Xylem. Is this accelerated interest in smart water systems by the utilities? We also do water conference in September. We heard that directly from the utilities that we\u2019re all saying this, you got to win in Columbus that\u2019s impressive. So Patrick, the big question is how did this interest in quote activity start to translate into orders? We are seeing traction here, but if you can maybe give us some size, what the quote activity is, what the expectation is around the timing.\nPatrick Decker: Sure. Yes. Thanks Deane, and good morning. So yes, as we mentioned that at your conference, and I know many of the utility leaders spoke to this. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the utility leaders all that I\u2019ve spoken to this. This has really been one of the silver linings of the pandemic as the amount of time that I\u2019ve had with these leaders by Zoom and other platforms is they really \u2013 they have moved from a number of beads digital solutions being a nice to have to imperative. And just to reinforce, as I miss in my comments, the drivers behind that are the whole issue of them dealing with issues of how do they manage their assets remotely. How do they manage their workforces remotely? They are very much focused, especially, post-pandemic on this issue of portability. So and again, I remind everyone that only 30% of our utility exposure is in the U.S., it\u2019s a very different kind of funding and economic dynamic outside of the U.S., whether it be in China and India or Europe. But here in the U.S., 70% of their funding comes from \u2013 70% of their spending is on OpEx. And that comes from their existing rate base. When you think about the remaining 30%, which is CapEx that comes from new rate cases that need to be justified. So on the base case, on the OpEx, they\u2019re looking for ways to reduce the operating expense, to extend the asset life of those assets, to do remote work. On the CapEx side, it really is about making those new projects affordable. So they can get rate cases approved. So anything that we\u2019re able to do to reduce the cost of that new CapEx and make it more affordable is going to be even more important to them as they come out of the pandemic. In terms of \u2013 what we\u2019re seeing in terms of proof points, we\u2019re seeing that we\u2019ve had a 50% increase in the number of clients. That\u2019s one. We\u2019ve seen in north of a 20% uptick in orders. So there is conversion there in terms of orders off of a small base, but a growing base. These typically are from the time that we get an expression of interest and we\u2019ve seen a big uptick there, of course, with the 50% increase. It\u2019s about a 12 to 18-month conversion on the digital side from \u2013 going from an expression of interest into \u2013 turning that into an order and then into revenue. But secondly, what I would say, most importantly here, Deane, is that it\u2019s not just the digital component. It\u2019s the broadening, it\u2019s the opportunity that gives us to broaden the scope of deals that we would otherwise be negotiating. So some of the AMI deals on the metrology side, we would not have won them, if it were not for digital offering that we bring in compliment to AMI. That\u2019s as important as actually going in and leading with digital and then pulling through AMI or also on the wastewater pumping side, the treatment side. So the synergies here from a pull through standpoint, go two different directions. It can be \u2013 we leave with digital, we help the utility, understand where their needs are. And then we bring in solutions behind that on the hardware and networking side, but it can also be where we\u2019re already in there negotiating on the hardware side and the digital comes in over the top and differentiates us versus others. So that\u2019s where we see the biggest opportunities going forward. And the expression of interest right now is absolutely accelerating based upon the economic challenges that the utilities are facing.\nDeane Dray: That\u2019s great to hear. And then just to clarify, I knew it was like a year ago, the focus was on pilot programs. And it sounds to me, some of those were revenue generating. But are you waiting for any of the pilot programs to convert to orders and where does that stand?\nPatrick Decker: Sure, certainly. I mean, when we say that there is a 50% increase in client acquisition. Those are predominantly speaking to pilots. And so we continue to see pilots increasing now. I want to be clear, when we say pilots, these are revenue generating pilots. We\u2019re not giving these things away. And I would say that again, that balance of interest is as much outside of the U.S. as it is inside of the U.S. So we\u2019re seeing big uptick in China, India, Europe and then certainly equally as much in the U.S.\nDeane Dray: Great. And I just had a follow-up question for Mark. Just didn\u2019t want I think he was getting off easy. Decrementals were touch weaker than what we were expecting, and I\u2019m just trying to bridge that difference. And did that include the charge that came through on the pipe inspection or just help us understand decrementals and then what you\u2019re expecting for the fourth quarter?\nMark Rajkowski: No. That was on an operational basis. Now are you talking about Q3 or the Q4 outlook?\nDeane Dray: Q4 outlook.\nMark Rajkowski: Yes. Yes. And so some of that is just a function of mix, okay, so we\u2019re continuing to see impacts in several of our lines of business, whether it\u2019s dewatering, whether it\u2019s some of the pipeline assessment work or in senses that our metrology deployments that are higher margin that are most impacted from a mixed perspective in the fourth quarter.\nDeane Dray: Got it. Much appreciated. Thank you.\nPatrick Decker: Thank you, Deane.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones with Stifel.\nNathan Jones: Welcome to the team, Sandy, and best of luck, Mark. It\u2019s been a pleasure getting to know you over the last few years.\nMark Rajkowski: Yes, same here. Thanks, Nathan.\nNathan Jones: I\u2019d like to dig into MCS a little bit more here. You have a large domestic meter competitor, who put up some double-digit growth in the third quarter and was probably more bullish on the outlook. Less concerned about kind of project delays that you were talking about here today. I know you have other lines of business and a lot more international things going on in here. It sounds like the pipe inspection businesses is one of the worst ones. Could you may be digging a little bit more to the different pieces of MCS. What you\u2019re seeing specifically on the domestic water meter business and how that outlook progresses\nPatrick Decker: Nate, good morning. This is Patrick. So first of all, I think when you look at the \u2013 let\u2019s take the metrology piece of the business first, which is opposite the lion\u2019s share of M&CS. Because I think we can take digital solutions off the table. It\u2019s trending very well, for the reasons that I expressed to Deane earlier. We\u2019ll come back to pipeline assessment in a moment. Obviously, there we\u2019ve had challenges in terms of site access. It\u2019s not been an issue in terms of level of interest. The orders are there. The work is there. It really is literally a matter of getting access on the site, given the nature of the work that\u2019s done there. So back to metrology, which is, obviously, the Sensus business there again on the, that kind of 70% to 80% of our business there of that revenue is again basically meter replacement. The day-to-day kind of installation of replacement meters. That business was down low to mid single digits in the quarter. And that largely was again, site access restriction, a big chunk of that and differentials between us and maybe others. Some are similar, some are different from a competitive standpoint. It really depends largely, where you are geographically. And so we\u2019ve got a heavier presence in some of the larger metro areas, certainly here on the East Coast, where there\u2019ve been tighter COVID restrictions and perhaps parts of other \u2013 the rest of the country. So we were down low to mid single digits in the Q3. We expect that business to be up low single digits in Q4 as site restrictions begin to ease, like, obviously, that depends upon this kind of next wave of the virus. So we keep our eyes closely on that. But right now in our assumptions, we expect that to begin to recover and see growth in Q4 and certainly into 2021, where it normalizes. It really the piece in Sensus that hit us in Q3 was the capital projects. These large deals that we won and executed last year, so one, we have a tough versus last year. Two, this year, we had some of the projects that we had already won. Think about fairly water, very large project, $100 million project. That has been shifted to the right. It\u2019s not been canceled. It\u2019s simply a matter of site access. And so we do see that coming back in Q4 and certainly into 2021. It\u2019s also when you look at the \u2013 we had some delays in some of our gas project implementations, again, because of COVID. So a number of these projects that are pandemic related are still there. They\u2019re going to be executed. They\u2019re simply a matter of shifting out to the right, because of timing of being able to get people on site. When you look at, we also had \u2013 when you look at the backlog that we\u2019ve got. Our shippable backlog for the metrology business for 2021 and beyond is up 30%. So this is not an issue of projects being canceled or projects being deferred with uncertainty, it\u2019s simply a matter of site access. And so we\u2019re very confident about that. When you think about the wins that we\u2019ve got and Winston-Salem, Columbus, et cetera. That really speaks to the health of the market overall. The dynamic competitively is simply the fact that we have a larger project orientation of our business, because of the AMI deals that we\u2019re winning versus a base meter replacement business.\nNathan Jones: I think that makes a lot of sense, and I would have expected you guys to have a higher share in more densely populated areas, where your site access could be different. All of the folks that we\u2019ve talked to on the utility side have said that, the non-revenue water pipe assessment projects and the made a deployment are likely to really go unaffected. If you take it over a few quarter kind of timeframe, which would suggest to me that all this is doing here is really creating pent up demand. It\u2019s going to be released here over the next couple of quarters. And should probably really all get caught up in 2021. This is not shifting permanently to the ride, it\u2019s shifting the front end to the right, but the back end should be fixed.\nPatrick Decker: That\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re seeing, Nate, and that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m hearing from the utility leaders that I speak to is when you think about the long-term structural demands in the water sector around the issues of affordability of water, whether it be at the macro level, meaning at the rate case level, whether it be affordability at the end user, meaning a household owner. Those issues are becoming even more prominent, because of the pandemic, whether it be scarcity of water on the clean water side, whether it be the resilience of their infrastructure. What we\u2019re hearing from the utility leaders is that it\u2019s becoming even more prominent for them, coming out of the pandemic. The issue is simply depending upon where you\u2019re looking around the country, because this really is more of U.S. phenomenon, the geographic differences are stark in terms of the approach to the pandemic.\nNathan Jones: I think that all makes a lot of sense. Thanks for the color.\nPatrick Decker: Thank you, Nate.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Connors with Boenning & Scattergood.\nRyan Connors: Great. Thanks, Mark. And welcome, Sandy. My question, a bit of a bigger picture question. One of the kind of discuss the utility market from a different angle, in terms of the municipal utilities versus the investor owned utilities. I know, if you listen to the investor owned utilities, since this thing is a hit, they\u2019re really now talking up the outlook for privatization, saying, that some of these more stressed local systems are really coming under financial strain, and that\u2019s an opportunity for them to really accelerate their acquisitions and expand. And so I wanted to get your take on that theme, in terms of, A, remind us of your current customer mix between those two groups and how they compare in terms of pricing and margins and that sort of thing. And then B, are you seeing that, do you see that? And if so, would that be a good thing, a bad thing indifferent? What\u2019s your take on that privatization angle here?\nPatrick Decker: Sure. Yes. Great question. So certainly as you obviously will know the whole privatization debate has been going on for quite some time and it\u2019s a quite contentious view within the utility space. And it\u2019s always harder for the private utilities to do the consolidation than what they would certainly like. But we certainly see that has been a trend that is accelerating for the reasons that you mentioned in terms of some level of economic distress in the sector to be transparent. The private utility portion of our revenue is certainly far less than the public as you well know. And while we love our public owned utilities and we\u2019ve got a great share there across the board. When \u2013 typically, we find that when utilities are privatized, it does become a slightly bit easier negotiation, because it\u2019s then become \u2013 it comes down a bit more to basic fundamental economics, returns on investment. It\u2019s easier to sell longer-term solutions into them, based upon the paybacks and financial benefits. That\u2019s not to say that on the public side, it\u2019s the exact opposite. That\u2019s just \u2013 it\u2019s a mix of utilities in terms of how they think about that. But we see that, Ryan, very much as a positive trend for us over time. But again, I wouldn\u2019t want to parse between public and private as to whether one is good or the other one not. And I know you\u2019re not suggesting that.\nRyan Connors: Sure. No, that\u2019s understandable. But no, that is useful perspective. My other question is a little more tactical, but you mentioned residential as a tailwind in Applied Water and your release in your slides there, that\u2019s not a market. You normally talk a lot about it and there was material enough that, that you did put it in there pretty prominently. Can you just remind us of what exactly you\u2019re doing there and sort of the outlook and what the real materiality is there?\nMark Rajkowski: Yes. Hey Ryan, it\u2019s Mark. And you\u2019re right. That has not been a recent highlight. And but the business has done a really nice job in really upgrading, improving their product sets there. And the \u2013 what we\u2019ve seen is that as more folks have spent more time at home, working from home. They\u2019re spending more money on those homes, including well pumps and other products that, that they need to maintain them. So there\u2019s been really strong growth, not just in Europe, but we\u2019ve seen some pent-up demand in the Asia-Pacific region. And even in the U.S., we\u2019re seeing improvements and expect that to continue into the fourth quarter. So it\u2019s a function of just one of the impacts of the pandemic, but also importantly some nice improvements that our team has made to our product sets in that area.\nPatrick Decker: Yes. So I would just add that, I think that again, this is Patrick, I would say to compliment what market indicated there, the team has done a great job of enhancing some of the product offerings. And we continue to build out that pipeline. But I would say this is a predominantly a short-term phenomenon. We don\u2019t have a different look over long-term as to what you should expect from a growth standpoint in that business. I mean it really is kind of a low-single digit, kind of GDP, kind of business. In this quarter, it was predominantly driven by growth \u2013 outsize growth that we saw in Europe and in China that really spiked the numbers. And that was really the reason we called it out.\nRyan Connors: Got it, okay. That makes sense. Thanks so much.\nPatrick Decker: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Joe Giordano with Cowen.\nJoe Giordano: Hey guys.\nPatrick Decker: Hey Joe.\nMark Rajkowski: Hey Joe.\nJoe Giordano: Just wanted to keep going on the digital side here. I don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s really debating the how valuable those types of technologies are long-term to utilities. I think the value proposition is pretty clear. But when we were just recently serving utilities, we got a pretty clear response that like near-term those types of digital and technology investments were being de-prioritized, because of necessity and where they have to spend money. So like what are your thoughts on push outs or anything like for capital projects that are maybe signed, but not shows in the ground yet like, it seems like that stuff has more risk of being pushed like more meaningfully outward. Just kind of what are you seeing there?\nPatrick Decker: Sure, Joe. So I \u2013 again I \u2013 as you know, I\u2019m always prone to do here. Let\u2019s first talk global. So again 30% of our utility exposures in the U.S. versus outside of the U.S., and so this is a global phenomenon, and we\u2019re seeing even more, I\u2019d say outsize interest in the emerging markets that\u2019s the first point. Two would be in North America or specifically in the U.S., what we\u2019re seeing there is, as we\u2019ve indicated, we always view these projects as being, you do a pilot, it\u2019s a 12 to 18-month conversion from the pilot into orders and revenue. And the way that we\u2019ve structured these arrangements, where we\u2019re leading with purely digital, where our team goes in, and they\u2019re doing a diagnostic, a consultative diagnostic with the utility, that that whole thing, I mean it\u2019s not a high cost venture for the utility. It\u2019s to help them understand what are the needs they\u2019ve got, where do they spend the next dollar of capital or OpEx going forward. And that helps inform them on how they can manage their OpEx and CapEx needs more effectively. And those situations, when we talk about pull through, that\u2019s always going to be a 12 to 18-month kind of horizon. And we\u2019ve got proof points of those already in hand. The other approach to selling is where a team is going in most notably when it\u2019s an AMI metrology deal. And it\u2019s a competitive bid and we\u2019re able to overlay unique digital solutions, whether it be meter optimization, whether it be adding on leak detection where it\u2019s a non-revenue water solution, these are the kinds of things that can oftentimes help us seal the deal. That\u2019s the proof point there is the $0.25 billion of deals that we\u2019ve gotten over the last quarter or two, where absolutely the digital piece of the offering was a proof point that helped secure that deal. So these are not high cost items for a utility as it relates to purely the digital component. It\u2019s as much an enabler for them as they go forward. But no doubt in the immediate term, there are utilities that have had to make tough choices between the wastewater side, the clean water side is just a nice to have versus a need to have. We see that momentum accelerating. But as we said before, this is still a relatively small piece of our revenue and the opportunity is all in front of us.\nJoe Giordano: Yes, I think that\u2019s fair. Last question from me, just I\u2019m pure and yes, I understand that this is like the most on, no one could have kind of budgeted or thought of what\u2019s going on now. But we\u2019ve had over the last few years write down to basically half the investment now. So just curious as to how that kind of informs the capital deployment decisions going forward and how you kind of evaluate new potential targets?\nPatrick Decker: So I will \u2013 let me take that one first, Joe, and I\u2019ll have Mark kind of walk through kind of the thinking behind the write down of additional goodwill, et cetera. Strategically our view on this business is we remain very bullish on this business. Again, when you think about the needs, the utility has around reducing their non-revenue water, a big part of that is leak detection. And so everything I\u2019ve heard from the utilities I\u2019ve spoken to is they absolutely see that as being essential, but right now again, it is site access. And when they have to \u2013 when you think about the nature of the crews that we deploy around basically brand name appear, the crews that we deploy there are traveling across state lines. They\u2019re very technical. So we have to deploy them broadly. There are basic what\u2019s \u2013 the requirements of being sequestered when you\u2019re traveling state lines, I mean they\u2019re very practical aspects of stalled of our workforce right now that nobody could have possibly imagine coming into this. But the fundamental needs remain the same. When you think about the fact that only \u2013 that market is only been penetrated by like 3% of the need, all that opportunity is in front of us. And it\u2019s going to be even more essential coming out of the pandemic than it was before because of the whole affordability angle. I\u2019ll let \u2013 so there\u2019s no fundamental change in view on this business. In our view, in terms of how attractive it is. I\u2019ll let Mark talk about kind of the accounting drivers behind why there was a second impairment on this.\nMark Rajkowski: Yes, I mean \u2013 and I know you\u2019re in a trained accountant by background. So you get all. This is really a function of as Patrick said, a significant temporary delay in the expected revenues to our pipeline assessment services business. So it\u2019s more of a push out to the right by a couple of years. And when you look at this business, the margin \u2013 the gross margin profile of that business is greater than 50%. So really rich gross margins. So when those revenues push out, it\u2019s \u2013 it has a big impact on the discounted cash flows used is determined the fair value of the business. And you\u2019ll also \u2013 when we did our first write down last year about a year ago, you write that down to, you\u2019ve reset the fair value and that\u2019s fair value is based on these future forecasted revenues. So you really don\u2019t have a lot of headaches. So when you see a shock like this from the pandemic, it has an impact in terms of the accounting. And as Patrick said long-term \u2013 medium-term, long-term opportunities in this business, we remain very positive.\nPatrick Decker: And Joe, we take our nature on these things, whether it be from an accounting standpoint or an outlook perspective is we take a conservative approach on this. I mean we want to make sure that we\u2019re write down the middle of fairway. We\u2019re not going to move things around. And so we \u2013 the team felt it important at this point in time, given the shock of the pandemic on this particular business, most notably given its still based services aspect, that this was a \u2013 it was a responsible thing for us to do, but no change in strategic view on the assessment services business.\nJoe Giordano: Two you, and Sandy look forward to it. Thanks guys.\nMark Rajkowski: Thanks.\nPatrick Decker: Thanks, Joe.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Hey, good morning, guys.\nMark Rajkowski: Hi Andy.\nPatrick Decker: Good morning.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Patrick, you mentioned that your utility businesses more international than the U.S. So it was good to see Europe returned to growth and China was obviously very strong. But can you give us more color into your thinking about these regions going forward? Have you seen any curtailing of the momentum you recently had in Europe given the virus resurgence. Maybe any more color would be helpful.\nPatrick Decker: Yes, it\u2019s a great question. And thanks for the international thing given that the largest piece of that, that market for us. The \u2013 so we certainly \u2013 we just continue to see momentum building in Asia. And we feel, I mean, obviously who knows, I can\u2019t prognosticate on the pandemic and where cases are going to resurge, et cetera. But certainly within Asia, we have no reason to have any concerns either in Q4 or going into 2021 based upon what we see right now, if anything, the pent-up demand, we got hit first earliest in Q1 and in Q2 because of our weighted exposure in China and India. And our teams have proven very resilient there as has the market. So that that\u2019s agent, we would expect that to have now returned to pre-pandemic levels. With respect to Europe, obviously we like all of you are monitoring case count. We\u2019re seeing what\u2019s happening in the resurgence here for the last few days. There is uncertainty there. We feel that our guide for Q4 is a balanced guide, obviously, if there was disproportionate shock to the system that needs to be kind of factored in to our outlook for Q4. But our teams have been managing through this pandemic and the complexity of the pandemic for several months now. And one of the most important things that we\u2019ve learned is really making sure that we have a resilient and robust supply chain. And it\u2019s not just us, but the suppliers around us in the ecosystem. And so we don\u2019t believe that there is a near-term meaningful impact on our business in the quarter around that. But there is uncertainty there. And so we want to make sure that we continue to monitor that, but it really is too early to tell at this stage. So we think we\u2019ve taken a balanced approach to the quarter.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Thanks for that, Patrick. And then just can you help us think about this probably for Mark or Sandy, the structural cost savings that you\u2019re focused on and how that can manifest itself beyond Q4? I mean you already mentioned decrementals are still a little high in Q4 versus normal, but as you go into 2021, would you expect to see improved decrementals and/or incrementals given the level of cost out that\u2019s ramping for you?\nMark Rajkowski: Yes. And this is Mark. And the \u2013 for a couple reasons, one, we\u2019ll see some ramping in terms of the structural costs into 2021.\nPatrick Decker: Cost savings.\nMark Rajkowski: Cost savings, yes. And yes, cost savings. And then it\u2019s early to call, but when you think about the costs that were going to be coming off and as we move through into 2021, that additional volume will certainly play well relative to the what will then be incrementals.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Thanks, Mark. Appreciate it.\nMark Rajkowski: Yes.\nPatrick Decker: Thank you.\nOperator: We have time for one final question. Your last question comes from the line of Brett Linzey with Vertical Research Partners.\nBrett Linzey: Hey, thanks for squeezing me in guys. Hey just wanted to circle back to\u2026\nPatrick Decker: Good morning.\nBrett Linzey: Yes. How you\u2019re doing? And yes, Mark, congratulations on the retirement, and best of luck to Sandy. But just want to start with MCS.\nMark Rajkowski: Thank you.\nBrett Linzey: Encouraging to see better engagement on the software and SaaS side, but just wanted to understand the profitability and monetization of that. Should we think of those opportunities as sort of an MCS average margin out the gate and then something that scales over time or does it kind of lower in the initial part of that contract? And any color you can give us in terms of how those contracts will work once they\u2019re executed. Thanks.\nPatrick Decker: Sure. So I\u2019ll take it first. This is Patrick. Yes, no, the projects that we\u2019ve announced here, the deals that we\u2019ve talked about these would be accretive. These would not be \u2013 this is not one of those where you make a big, huge investment of margin upfront and that it pays back later. These are accretive to the market \u2013 to the segment margins. And so and that\u2019s a big part of the attractiveness of the deals is the value that we are selling to the utility. And the payback it gives to them in terms of immediate revenue generation gives up the ability to really price it appropriately and protect ourselves from a future pricing kind of pressure once they\u2019re locked in, they\u2019re locked in. And we start making really, really attractive margins in the very offset. Mark?\nMark Rajkowski: Yes. I mean they\u2019re all \u2013 those are \u2013 those recent wins are our water deals and they\u2019re very profitable. And the service and software part on top of that makes them even more attractive in their longer-term.\nPatrick Decker: Yes. So typically the way these contracts would work is there\u2019s going to be depending upon the number of we call them end points, but then the number meters that are being installed. The metrology itself is very profitable. And then as those get installed, you layer on the ongoing monitoring piece of the contract, the data analytics piece of that contract, and the AI wrapped around that. Those are then kind of your SaaS margins that you would expect going forward. And those have a long tail again can be anywhere between 10, 15 years of revenue tied to these. It\u2019s a smaller piece of the contract. But even the large piece of the contract, which is meters is very attractive.\nBrett Linzey: Okay, got it. And then just one follow-up on the cost targets. Are we still thinking $80 million as structural for 2021? And then just trying to put a finer point on some of the moving cost items within 2020 in terms of temporary, the employee support costs and what that looks like in terms of the netting of kind of headwind or tailwind as we get into next year.\nMark Rajkowski: Yes. And I\u2019ll jump in. And the in terms of both the OpEx and the some of the costs that we\u2019ve incurred this year, I mean listen, we\u2019ve learned a lot in terms of working through the pandemic and we\u2019re going to be driving hard to keep \u2013 we found ways to keep these costs out, right. And so we\u2019d expect to be able to continue to maintain those efficiencies based on the learning. Secondly, the \u2013 in terms of the support costs in other payments that we\u2019ve made this year, certainly assuming we move through this, that will be some tailwind as well.\nPatrick Decker: Yes. I would just punctuate it by saying that, we\u2019ve \u2013 so the permanent structural savings that, that Sandy alluded to in the prepared remarks, we don\u2019t see any give back on that, that\u2019s \u2013 that should be locked in for 2021. So again you\u2019re talking about roughly $80 million of kind of ongoing savings there. And to Mark\u2019s point on the discretionary items, yes, I mean we like pretty much every other company. We started early on the discretionary side. We have $60 million of discretionary savings that are there. How much of that comes back. We\u2019re still in the planning process. But as Mark said, we\u2019ve learned a lot. We\u2019ve learned how to do a whole lot more with a whole lot less, becoming more efficient, effective, whether it be travel, remote working, making sure that our service providers and suppliers are doing the same thing. So our teams have gone back and renegotiated contracts there. And lastly, making sure that our own approach to work is aligned with what our customers are doing. And they too are \u2013 have pulled back significantly on their own discretionary costs in terms of people working from home, et cetera. So we\u2019re still working through that, but we\u2019re leaning in in a big way. So I wouldn\u2019t expect a lot of that to come back. There will be some, no doubt, because you always have some levels inflation on your wage and salaries, et cetera. We\u2019re going to do the right thing by our workforce over time, because we did take some very swift and aggressive actions on our head count during this pandemic. So we\u2019re going to remain disciplined and agile and what is otherwise an uncertain environment.\nBrett Linzey: Great. And just to point of clarification on the structural cost savings, so that the $70 million in 2020 and the $80 million in 2021, that\u2019s an incremental $80 million versus an incremental $10 million. Is that correct?\nPatrick Decker: Yes, yes.\nBrett Linzey: Okay, okay. Got it, all right. Thank you so much.\nPatrick Decker: Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached our allotted time for Q&A. I would like to turn the floor back over to Patrick Decker for any additional closing remarks.\nPatrick Decker: Thank you. So again I want to reiterate where I started that is I really hope that all of you and the people close to you are safe and healthy. Make sure you stay such. Really appreciate your continued interest and support. Thanks for joining the call today. And we\u2019ll be back in touch soon. Thank you all very much. And we won\u2019t speak to many of you at least as a group until after the holidays. So have a very safe and happy holiday season.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude today\u2019s Xylem third quarter 2020 earnings conference call. Please disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Sandy Rowland",
            "content": "Thank you, Patrick, and hello everyone. I just want to kick off by expressing how excited I am to have joined the Xylem team. I joined Xylem because of the unique combination of strong commercial opportunities for growth and the compelling mission of the company. Xylem is also complimentary to my previous experiences, which has included bringing together cutting edge technologies with industrial products. I spent the last month getting up to speed with the team alongside Mark and I look forward to all we have ahead of us rounding out 2020 and beyond. With that, let's get into a few more details on our fourth quarter guidance. On the top line, we expect organic revenues in the range of down 6% to down 8%. This is a modest improvement in sequential performance versus the third quarter. As we break it down by segment, we anticipate being down low single digits in Water Infrastructure, down mid single digits in Applied Water and down mid-teens in Measurement & Control Solutions. Reflecting the project deployment delays, we've continued to see through October. Operating margin in the quarter is expected to be in the range of 13% to 13.5% also a modest quarter sequential improvement. I also want to highlight a few full year items. We expect to end 2020 with free cash flow conversion of greater than 100% for the full year. Restructuring and realignment costs are now expected to be between $75 million and $85 million, slightly lower than our previous guidance, while structural annual cost savings remain unchanged at approximately $70 million. We're lowering our estimated tax rate this year to 18.5% to reflect our updated mix of earnings. Before I hand it back to Patrick for some closing comments, I want to again, thank Mark for his guidance during this transition. Having worked with Mark before, I know he and I bring similar perspectives and share a common approach to operational excellence and driving investment in innovation to support sustainable growth. Mark has built a great team and I'm confident we have the organizational capability to focus to deliver. Now, please turn to Slide 13."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Patrick Decker",
            "content": "Thanks, Matt. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I hope all of you and those close to you are keeping safe and well. As reflected in our release this morning, our third quarter performance was better than anticipated. The teams' operational execution was strong right around the world. You'll recall that after the low point of April, we saw sequential improvements in May and June. And we continue to build on that positive trajectory through the summer. Our team took advantage of the market regaining pace and exceeded our revenue and margin guidance for the quarter while generating very strong cash flow. This performance reflects the teams' focus on serving our customers and managing what we can control, whatever the dynamics are of the macro environment. Through the quarter, we saw solid foundations of recovery in a number of places. And we're well-positioned to further capitalize on that momentum. The pandemics impact hasn't been uniform of course, conditions varied significantly both by geography and by end market. For example, China revenue returned to healthy growth of 17%. Western Europe overall was back to relative stability at 2% growth. The U.S. saw only slight recovery still dealing with pandemic response and coming in at down 11% although improving sequentially. In our end markets, we've seen ongoing resilience in the wastewater side of utilities and our wastewater solutions returned to solid growth in the quarter. On the clean water side, we're delivering strong commercial momentum, including winning large long-term transformational metrology deals, leveraging our differentiated platform, particularly in advanced metering infrastructure. In addition to big wins with Anglian and in Winston-Salem, which we mentioned last quarter, the team recently won another marquee project in Columbus, Ohio worth $94 million. This customer is a combined utility meaning we will provide both water and electricity meters plus advanced software and services. It's worth noting how compelling our value proposition is for combined utilities, addressing both water and energy applications with one portfolio and leveraging our unique FlexNet communication capability across both platforms to achieve economies of scale. The Columbus, Winston-Salem and Anglian deals have together added about $0.25 billion to Xylem's backlog. Our metrology and communications offerings are clearly differentiated in their own right, but we also have the advantage of delivering unique value by combining infrastructure platforms with complimentary digital solutions. Each value proposition enhances the other. As anticipated COVID impacts are causing delays in some metrology projects where timelines have shifted to the right. And in parts of the U.S. replacement meter installations have been pushed out in the short-term. Pipeline assessment services of business that requires putting people on site has been affected by COVID driven restrictions on travel and field work. At the same time, the pace of interest in digital solutions for remote monitoring and automated operations have accelerated. The pandemic has not only spot lit essential services. It has also eliminated utilities need for much greater operational and financial resilience, which is now at the top of every utility operator's agenda. Digital transformation has gone from being attractive to becoming an imperative and that's reflected in strong quoting activity and our digital solutions business, which has also increased by 50% its number of revenue generating clients. The revenues are still a small part of our top line, but the acceleration of interest further strengthens our view on digital adoption in the sector. And as the number inside of this project growth, we are seeing a broadening scope of opportunities across software, services and infrastructure products. What we don't expect this to be a straight line recovery Xylem is well-positioned irrespective of how the pandemic plays out. We anticipate quarter sequential improvements. Our financial health and liquidity are both strong. We're successfully reigning in cost, executing the actions we announced earlier this year. And we're shifting investment to adapt quickly to customer's evolving needs and new ways of working. Our supply chain has been exceptionally resilient with the team keeping customer supplied even through the pandemics peaks. So we're operating with discipline, strengthening our competitive position and helping our customers serve their communities with uninterrupted essential services, despite whatever macro uncertainty may persist. As Matt mentioned at the top of the call, both Mark and our new CFO, Sandy Rowland are with us today. Sandy joined us on October 1 and it's been a great pleasure to welcome her to the team. But since Mark was in the chair through the end of the reporting period, he will carry the commentary on our third quarter performance. So Mark over to you. Thanks, Mark. Before turning to our outlook, I just want to take a moment to reiterate two overall trends we're saying, as we look forward. The first is the influence of regional differences around the world. As you've heard, we've already seen big distinctions between China, Europe and the U.S. in the third quarter. So long as the impact of COVID-19 continues to influence demand, we believe those geographic effects will be considerable through at least the end of the year. Xylem's global diversification puts us in a strong position as we serve the international markets that are farthest along in the recovery curve. It's worth noting for example, that about 70% of our wastewater business is outside the U.S. The second overall trend to highlight is a shift of attention from reactive operational imperatives to medium and longer-term resilience. The pressures utility space at the beginning of the pandemic are well-known. You simply can't stop providing an essential service, even if you're struggling to [indiscernible] and more end users than usual or having trouble paying their bills. Our customers have come through the most intense part of the crisis, serving their communities heroically. It's also been a wakeup call for the sector. Utilities leaders and operators have become acutely aware of the pressing need to invest in greater operational and financial resilience. Part of that investment will go to conventional infrastructure that will have to be combined with new approaches, if utilities are to address their overarching challenges, making the cost of infrastructure more affordable, extending asset life and dramatically increasing labor efficiencies while maintaining safety. So we've seen interest continued to ramp up in digital transformation, remote monitoring, automated operations and smart infrastructure more broadly. Of course, the implications of digitizing utility networks goes deeper than software platforms and our digital solutions business. Beyond software and end points, transformation also requires the digitally enabled pumps and drives that make up the backbone of a smarter network, which is why we are implementing an integrated digital strategy across our entire portfolio. We're very excited about the opportunity of working with our customers to build the digital water and energy networks that will carry their communities into the future. Turning from those trends to outlook. In general, we have a much clearer view on Q4 than we had on Q3. We're seeing stabilization in a number of markets. We have even greater supply chain confidence and we're executing well on cost. All of which leads us to expect quarter sequential improvement in margins. So by end market, I'll start with our outlook for utilities. The wastewater side has been exceptionally resilient. We expect OpEx to continue holding up well, given the need to serve as mission critical applications. And capital projects with secured funding continue to move forward. On the clean water side, as I mentioned, we have strong commercial momentum with multi-year projects like Anglian, Winston-Salem and Columbus, setting us up for healthy growth in 2021 and beyond. In the short-term, we expect performance trail wastewater due to more pronounced COVID impacts, but we're not seeing structural changes in demand and the growth profile of the segment is expected to remain highly attractive. We simply anticipate some continuing COVID impacts on deployment timing. And standard meter replacements are likely to remain soft until physical distancing eases. Please turn to Slide 11. Looking at industrial and commercial end markets, the accessibility of industrial sites varies widely by region, where COVID response has lagged. There have been site access restrictions and work has been deferred. So we're still anticipating softness to the fourth quarter, especially North America construction and industrial markets affecting our dewatering business. And in commercial, it's a mixed picture that varies by end customer. Demand and hospitals, data centers and apartment buildings, for example, is very different than for offices and hotels. But less building use overall and soft North America construction suggest continued softness in the near-term. Now I have the great pleasure of turning over to Sandy for the first time, so she can provide some more specifics on our Q4 guidance. Thank you so much, Sandy. It's great to have you on the team. Just to wrap up before turning the call over to your questions, the team continues to demonstrate strong operational delivery. And that will enable us to capitalize on recovery everywhere, it's happening through the end of the year and beyond. And we will execute from a position of competitive strength, even in the more challenging environments. Our discipline on cost and cash will continue to pay off, both in the coming quarter and through 2021. Looking ahead, that quality of operational execution will enable us to continue driving sustainable margin expansion. Our robust financial health, which gives our customers confidence that they can rely on us in uncertain times is built on the foundations of a strong balance sheet and cash generation. Our leading market positions are paired with a differentiated product portfolio and a durable business model at the heart of essential services. And our strategy places Xylem and the lead as the water sector's digital adoption curve accelerates, providing a multi-year runway of attractive growth. We will deploy capital to continue strengthening our portfolio, investing in the solutions and services that anticipate our customers' needs. Both the economic and the social returns of those investments will be attractive over the medium and long-term. And our commitment, great value for all our stakeholders will continue to underpin the sustainability and resilience of our company, our customers and our communities. We're now going to move to your questions, but first I need to mention that although Mark will be advising us through the end of the year, this is his last earnings call. So let me take this opportunity to say once again, as I've said before, that all of Xylem stakeholders have benefit profoundly from Mark's leadership and tenure at Xylem, but none more than me. As I have benefited tremendously from his counsel. Thank you, Mark. And with that, I'd like to turn it over to your questions. So operator, please lead us into Q&A. Yes. I would say, Scott, this is Patrick. Price has not really been a concern of ours. It's not really been a meaningful change in trajectory. Obviously, we've been thoughtful during the pandemic, but there's no structural change here in terms of how we feel about price in the market. And I would say that, especially for us, we really focused in on engineered solutions versus commodity oriented offerings and where we have the more engineered solutions, we've built those into our base business, but also knew our contracts. And that pricing has remained a constant, in other words, we've not gone back and renegotiated contracts. We haven't had people coming back to us asking for changes in pricing, given the pandemic that's been very stable. Thank you, Scott. Sure. Yes. Thanks Deane, and good morning. So yes, as we mentioned that at your conference, and I know many of the utility leaders spoke to this. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the utility leaders all that I've spoken to this. This has really been one of the silver linings of the pandemic as the amount of time that I've had with these leaders by Zoom and other platforms is they really \u2013 they have moved from a number of beads digital solutions being a nice to have to imperative. And just to reinforce, as I miss in my comments, the drivers behind that are the whole issue of them dealing with issues of how do they manage their assets remotely. How do they manage their workforces remotely? They are very much focused, especially, post-pandemic on this issue of portability. So and again, I remind everyone that only 30% of our utility exposure is in the U.S., it's a very different kind of funding and economic dynamic outside of the U.S., whether it be in China and India or Europe. But here in the U.S., 70% of their funding comes from \u2013 70% of their spending is on OpEx. And that comes from their existing rate base. When you think about the remaining 30%, which is CapEx that comes from new rate cases that need to be justified. So on the base case, on the OpEx, they're looking for ways to reduce the operating expense, to extend the asset life of those assets, to do remote work. On the CapEx side, it really is about making those new projects affordable. So they can get rate cases approved. So anything that we're able to do to reduce the cost of that new CapEx and make it more affordable is going to be even more important to them as they come out of the pandemic. In terms of \u2013 what we're seeing in terms of proof points, we're seeing that we've had a 50% increase in the number of clients. That's one. We've seen in north of a 20% uptick in orders. So there is conversion there in terms of orders off of a small base, but a growing base. These typically are from the time that we get an expression of interest and we've seen a big uptick there, of course, with the 50% increase. It's about a 12 to 18-month conversion on the digital side from \u2013 going from an expression of interest into \u2013 turning that into an order and then into revenue. But secondly, what I would say, most importantly here, Deane, is that it's not just the digital component. It's the broadening, it's the opportunity that gives us to broaden the scope of deals that we would otherwise be negotiating. So some of the AMI deals on the metrology side, we would not have won them, if it were not for digital offering that we bring in compliment to AMI. That's as important as actually going in and leading with digital and then pulling through AMI or also on the wastewater pumping side, the treatment side. So the synergies here from a pull through standpoint, go two different directions. It can be \u2013 we leave with digital, we help the utility, understand where their needs are. And then we bring in solutions behind that on the hardware and networking side, but it can also be where we're already in there negotiating on the hardware side and the digital comes in over the top and differentiates us versus others. So that's where we see the biggest opportunities going forward. And the expression of interest right now is absolutely accelerating based upon the economic challenges that the utilities are facing. Sure, certainly. I mean, when we say that there is a 50% increase in client acquisition. Those are predominantly speaking to pilots. And so we continue to see pilots increasing now. I want to be clear, when we say pilots, these are revenue generating pilots. We're not giving these things away. And I would say that again, that balance of interest is as much outside of the U.S. as it is inside of the U.S. So we're seeing big uptick in China, India, Europe and then certainly equally as much in the U.S. Thank you, Deane. Nate, good morning. This is Patrick. So first of all, I think when you look at the \u2013 let's take the metrology piece of the business first, which is opposite the lion's share of M&CS. Because I think we can take digital solutions off the table. It's trending very well, for the reasons that I expressed to Deane earlier. We'll come back to pipeline assessment in a moment. Obviously, there we've had challenges in terms of site access. It's not been an issue in terms of level of interest. The orders are there. The work is there. It really is literally a matter of getting access on the site, given the nature of the work that's done there. So back to metrology, which is, obviously, the Sensus business there again on the, that kind of 70% to 80% of our business there of that revenue is again basically meter replacement. The day-to-day kind of installation of replacement meters. That business was down low to mid single digits in the quarter. And that largely was again, site access restriction, a big chunk of that and differentials between us and maybe others. Some are similar, some are different from a competitive standpoint. It really depends largely, where you are geographically. And so we've got a heavier presence in some of the larger metro areas, certainly here on the East Coast, where there've been tighter COVID restrictions and perhaps parts of other \u2013 the rest of the country. So we were down low to mid single digits in the Q3. We expect that business to be up low single digits in Q4 as site restrictions begin to ease, like, obviously, that depends upon this kind of next wave of the virus. So we keep our eyes closely on that. But right now in our assumptions, we expect that to begin to recover and see growth in Q4 and certainly into 2021, where it normalizes. It really the piece in Sensus that hit us in Q3 was the capital projects. These large deals that we won and executed last year, so one, we have a tough versus last year. Two, this year, we had some of the projects that we had already won. Think about fairly water, very large project, $100 million project. That has been shifted to the right. It's not been canceled. It's simply a matter of site access. And so we do see that coming back in Q4 and certainly into 2021. It's also when you look at the \u2013 we had some delays in some of our gas project implementations, again, because of COVID. So a number of these projects that are pandemic related are still there. They're going to be executed. They're simply a matter of shifting out to the right, because of timing of being able to get people on site. When you look at, we also had \u2013 when you look at the backlog that we've got. Our shippable backlog for the metrology business for 2021 and beyond is up 30%. So this is not an issue of projects being canceled or projects being deferred with uncertainty, it's simply a matter of site access. And so we're very confident about that. When you think about the wins that we've got and Winston-Salem, Columbus, et cetera. That really speaks to the health of the market overall. The dynamic competitively is simply the fact that we have a larger project orientation of our business, because of the AMI deals that we're winning versus a base meter replacement business. That's exactly what we're seeing, Nate, and that's exactly what I'm hearing from the utility leaders that I speak to is when you think about the long-term structural demands in the water sector around the issues of affordability of water, whether it be at the macro level, meaning at the rate case level, whether it be affordability at the end user, meaning a household owner. Those issues are becoming even more prominent, because of the pandemic, whether it be scarcity of water on the clean water side, whether it be the resilience of their infrastructure. What we're hearing from the utility leaders is that it's becoming even more prominent for them, coming out of the pandemic. The issue is simply depending upon where you're looking around the country, because this really is more of U.S. phenomenon, the geographic differences are stark in terms of the approach to the pandemic. Thank you, Nate. Sure. Yes. Great question. So certainly as you obviously will know the whole privatization debate has been going on for quite some time and it's a quite contentious view within the utility space. And it's always harder for the private utilities to do the consolidation than what they would certainly like. But we certainly see that has been a trend that is accelerating for the reasons that you mentioned in terms of some level of economic distress in the sector to be transparent. The private utility portion of our revenue is certainly far less than the public as you well know. And while we love our public owned utilities and we've got a great share there across the board. When \u2013 typically, we find that when utilities are privatized, it does become a slightly bit easier negotiation, because it's then become \u2013 it comes down a bit more to basic fundamental economics, returns on investment. It's easier to sell longer-term solutions into them, based upon the paybacks and financial benefits. That's not to say that on the public side, it's the exact opposite. That's just \u2013 it's a mix of utilities in terms of how they think about that. But we see that, Ryan, very much as a positive trend for us over time. But again, I wouldn't want to parse between public and private as to whether one is good or the other one not. And I know you're not suggesting that. Yes. So I would just add that, I think that again, this is Patrick, I would say to compliment what market indicated there, the team has done a great job of enhancing some of the product offerings. And we continue to build out that pipeline. But I would say this is a predominantly a short-term phenomenon. We don't have a different look over long-term as to what you should expect from a growth standpoint in that business. I mean it really is kind of a low-single digit, kind of GDP, kind of business. In this quarter, it was predominantly driven by growth \u2013 outsize growth that we saw in Europe and in China that really spiked the numbers. And that was really the reason we called it out. Thank you. Hey Joe. Sure, Joe. So I \u2013 again I \u2013 as you know, I'm always prone to do here. Let's first talk global. So again 30% of our utility exposures in the U.S. versus outside of the U.S., and so this is a global phenomenon, and we're seeing even more, I'd say outsize interest in the emerging markets that's the first point. Two would be in North America or specifically in the U.S., what we're seeing there is, as we've indicated, we always view these projects as being, you do a pilot, it's a 12 to 18-month conversion from the pilot into orders and revenue. And the way that we've structured these arrangements, where we're leading with purely digital, where our team goes in, and they're doing a diagnostic, a consultative diagnostic with the utility, that that whole thing, I mean it's not a high cost venture for the utility. It's to help them understand what are the needs they've got, where do they spend the next dollar of capital or OpEx going forward. And that helps inform them on how they can manage their OpEx and CapEx needs more effectively. And those situations, when we talk about pull through, that's always going to be a 12 to 18-month kind of horizon. And we've got proof points of those already in hand. The other approach to selling is where a team is going in most notably when it's an AMI metrology deal. And it's a competitive bid and we're able to overlay unique digital solutions, whether it be meter optimization, whether it be adding on leak detection where it's a non-revenue water solution, these are the kinds of things that can oftentimes help us seal the deal. That's the proof point there is the $0.25 billion of deals that we've gotten over the last quarter or two, where absolutely the digital piece of the offering was a proof point that helped secure that deal. So these are not high cost items for a utility as it relates to purely the digital component. It's as much an enabler for them as they go forward. But no doubt in the immediate term, there are utilities that have had to make tough choices between the wastewater side, the clean water side is just a nice to have versus a need to have. We see that momentum accelerating. But as we said before, this is still a relatively small piece of our revenue and the opportunity is all in front of us. So I will \u2013 let me take that one first, Joe, and I'll have Mark kind of walk through kind of the thinking behind the write down of additional goodwill, et cetera. Strategically our view on this business is we remain very bullish on this business. Again, when you think about the needs, the utility has around reducing their non-revenue water, a big part of that is leak detection. And so everything I've heard from the utilities I've spoken to is they absolutely see that as being essential, but right now again, it is site access. And when they have to \u2013 when you think about the nature of the crews that we deploy around basically brand name appear, the crews that we deploy there are traveling across state lines. They're very technical. So we have to deploy them broadly. There are basic what's \u2013 the requirements of being sequestered when you're traveling state lines, I mean they're very practical aspects of stalled of our workforce right now that nobody could have possibly imagine coming into this. But the fundamental needs remain the same. When you think about the fact that only \u2013 that market is only been penetrated by like 3% of the need, all that opportunity is in front of us. And it's going to be even more essential coming out of the pandemic than it was before because of the whole affordability angle. I'll let \u2013 so there's no fundamental change in view on this business. In our view, in terms of how attractive it is. I'll let Mark talk about kind of the accounting drivers behind why there was a second impairment on this. And Joe, we take our nature on these things, whether it be from an accounting standpoint or an outlook perspective is we take a conservative approach on this. I mean we want to make sure that we're write down the middle of fairway. We're not going to move things around. And so we \u2013 the team felt it important at this point in time, given the shock of the pandemic on this particular business, most notably given its still based services aspect, that this was a \u2013 it was a responsible thing for us to do, but no change in strategic view on the assessment services business. Thanks, Joe. Good morning. Yes, it's a great question. And thanks for the international thing given that the largest piece of that, that market for us. The \u2013 so we certainly \u2013 we just continue to see momentum building in Asia. And we feel, I mean, obviously who knows, I can't prognosticate on the pandemic and where cases are going to resurge, et cetera. But certainly within Asia, we have no reason to have any concerns either in Q4 or going into 2021 based upon what we see right now, if anything, the pent-up demand, we got hit first earliest in Q1 and in Q2 because of our weighted exposure in China and India. And our teams have proven very resilient there as has the market. So that that's agent, we would expect that to have now returned to pre-pandemic levels. With respect to Europe, obviously we like all of you are monitoring case count. We're seeing what's happening in the resurgence here for the last few days. There is uncertainty there. We feel that our guide for Q4 is a balanced guide, obviously, if there was disproportionate shock to the system that needs to be kind of factored in to our outlook for Q4. But our teams have been managing through this pandemic and the complexity of the pandemic for several months now. And one of the most important things that we've learned is really making sure that we have a resilient and robust supply chain. And it's not just us, but the suppliers around us in the ecosystem. And so we don't believe that there is a near-term meaningful impact on our business in the quarter around that. But there is uncertainty there. And so we want to make sure that we continue to monitor that, but it really is too early to tell at this stage. So we think we've taken a balanced approach to the quarter. Cost savings. Thank you. Good morning. Sure. So I'll take it first. This is Patrick. Yes, no, the projects that we've announced here, the deals that we've talked about these would be accretive. These would not be \u2013 this is not one of those where you make a big, huge investment of margin upfront and that it pays back later. These are accretive to the market \u2013 to the segment margins. And so and that's a big part of the attractiveness of the deals is the value that we are selling to the utility. And the payback it gives to them in terms of immediate revenue generation gives up the ability to really price it appropriately and protect ourselves from a future pricing kind of pressure once they're locked in, they're locked in. And we start making really, really attractive margins in the very offset. Mark? Yes. So typically the way these contracts would work is there's going to be depending upon the number of we call them end points, but then the number meters that are being installed. The metrology itself is very profitable. And then as those get installed, you layer on the ongoing monitoring piece of the contract, the data analytics piece of that contract, and the AI wrapped around that. Those are then kind of your SaaS margins that you would expect going forward. And those have a long tail again can be anywhere between 10, 15 years of revenue tied to these. It's a smaller piece of the contract. But even the large piece of the contract, which is meters is very attractive. Yes. I would just punctuate it by saying that, we've \u2013 so the permanent structural savings that, that Sandy alluded to in the prepared remarks, we don't see any give back on that, that's \u2013 that should be locked in for 2021. So again you're talking about roughly $80 million of kind of ongoing savings there. And to Mark's point on the discretionary items, yes, I mean we like pretty much every other company. We started early on the discretionary side. We have $60 million of discretionary savings that are there. How much of that comes back. We're still in the planning process. But as Mark said, we've learned a lot. We've learned how to do a whole lot more with a whole lot less, becoming more efficient, effective, whether it be travel, remote working, making sure that our service providers and suppliers are doing the same thing. So our teams have gone back and renegotiated contracts there. And lastly, making sure that our own approach to work is aligned with what our customers are doing. And they too are \u2013 have pulled back significantly on their own discretionary costs in terms of people working from home, et cetera. So we're still working through that, but we're leaning in in a big way. So I wouldn't expect a lot of that to come back. There will be some, no doubt, because you always have some levels inflation on your wage and salaries, et cetera. We're going to do the right thing by our workforce over time, because we did take some very swift and aggressive actions on our head count during this pandemic. So we're going to remain disciplined and agile and what is otherwise an uncertain environment. Yes, yes. Thank you. Thank you. So again I want to reiterate where I started that is I really hope that all of you and the people close to you are safe and healthy. Make sure you stay such. Really appreciate your continued interest and support. Thanks for joining the call today. And we'll be back in touch soon. Thank you all very much. And we won't speak to many of you at least as a group until after the holidays. So have a very safe and happy holiday season."

            "name": "Mark Rajkowski",
            "content": "Thanks, Patrick. Please turn to Slide 5 and I'll cover our Q3 results in more detail. Revenue declined 7%, which was better than anticipated as we entered the third quarter. We had strong performance in our wastewater utility businesses in the residential end market both of which grew mid-single digits in the quarter. The return to growth in these markets was offset by the expected declines in our metrology project deployments and industrial and commercial businesses, which continue to be impacted by project delays and site restrictions. Geographically, as various countries have reopened and recovered, so has our business. In China for example, we saw very strong performance with double-digit year-over-year growth. Despite the China business returning to pre-pandemic growth rates, emerging markets overall declined 7%. India was down only modestly while the Middle East in Latin America declined double-digits, they continued to be impacted by shutdowns throughout the quarter. Across North America, recovery remains mixed. While revenues improved quarter sequentially, they were down year-over-year. While our wastewater business remained resilient, we continue to see timing effects on metrology deployments and softness in industrial markets. Western Europe grew 2% in the quarter as countries reopened in activity resumed with revenue growing in each of our end markets with the exception of industrial. We also saw operating margins expand quarter sequentially to 13%, which drove EPS of $0.62 both better than expected. I'll cover the margin impacts by segment shortly. Overall, our teams maintained very sharp focus and executed well operationally by driving strong productivity and cost reductions. Please turn to Slide 6 and I'll review third quarter results by segment. Water infrastructure orders declined 5%. Order trends in our wastewater utility businesses continued to be solid. Treatment orders were up 20%. Wastewater transport orders down 9% for the quarter would have been up mid-single digits, but for lapping the large deal we won last year in India. Orders in the industrial end market were soft due to double-digit declines in our de-watering business. Long-term backlog continues to build as we're up over 30% for backlog shippable in 2021 and beyond. Segment revenues declined 2% in the quarter compared to the prior year. This was better than anticipated and reflects the resilience of utility spending to run and maintain their wastewater operations. Our wastewater transport business grew 4% in the quarter. And we saw continued strength in our treatment business, which grew 3% in the quarter. The growth in treatment reflects what has been to date, the relatively uninterrupted deployment of wastewater CapEx projects. The de-watering business experience continued softness. Revenues declined 14%, most of which was in the North American construction and industrial markets, which have seen \u2013 which have been significantly impacted by site closures and access restrictions. Operating margin in the quarter was 18.5% down modestly year-over-year from higher inflation, lower volumes and unfavorable mix. However, the margin performance exceeded our expectations as the team strong execution on cost reductions and productivity initiatives delivered 630 basis points of margin expansion. Now please turn to Slide 7. Orders in the Applied Water segment declined 1% in the quarter and revenues declined 4% as softness in the industrial and commercial markets continued, particularly in the United States and the Middle East. The commercial end market declined 5% in the quarter. As a reminder, this business is roughly two-thirds weighted towards repair and replacement work, which held up relatively well in the quarter despite shutdowns in some regions. Industrial was affected by similar regional dynamics, including site access restrictions and declined 7%. A bright spot in the quarter was residential, which grew 4%. We saw particularly strong growth across Western Europe and from China. Overall, emerging markets declined 8% in the quarter. China had a very strong performance growing 23% as the team executed well, delivering on pent-up demand. This was more than offset by the declines in the Middle East in Latin American regions due to the ongoing lockdowns. Revenue in the United States declined 6%, but improved quarter sequentially with some softness across end markets driven by continued virus impacts. Operating margin in the segment was 15.9%. Volume declines and inflation impacts reduced margins in the quarter, but were largely offset by 530 basis points of cost reduction and productivity benefits. Now please turn to Slide 8. Measurement and control solutions orders declined 19% in the quarter and revenue declined 15%. We saw project timing significantly impact our metrology business. And COVID-19 restrictions push out our project revenues in our pipeline assessment services business. In metrology, we've seen relative stability in our OpEx replacement business from water metrology products. As a reminder, our OpEx exposure accounts for about 70% of our revenues. We've seen much more variability in the 30% of our metrology business that's tied to large project deployments or CapEx, particularly in our gas segment, where project revenues were down 60% in the quarter. Here, we've been significantly impacted by project timing, particularly from lapping a large gas metrology project deployment, which was largely completed at the end of last year and delays in another large gas project this year due to home access restrictions. Despite, these challenges, our underlying North American water metrology book-and-bill business has remained relatively stable and commercial momentum in winning new projects remains robust. This is highlighted by the large contract wins we had in the first half of the year and continued into the third quarter with the Columbus, Ohio and Winston-Salem, North Carolina wins. Patrick already covered Columbus, but I'll quickly highlight a couple of important points on the Winston-Salem win. This is a $60 million contract to provide water metrology products under our network as a service offering, leveraging our FlexNet communications network. Importantly, our teams differentiated the value of our offering by introducing several components from our digital solutions platform, enabling our customer to also seamlessly address critical needs around non-revenue water and their wastewater network. Our pipeline assessment services business has also been subject to significant near-term delays in project revenues, driven by COVID-19 travel restrictions and site closures. As a reminder, there are two businesses within AIA, digital solutions and pipeline assessment services. It's in the latter business, where we've experienced deferrals pipe inspection work. And we expect those push outs to continue into early 2021. As a result, we booked an accounting charge reflect the impacts of those delays. We continue to strongly believe that the medium and long-term value proposition of this business is compelling. Particularly, as utilities move to address budget challenges by using pipeline assessment services to reduce future spend on pipe replacement. We expect the project timing for deploying new metrology projects and the COVID-19 related delays in pipeline assessment services to continue to impact us through the fourth quarter. This is reflected in our fourth quarter guidance, which Sandy will cover later, as shippable backlog for the fourth quarter is down roughly 25%. That said, it's significant that we've not had any project cancellations. Rather, we're seeing an acceleration of growth in our project pipelines and we continue to win large new contracts. As a result MCS shippable backlog in 2021 and beyond is up over 30%, which is a pretty good indication of the power we're seeing with our digital platform. So while these projects aren't currently reflected in the orders metric, they are the latest in a series of important wins that give us confidence in the medium and long-term growth profile of this segment. EBITDA margin in the segment was 14.8%. Year-over-year margin decline was driven by lower revenues of high margin North American metrology and pipeline assessment services, due to project timing and COVID-19. This impact was partially offset by 630 basis points of cost reduction in the quarter. Now please turn to Slide 9 and I'll cover our cash flow performance for the quarter. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.6 billion of cash and short-term investments and $2.4 billion of liquidity driven by a very successful green bond issuance last quarter, combined with our strong cash flow performance throughout the year. In the phase of substantial challenges presented by the pandemic, I'm very proud of the work of our teams in managing all aspects of our working capital performance. At quarter end, working capital was 20.3% of sales, representing an improvement of 30 basis points versus this time last year. The teams focus on working capital, disciplined CapEx spending and cost control through the quarter have continued to pay off, enabling us to generate free cash flow of $234 million. A conversion rate of over 200% in the quarter, which did see some benefit from favorable timing on payments, primarily related to taxes and interest. Before I turn it back over to Patrick, I'd like to take a moment to congratulate Sandy and welcome her as she steps into this new role. Having worked with Sandy previously, I wasn't at all surprised by how quickly she's come up to speed on our businesses in our markets and the pace with which she's developed relationships, all virtually and taken on the leadership of the global finance team over the past month. I couldn't be more confident about the future of Xylem or in Sandy's capability to help Patrick and the team accomplish our mission and take the company's performance to the next level. So with that, I'll hand it back to Patrick for the last time. Yes. Hey, Scott, it's Mark. The price overall for the company in the quarter was 50 \u2013 up 50 basis points, so we continue to drive price. A lot of the inflation has been labor related and we had some very strong price increases over the past 18 months. And some of this is reflective of the demand profile in the market. So we continue to look to drive for price and get value for the products and services that we rendered, but it's \u2013 we're doing it all within the context of the current competitive environment. It's competitive in the rental market for sure. Again, some of that's a function of the demand profile. And but that's not \u2013 it's not the only market. We're seeing it in a number of areas, but our teams are out there being very thoughtful and certainly where there are opportunities to push on price, particularly where we're differentiated they're doing that. Thanks, Dean. Yes, you got cut off there a little bit. You're a little choppy there, but I heard the last part of it [indiscernible] wanted to hear. No. That was on an operational basis. Now are you talking about Q3 or the Q4 outlook? Yes. Yes. And so some of that is just a function of mix, okay, so we're continuing to see impacts in several of our lines of business, whether it's dewatering, whether it's some of the pipeline assessment work or in senses that our metrology deployments that are higher margin that are most impacted from a mixed perspective in the fourth quarter. Yes, same here. Thanks, Nathan. Yes. Hey Ryan, it's Mark. And you're right. That has not been a recent highlight. And but the business has done a really nice job in really upgrading, improving their product sets there. And the \u2013 what we've seen is that as more folks have spent more time at home, working from home. They're spending more money on those homes, including well pumps and other products that, that they need to maintain them. So there's been really strong growth, not just in Europe, but we've seen some pent-up demand in the Asia-Pacific region. And even in the U.S., we're seeing improvements and expect that to continue into the fourth quarter. So it's a function of just one of the impacts of the pandemic, but also importantly some nice improvements that our team has made to our product sets in that area. Hey Joe. Yes, I mean \u2013 and I know you're in a trained accountant by background. So you get all. This is really a function of as Patrick said, a significant temporary delay in the expected revenues to our pipeline assessment services business. So it's more of a push out to the right by a couple of years. And when you look at this business, the margin \u2013 the gross margin profile of that business is greater than 50%. So really rich gross margins. So when those revenues push out, it's \u2013 it has a big impact on the discounted cash flows used is determined the fair value of the business. And you'll also \u2013 when we did our first write down last year about a year ago, you write that down to, you've reset the fair value and that's fair value is based on these future forecasted revenues. So you really don't have a lot of headaches. So when you see a shock like this from the pandemic, it has an impact in terms of the accounting. And as Patrick said long-term \u2013 medium-term, long-term opportunities in this business, we remain very positive. Thanks. Hi Andy. Yes. And this is Mark. And the \u2013 for a couple reasons, one, we'll see some ramping in terms of the structural costs into 2021. Cost savings, yes. And yes, cost savings. And then it's early to call, but when you think about the costs that were going to be coming off and as we move through into 2021, that additional volume will certainly play well relative to the what will then be incrementals. Yes. Thank you. Yes. I mean they're all \u2013 those are \u2013 those recent wins are our water deals and they're very profitable. And the service and software part on top of that makes them even more attractive in their longer-term. Yes. And I'll jump in. And the in terms of both the OpEx and the some of the costs that we've incurred this year, I mean listen, we've learned a lot in terms of working through the pandemic and we're going to be driving hard to keep \u2013 we found ways to keep these costs out, right. And so we'd expect to be able to continue to maintain those efficiencies based on the learning. Secondly, the \u2013 in terms of the support costs in other payments that we've made this year, certainly assuming we move through this, that will be some tailwind as well."

Now, please turn to slide 4 and I will turn the call over to Patrick Decker.\nPatrick Decker: Thanks, Matt. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Let me start by expressing my sincere hope that you and everyone close to you are keeping safe and well. As you've seen from our release this morning, and consistent with our preannouncement two weeks ago, our second quarter performance was better than we had expected. In hindsight, April turned out to be the low point of the quarter. We hope we\u2019ll eventually look back and say, it was a low point for the pandemic. After April, we saw modest improvement in both May and June, as demand began to stabilize in our key markets. Because our business is global, we were exposed to the pandemic effects early, and so we've also benefited from our present with some markets that have already begun to recover. Back in April, it's fair to say that uncertainty overshadows both supply and demand outlooks as COVID spread from Asia to Europe and then North America. So, we felt it responsible to set our second quarter guidance range intentionally wide to bracket a broad set of scenarios for the macro environment. Today, we have far more insight and confidence on the supply side. That's because of one notably positive effect of feeling COVID\u2019s impact early. It catalyzed early action by our teams. Fortunately, we were working from solid financial foundations and a strong position, so we were able to focus on adapting to the uncertainty and managing the things under our control. In addition to addressing the immediate need, those actions have built a more robust foundation for both the medium and long term. I want to make a point of giving credit for my colleagues across Xylem and all of our external partners who made that happen. They've shown incredible resolve and resilience to a time that has put excessive demands on everyone. I want to credit everyone around the world who's kept the water flowing and kept the central services running despite everything being thrown at them. Throughout this period of incredible challenge, they've focused on keeping Xylem safe and serving our communities. Within Xylem, I want to highlight the work of our supply chain, manufacturing, and our distribution team. They've kept our customers supplied and serviced with very few interruptions.  Today, we are up and running across our manufacturing network at greater than 90% availability. So, while demand side uncertainties continue, our outlook now reflects greater clarity and confidence about supply, putting us in a much better position to guide to the third quarter. I also want to recognize the dedication of our commercial teams despite the challenges of working remotely. They drove 10% backlog growth, despite COVID-related macro softness. You will have seen our announced wins in Telangana, India, and with Anglian Water in the U.K. The Telangana irrigation project is our largest win in the country to-date, and we do anticipate it will generate roughly $115 million in revenue over the next two to three years. And our smart networking deployment of the Anglian in the U.K., which combines metrology, communications and digital offerings, is expected to deliver revenues of roughly $90 million over the course of the project. These wins are further evidence of the durability of our business even in challenging times. Because of the differentiation of our portfolio and the resilience of our teams, we expect we will have more news to share about additional big wins when we deliver our third quarter results. Clearly, I'm very pleased that the team's hard work is evidenced both operationally and commercially. Having said that, the outlook for the second half is still not back to normal, therefore, we are not reinstating full year guidance. Conditions are improving in a number of our key markets, but the shape of the COVID curve overall is still unpredictable.  Now, I'd like a hand over to Mark to provide some detail on the second quarter, and then we'll come back to our outlook and the trends we see emerging through this period. Mark, over to you.\nMark Rajkowski: Thanks Patrick. Please turn to Slide 5. Our revenue in the quarter declined 12%, which was better than we anticipated coming out of the first quarter. As Patrick mentioned, our revenue in orders performance improved throughout the quarter with a very strong month in June. Geographically, U.S. revenues declined 15% as our businesses felt the impact of site shutdowns and project deployment delays. Emerging markets were down 15%, driven largely by the lockdowns in the Middle East and India. Notably, China grew 6% in the quarter as the utility end market returned to nearly pre-pandemic levels and industrial and commercial businesses began to modestly recover. Europe was also a relative bright spot for us as revenues declined a modest 3%. Western Europe, which is the majority of our European revenue base, was down mid-single digits. However, our business in Eastern Europe grew double digits. This has been a region we've been very focused on, and I want to highlight the tremendous work our team has done there. They've quietly but consistently delivered a revenue CAGR of mid-teens growth over the last five years. Orders declined 9% in the quarter, while total backlog grew 10% driven by the large signature deals Patrick mentioned earlier. Backlog shippable in 2020 is down 1%. However, backlog shippable after 2020 is up 23%, which gives us confidence that we'll be emerging from 2020 in a position of strength with a solid foundation for growth in 2021 and beyond. Operating margin was 9.3% in the quarter, which I'll review in more detail by segment shortly. Based on our experience in China, we entered the second quarter cautious of COVID potential impacts on our supply chain. However, based on those learnings and the great work of our global supply chain teams, we successfully managed through the COVID challenges and turned those learnings into a competitive advantage. Our teams quickly adapted and began to work in new ways with our customers, our suppliers, and internally, enabling us to deliver earnings per share of $0.40, an achievement punctuated by commercial savvy, operational excellence, cost discipline, and a focus on what really matters. Please turn to Slide 6 and I'll review second quarter results by segment. Water Infrastructure orders grew 7% and total backlog grew 24% in the quarter. This performance was largely driven by the $115 million deal we won in India, which is expected to deliver revenue beginning late this year and over the next three years. Shippable backlog for the remainder of 2020 is up 5%. Segment revenue declined 8% in the quarter and was significantly impacted by declines in the dewatering, industrial, and construction rental business.  As we noted last quarter, we expect utilities to continue to remain resilient as they focus on maintaining a critical infrastructure for wastewater collection and treatment. This was certainly true this past quarter as our wastewater transport business declined only 4%. To date, we've seen wastewater capital projects continue with minimal delays. This was an important driver of the strong quarter from our treatment business, which grew 7%.  While US sales were impacted by double-digit declines in the dewatering business, Western Europe revenues were flat in the quarter, showing resilience and some early signs of recovery especially with our utility customers. As we continue to feel the near-term impacts from COVID-19 across the emerging markets, we remain confident in the long term growth prospects for the water sector. The Chinese and Indian governments, for example, have expressed their ongoing commitment to continued investments in infrastructure for clean drinking water, waste water treatment and environmental protection. Operating margin in the quarter was 16.2%, contracting on lower volumes and unfavorable mix impacts from de-watering, partially offset by productivity, cost savings and price. Now, please turn to Slide 7. The Applied Water segment's orders declined 17% in the quarter, while revenue declined 13%, as site restrictions continue to impact customers across industrial, commercial and residential end markets. As regions begin to reopen, we're seeing modest recovery in our book and ship business in both commercial and industrial markets. We also had a strong quarter in the North American ag business driven by dry weather conditions. Total segment backlog grew 1% in the quarter. Geographically, both the United States and emerging markets revenue declined 14%. However, we saw demand in China begin to recover, growing 2% in the quarter. Industrial and commercial end markets in China have been slower to recover than utilities. And our customers are indicating that it may take several months to fully recover in those end markets. Operating margin in the segment was 13.4%. Margins contracted primarily due to volume declines and inflation, partially offset by 570 basis points of productivity and cost savings as well as 100 basis points of price. Now, please turn to slide 8. Measurement and control solutions orders declined 24% in the quarter, and revenue declined 17%, as the Metrology business slowed due to utility workforce availability and physical distancing requirements, including restrictions on approaching or entering residents homes. This is delaying both project deployments and installations of replacement meters. We expect order and revenue trends to normalize over the coming months, as utility workers are able to safely return to meter replacement and instillation. Importantly, our billing pipeline remained strong, and there have been no project cancellations. Despite the near-term challenges, we're very encouraged by the large win we announced with Anglian Water in the UK. The $90 million contract demonstrates the competitiveness of our AMI and digital solutions to drive key international wins. This win in a robust pipeline of AMI opportunities highlight the continued commercial momentum and the differentiated value our offering bring through our combined digital platform, networking, data analytics and metrology capabilities. Total segment backlog grew 3% year-over-year, with backlog shippable in 2021 and beyond up 12%. Segment margin performance was primarily driven by the impacts from volume declines on neither replacement activity and project deployment delays stemming from COVID-19, while we continue critical investments to support growth. Looking forward, we expect meaningful leverage on the upside as revenue growth drive increased incremental margins from recent large contract wins. With continued commercial momentum and growing project backlogs, our MCS segment will be a significant source of revenue growth and margin expansion for the company in 2021 and beyond. Now, please turn to Slide 9. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.6 billion in cash and total liquidity of roughly $2.4 billion, driven by the $1 billion Green Bond offering we issued in June, as well as strong cash flow performance in the quarter. The Green Bond offering was opportunistic, enabling us to lock in longer maturities at historically low rates, while effectively prefunding $600 million of maturities due in October 2021 at an after-tax cost of less than 1%. This offering was also the latest example of the importance of linking our financing strategy to our sustainability goals. Given the strength of our financial position and liquidity, I'll take a moment to note that our capital allocation strategy remains unchanged. Alongside funding organic investments in key strategic areas, M&A remains a top priority, and we maintain a healthy pipeline of opportunities, which we closely monitor. Now, turning to cash flow. Our performance in the quarter was very strong. Operating cash flow improved roughly 50% year-over-year, and our free cash flow of $137 million more than doubled from the prior year. This was driven by the continued focus and discipline around working capital, the timing of payment on taxes, and the prioritization of our capital spend, which was $44 million in the quarter, down almost 30% from the prior year.  Working capital as a percentage of sales improved 110 basis points year-over-year, as our teams continue to drive hard on collections and payment terms, while managing inventories in a very challenging demand environment. I'm pleased with our overall cash performance to the first half of the year and we now expect free cash flow conversion for this year will be at least 100%.  And with that, I'll hand it back to Patrick.\nPatrick Decker: Thanks Mark. The end market dynamics we anticipate going into the third quarter are consistent with what we saw in Q2. Utilities have remained relatively resilient as expected, however, there is significant divergence between wastewater and clean water. As Mark mentioned, our wastewater business was down only modestly. We're seeing continued OpEx spending to service mission-critical needs and continued execution of capital projects with approved funding. On the clean water side, the short term declines were steeper. They were in the mid-teens. We are seeing some project delays but not cancellations. And we do expect execution to pick back up when physical distancing requirements eased. And we've had some very impressive wins, reflective of healthier long term trends.  There was considerable discussion about the US utilities\u2019 CapEx budgets going into 2021. We do expect modest CapEx softening in the US utilities, but as a leading indicator, we are not seeing a slowdown in our bidding pipeline for capital projects. It is worth noting for a broader context that only 8% of our overall revenue is tied to US utilities\u2019 CapEx. By contrast, OpEx represents 70% of our overall US utilities revenue, and it remains resilient. In addition, we see healthy multi-year trends in both OpEx and CapEx in emerging markets, Europe, and the rest of the world. Turning now to industrial and commercial end markets. Industrial didn't slow as much in the second quarter as originally feared, but it will remain soft while facilities continue to deal with restricted access. Commercial has lagged industrial, and the book and ship business will remain vulnerable in COVID-19 hotspots. Our backlog remains robust. Those distributors who destock in the face of uncertainty are beginning to rebuild their inventory. We see these end market trends fairly consistent across emerging and developing markets. But it's clear that China and Europe are showing more resilience than the US as they emerge sooner from the pandemic. China's recovery, which was up 6% in the second quarter, is a strong indicator. Conversely, as the US is still grappling with the pandemic\u2019s impact, we remain appropriately cautious. Now, please turn ahead to Slide 12. It's worth noting a few trends that we're seeing more broadly across the sector. First, there are some fundamentals that COVID-19 has not changed. The most important is the role that water plays in society. There is perhaps no service more sensible than drinking water and wastewater. As a result, our strategy is as relevant as ever. The global challenges of water scarcity, affordability, and the resilience of our water systems remain front and center. Innovation of all kind is essential now more than ever to addressing those challenges. While the fundamentals are unchanged, other dynamics are accelerating. Interest in digital adoption has clearly gained pace as operators seek a step change in their operational and financial resilience. In a constrained budget environment, they are rethinking how they spend their money. It's become an operational and economic imperative to consider the benefits of remote monitoring, automated operations, and their decision support systems. It is absolutely front of mind for every utility executive I speak with, and we're seeing their interest reflected in accelerated quote activity. We're also seeing a shift in the way that we work with customers every day. The trends are away from face-to-face interaction and more towards virtual customer engagement across cells, commissioning, and servicing. Because of that, we're making changes to reinforce our competitive strength. First, as you know, we took a number of structural cost actions across Xylem during the quarter. Second, we've reprioritized our investments. We're focusing further on the projects that deepen the differentiation and the market leadership of our portfolio, things such as increasing connectivity and interoperability across our solutions. And we continue to invest in our highest-growth geographies.  Lastly, we are reorienting the way that we work within Xylem. We've accelerated deployment of the IP platforms that make remote engagement, different selling, and virtual servicing easier for both our customers and our colleagues. And we are, of course, assessing the permanent changes that we make to travel, facilities, and distance working, changes that no doubt will have a positive impact on cost and productivity and also on employee engagement and morale. We are focused through the pandemic on managing the things that we can control, and we're taking the actions now that will make us even a stronger competitor in both the near and longer term. Now, with that, I'll turn it back over to Mark for more specifics on our Q3 guidance.\nMark Rajkowski: Given the uncertainties related to the reemergence of COVID-19 across parts of the US and other geographies and its potential ramifications for the back half of the year, we're not re-instating full year guidance. However, we do have reasonable visibility through the third quarter which I'll briefly highlight. We expect revenue declines of 8% to 12%, and operating margins in the range of 11% to 11 .5%. This reflects approximately 200 basis points of sequential margin improvement and year-over-year decrementals of approximately 45%. The decremental margins are impacted by continued softness in our high margin de-watering in North American census water businesses, along with a tough prior year compared to last year's third quarter, where we had 90% incremental margins on revenue growth. While we've seen some positive trends in the second quarter, the global economic landscape remains uncertain, and we are, by no means, out of the woods. While Europe is showing positive trends towards recovery, we're closely monitoring the trajectory in the United States. The pandemics impact varies widely across emerging markets, from a return to normalcy in China, to ongoing shutdowns in India, and in parts of Latin America. Lastly, I want to provide a little more clarity on the structural cost the actions we announced in early June. In that announcement, we detailed our plans for permanent actions to simplify our operations and increase our ability to act as one company. These actions help us better serve our customers and afford us long-term financial resilience. This year, we expect to incur $80 million to $100 million in restructuring and realignment charges. This predominantly reflects the actions that we announced in early June, but also some carryover related to prior programs. We've also provided a summary table on the slide which details the total savings we expect to realize in 2020 and 2021 from our announced structural cost programs. As a reminder, that includes savings from restructuring and realignment actions we initiated before this year, as well as savings from actions we announced in June of this year. In total, we expect to realize approximately $70 million in savings this year, and an additional savings of approximately $80 million in 2021. Now, please turn to slide 14. And Patrick will close with some final remarks.\nPatrick Decker: So, before we go to Q&A, there are a few other milestones that deserve a mention. The first, to touch on sustainability, we've released our most recent sustainability report in June, and I'm very proud of the work by the team, and it reflects the impact our colleagues have delivered across the company. It shows how we've delivered on our 2019 goals and establishes comprehensive 2025 targets. It also reinforces the relevance and the value of a strong sustainability approach even in these difficult times. We follow that up with a launch of our green financing framework which underpinned our research $1 billion green bond offering. In addition to showing up our financial strength and liquidity, it extended our commitment that sustainability is at the heart of our business strategy, something we've been doing and will continue to do. We recently announced that Mark will be retiring at the end of the year. I feel confident in saying he will take with him the gratitude of all Xylem stakeholders, but most of all, mine. His impact has been undisputable, and his commitment to both our principles and to delivering value has been constant and unwavering. We have appointed an outstanding CFO to succeed Mark. Sandy Rowland has been CFO of Harman International both while they were publicly traded and since becoming part of Samsung. And that experience has put her right at the intersection of innovation, technology, and disruption. And her board role at Oshkosh make her no stranger to capital goods, manufacturing and muni markets. We look forward to introducing her after she joins us on October 1. Mark is going to be with us through the end of the year, which will ensure an orderly and a smooth transition. And lastly, we also announced today that we've appointed two new members to our board of directors as part of our normal board success and process. The board has appointed Lila Tretikov, who's a Corporate Vice President at Microsoft and a globally renowned technologist. And we look forward to her bringing that perspective to the digital transformation of our sector. Our second board member is Uday Yadav, who's President and COO of Eaton\u2019s electrical sector, and he brings a disciplined global operating perspective to our board. These appointments further deepen our board's diversity, our technology depth, and our global orientation. I'm very pleased that Xylem continues to attract this quality of talent to our purpose and to our mission as a company.  With that, let's open up to questions. And, operator, please lead us into Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets.\nDeane Dray: For Mark, I wish you all the best. And this is your second retirement, do I have that right? Is this going to be your last one?\nMark Rajkowski: That is correct, Deane, on both counts.\nDeane Dray: Okay great. We're definitely going to miss you. \nMark Rajkowski: Thank you.\nPatrick Decker: Absolutely.\nDeane Dray: So first question, so the whole premise of the growth opportunity for Xylem really does hinge on this adoption of digital. And I love seeing this Anglian win that has a digital offering. So you just clarify what part of digital that they're taking? And then Patrick, you've also hinted that - front log of orders also has some digital component to it, and just if you could reflect on where you're seeing traction there.\nPatrick Decker: Sure, yes thanks, Deane. So on the Anglian win, certainly the cornerstone of the deal is the smart network deployment which is really centered around AMI metering deployment. But when you look back and circle, what problem is Anglian and quite frankly other utilities across the UK that we are pursuing right now as part of the AMP7 cycle. Certainly, non-revenue water, and our storm water overflow and overall affordability are three major themes that each one of utility are dealing with. So beyond the AMI metering deployment, there's also a level of data analytics as well as remote monitoring that is built into that project. In terms of the front log, we do have a number of other deals in the pipeline. One that we just recently announced, literally live as we speak as we \u2013we won a large deal just shy of $60 million then a Winston-Salem. And again, that's also a smart networking deployment. So, we feel good again, it's a big market, lots of activity. And I think right now, what I'm most encouraged by is, we're not seeing a slippage or a cancelation of projects as a result of pandemic. If anything, in some areas, it\u2019s being accelerated based upon this need for operational results.\nDeane Dray: Great, and then the second question is on the outlook and the guidance for the third quarter. And I appreciate all the detail on Page 13. If you can just clarify - the notion here is you've got a pretty similar revenue sequential ramp, but you're getting 200 basis points of margin improvement. Is that all the cost saves reading through driving at 200 basis points? So, how much is coming through for the third quarter?\nMark Rajkowski: Yes. Deane, that's exactly what it is. It is, the benefit of - the ramp in some of those restructuring savings in Q3.\nPatrick Decker: And then we also \u2013Deane, hey Deane we didn't guide for obviously, the entire back half of the year. So, we didn't talk about Q4, but we also \u2013we expect even a larger portion of those restructuring savings to roll through in Q4. And then also, we would expect improving mix as we do see, a return to some level of normality within the clean water side of the utility in terms of being able to do meter installs domestically here in the U.S.\nDeane Dray: And just lastly, this doesn't count as a question, but Patrick, I think you undersold Page 12 that picture of the head of your India business that you were there in a hazmat suit. I think you should tell that story. And thank you.\nPatrick Decker: Yes no, I appreciate that, Deane. And yes, Bala is our leader of our business in India. He actually just got recalled promoted to leader of Global Treatment business. And so, that's just one example of many where what our team has gone through to continue serving customers. And obviously, our customers are the ones who keep the resources flowing. So it's a joint effort. But we've had a number of - all these large deals have pretty much been negotiated on Zoom or some remote platform. We've got customer service locations where calls are being moved to people's homes. Again, we're not alone in this. But I do think it's worth calling out that these are not normal times, and our people are really climbing mountains here to contend to deliver. And really, I've never been more proud of them.\nDeane Dray: Thank you.\nPatrick Decker: We had a gentleman sitting in a car for eight hours waiting to get into a building to close the deal, and driving hours back and forth from home to get there so.\nMark Rajkowski: It was a $115 million deal, but it was still a heck of a sacrifice.\nPatrick Decker: Yes.\nOperator: Your next question is from Scott Davis of Melius Research.\nScott Davis: And I'll echo Deane's comments, Mark. Congrats.\nMark Rajkowski: Thank you.\nScott Davis: It was a great run. Sorry to see you go. But...\nMark Rajkowski: It is, it is more to come.\nScott Davis: Enjoy your?\nMark Rajkowski: More to come, Scott.\nScott Davis: But don\u2019t disappear on us. Anyway, I have a couple of questions, if you entertain me a little bit. The first one is just Patrick can you help me understand what a green bond is? I mean, what\u2019s - other than it sounds good, and I know obviously?\nPatrick Decker: Yes.\nScott Davis: Optics matter too, but what does it mean? Let\u2019s leave it at that?\nPatrick Decker: Yes, I'll take it off, and then Mark can go through a little bit more of the granularity. But effectively, it's a financing structure that is tied to certain KPIs that we have to deliver on in order to be able to achieve that financing. And it really is tied to our sustainability goals and metrics as a company. But Mark, do you want to get that.\nMark Rajkowski: That\u2019s right, Patrick, our 2025 goals and the way it works is, as we achieve those goals, we get credit. Those goals are audited, that performance is audited by Sustainalytics. And but it's interesting in addition to the benefit on the rate. What was fascinating was the amount of demand that we got from investors who are focused on sustainable missions. And - the offering was five times oversubscribed, in no small part to the fact that we had almost 50% of those investors as focused on sustainable mission. So, not only do we have an opportunity by executing against our very important sustainability goals to drive the rate down, but it was very helpful from a pricing perspective.\nScott Davis: Okay good color. And then Patrick, you commented on project delays, which I think everybody is seeing. But does that change the economics of the deal for you guys at all I mean, does it make it less attractive? Because you end up perhaps having lots of projects all having to be done at the same time because everybody restarts and - sake of argument January, and you're having to put in a lot of overtime wages. And - I mean how do you cadence that I guess, is another question to ask and not run into having all kinds of project challenges?\nPatrick Decker: Yes and that's predominately Scott, that's predominately a U.S. issue. We've already begun to see - I don't want to call it return to normalcy, but if you follow the as I like to say follow the virus around the world, our businesses have been affected along that same line. So, China, Asia Pac, already seeing good growth, signs of recovery, so that's not creating a pinch in our supply chain as [indiscernible] before we\u2019re back up north of 90% in terms of capacity. Europe is also already, beyond even Eastern Europe. Europe, broadly speaking, is already showing signs of recovery. So, we're kind of working through that demand rebuild as we speak. So, it really is centered around the U.S. It's predominately in the utility space, Scott, because, we've mainly deal through distribution and channel partners on industrial and commercial building. And they certainly, are close to the street. It's mainly and inventory replenishment. And so again, it\u2019s going to be more on our supply chain just to be able to provide that inventory to them than it really - you\u2019re back down to, quite frankly that roughly 8% of our revenue that is U.S. utility CapEx. And that's where you tend to see more of the bigger projects that we focus on. We don't see there being a big pinch in terms of workforce demand. Our people are still very much engaged. Our supply chain is very robust. So, it's a long way of saying we don't really see that being a major concern for ourselves. But I had to go through a bit of deduction Scott, to kind of help you get there on that piece.\nOperator: Your next question is from Scott Graham of Rosenblatt Securities.\nScott Graham: Again and actually, we don't hope to see you again. We hope you're just sort of ride off in the sunset.\nMark Rajkowski: Thank you very much.\nScott Graham: So just a couple of questions here, really regarding the access to sites on the water side. It looks like the access on the water infrastructure side is maybe coming a little bit more easily or just is less intensive than it is on the metering side. The third quarter metering guidance is up I guess a little bit less than what I would have thought. Could you talk about that sort of the intensity around the need to be at the site for that? Thanks.\nPatrick Decker: Yes. It's a good question, Scott. So I think simply put, first of all, for utility, while all these services are essential, I would say that they would all agree that the wastewater side of utility is absolutely mission-critical. They have little choice but to continue keeping those operations running and deployments and expanding, etcetera. Two, I would say in our water infrastructure business and certainly wastewater is much more of a global business today than what we do through M&CS on the clean water side, which is still largely a North America or U.S. centric business. I mean, we're certainly working hard to change that. And obviously, some of these international deals will help in that regard. But I would say it's as much also the geographic focus of our M&CS business. So, you know, on the metering side, those are also critical and they will get done. You know, we're not seeing projects canceled at all. But right now, it really is a matter of site access at the home level as opposed to more of the outdoor and the treatment facilities that we serve on the Water Infrastructure side. But it really is just a - on the clean water side, it really is just the timing and safety dynamic.\nScott Graham: I guess my follow-up question would simply be, you know, in terms of the sales that you're seeing in Water Infrastructure, I know that a lot of that is, you know, to break and fix the OpEx. Is that a higher-margin business whereby two quarters from now, we could be looking at a mix issue or OpEx versus CapEx? Could you talk about the mix - the sales mix in water infrastructure, how that works?\nPatrick Decker: Yes. Scott, roughly 70% of the revenue base is - and this is in the U.S. It's a little bit different as you move around the world. But in the U.S. 70% is OpEx-related, and you're right those - that the margins on that are a little richer for sure. And 30% would be CapEx. In the emerging markets, we have more of a mix towards the CapEx side as we build our position there and build our installed base. So, that continues to be the case. But as we've done that now over the years, we'll begin to see a shift more into the OpEx side. But it is a richer mix of margin.\nMark Rajkowski: Yes. And the margins are typically about 1.5 times the size of a project when you get into, again, installed base in the aftermarket piece.\nScott Graham: And if I can just sneak one last one in here. The [indiscernible] business was actually not as down as I thought it would be. Have you won new placements there? What is the driver?\nPatrick Decker: Yes. it was not as - not as hard hit as we expected, but it was down substantially. I mean, all in, it was close - over 20% down year-over-year. So, we were thinking it might be in the high 20s. So - and it was really, a lot of it was industrial driven, but it was down in most of [technical difficulty].\nMark Rajkowski: Yes. I mean, the good news was backlog was up, hopefully. But, again, the overall revenue was certainly down again considerably in the quarter.\nScott Graham: Yes. But not as good as - not as much as I thought, anyway. But, look, thank you...\nMark Rajkowski: Yes.\nOperator: Our next question is from Ryan Connors of Boenning & Scattergood.\nRyan Connors: So, Patrick, I appreciate your comments on the outlook for the intermediate term outlook for the utility market. But I wanted to probe on that a little bit just from the perspective of the history. So, Xylem wasn't a stand-alone public company when the last recession hit. But if we look at the earnings releases and the transcripts from your former parent and then Xylem later on, you know, we had similar talk about resiliency early on. But then, you know, Xylem was still seeing headwinds in utilities latest 2012, which was a good three, four years removed from the recession. So, I guess my question is, you know, what is it that's really different this time that would cause us to believe that that history is not going to repeat especially when that portfolio at least in Water Infrastructure still is relatively similar to what it looked like then? So, just looking for any kind of tangible thoughts you have on what's different this time?\nPatrick Decker: Sure. So, it's a very relevant question and, obviously, we are not taking anything for granted here. I mean, we're staying close to the markets, and the utility customers are really understanding how they are viewing the world right now from a funding standpoint. I would say a couple of things are different this time. First of all, the percentage of our total revenue that is tied to utilities in the U.S. again is roughly 8% on the CapEx side. And it really is the CapEx piece that is - tends to show that kind of fluctuation from a funding standpoint. Two, you know, we do have the M&CS platform on the clean water side. So, while we are absorbing some of those delays right now clearly. We're not seeing cancelations there. These are projects that are tied to issues of affordability, non-revenue water. And certainly, what we're hearing from utility leaders is that they don't see those projects being canceled, you know, or killed in any way. So, that's a different dynamic than we would have had back at the time in 2011 and 2012. Lastly, I would say it goes back to that overall percentage of revenue even tied to U.S. CapEx, is we've also got a much larger portion of our revenue today in emerging markets. And we see that demand continuing to increase considerably.\nRyan Connors: Okay. That's very helpful. And then related follow-up is so much right now seems to ride on the federal government across the economy. And I guess for Xylem, I wonder if you can comment on how you - that outlook you just described in utility, I mean how that differs under a scenario where Congress does bail out state or local governments versus a more laissez faire scenario where things are just sort of left to run their course and maybe you get some greater budget cuts? How do you handicap that and how does your outlook differ in those two scenarios?\nPatrick Decker: Sure. So I - it\u2019s a great question. I think certainly as we've mentioned before, and I don't think our view on that has changed, is we certainly are not counting or riding on any kind of federal bailout or federal funding along the way. As you well know, Ryan, the water sector generally speaking the U.S. has never really relied heavily on federal funding. It's always been at the state and local level. So any move there on the positive from the federal government would certainly be upside. But I wouldn't bake that into people's outlooks or forecast for the business because it'll be a while in the coming. But likewise, there's really no downside in that regard. Now, obviously, we're staying close to the law of utilities and munis to understand those parts of the country that are feeling more stressed at this point in time, but I would say we're kind of neutral on the whole federal funding aspect.\nOperator: Your next question is from Andy Kaplowitz of Citigroup.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Just focusing on the cadence that you saw on Q2, because you didn't mention a very strong June. So can you elaborate on that in terms of the growth you saw as the quarter developed? And then, what are you seeing in July, especially considering, you know, you did mention that you're not receiving guidance given the recent resurgence in infections in the U.S.?\nMark Rajkowski: Sure. Andy, yes. The - you know, we started off the quarter down mid-single digits. And yes, its mid-single digits - I wish it was mid-single digits. Mid-teens. Matt is like flashing me, no. Mid-single digits. But, - and that was true for got a little bit better in May and then we had a really strong June. So, we ended up down low-double digits 12%. And as we mentioned, orders were still in the quarter down 9%. July, we're seeing some modest improvement, and that's encouraging. But, you know, as we look at the Q3 outlook, you know, the fact is we're - you know, shippable backlog for the quarter is less than 2%. And so, we're still going to need a strong, you know, orders performance in the next two months. And we think, all in, we're well aligned with - you know, with what we laid out in terms of the range, which obviously is tighter than we had last quarter because we have better \u2013 you know, some better visibility.\nAndy Kaplowitz: That\u2019s helpful, Mark. And I think in June when you announced sort of the bigger structural cost, you also talked about spending $40 million to $50 million to exit certain business activities. I think they seem to be focused on M&CS as that\u2019s where it seems like you\u2019re taking the bulk of your restructuring. So, could you just elaborate on what you\u2019re now there, what you\u2019re getting out of and why?\nMark Rajkowski: Yeah. And it\u2019s - and I think the numbers, it's not quite that large. It's probably in the 20s, and it's a number of smaller lines of business and just those that aren't as profitable nor it is core to our mission moving forward.\nPatrick Decker: Yes. There's nothing - there was nothing in there that was strategic in terms of we\u2019re deciding to exit something from a material perspective, we wouldn't have even called them out if it weren't for the fact that it did contribute to some of the cost action or the costs being taken. Therefore, we had to disclose that. But again, the amount of revenue is a rounding error. Yeah.\nOperator: Your next question is from Joe Giordano of Cowen.\nJoe Giordano: Just to start here, can we - Patrick, I know that the situation can change dramatically between now and obviously 2021. But just given where we're at right now with the macro and your view on developed market utilities, is like, the appropriate kind of benchmark for now to be, like, hopefully, overall budgets are kind of flattish, maybe CapEx is pressured and maybe OpEx is kind of stable but, like, with lower tax receipts we're kind of hoping for flat overall spending environment and utilities? Is that, like, a fair benchmark right now?\nPatrick Decker: I think Joe, it's too early to tell. I think there is still a lot of uncertainty there. I mean, we're encouraged by the bidding pipeline. We're encouraged by lack of project cancellations. But I really wouldn't want to start guessing what overall muni budgets are going to be. Again, I go back to what portion of our total revenue that represents in the U.S. and the fact that we are already seeing some emerging strength in other parts of the globe. I think it's also - the focus we have right now with our teams is - this pandemic is clearly highlighted for the utilities, the need for greater operational resilience. And obviously, we're certainly learning a bit about the financial resilience, but we are really focusing in on, with the utilities, on helping them do more with a whole lot less. And so, that's where they are looking for alternative solutions, the whole digital dimension of things. And that's - really where we have our teams focused in taking share. Obviously, at the same time, I think it's important that everyone on this call understand that, I think what we're also seeing in our portfolio, and this goes back to maybe with the questions earlier around what's different this time versus before, it really speaks to the durability and critical nature of our traditional heritage product lines. That, we don't talk as much about over the last year or so because of the acquisitions we've done. But they are absolutely core right now and essential to what the utilities need.\nJoe Giordano: And a couple of just related ones on MCS, well just one, are you confident that as in like the market deterioration we\u2019re done with negative margins here? And then two, you guys have done a lot over the last several years building out portfolio. It's an interesting mix of applications there. There's been some issues, some Xylem issues, some market issues, but like, curious what you learned from this whole experience of building this out and how you feel about whether that business is ready for M&A incremental from here?\nMark Rajkowski: Yes so, I would say that the - your question of margins, we certainly expect to be, in the black and see positive margins. We\u2019d expect second quarter to - the third quarter to be positive. We were just about, breakeven in Q2. So, with a little bit of a ramp in terms of some of the deployments, the installations and just cross actions, we're going to see improvement there. I think Patrick I'm sure out use that. I think in terms of lessons learned, I think the - what we've learned is, adoption of some of these new technologies is a little bit more challenging particularly in the developed markets. But I think in terms of the capabilities that we've built particularly what we're seeing through this pandemic in the discussions that we're having with customers. I think we're - very pleased with what we have done, the acquisitions we've made, and the capabilities we've built, you know, as we emerge from the pandemic - is that is going to provide us we believe, with a competitive advantage.\nPatrick Decker: Yes so, real quick Joe, on the - I'll touch on both as well. On the margin comments or question, there, I think it's important that all understand the level of fixed cost base that we have within M&CS given the services profile in terms of the R&D investments and building out new partner development rollout et cetera. And so some of the restructuring actions we've taken do get at that overhead cost base And so, but our view on incremental rate is unchanged, very attractive incremental in that business. And so, as we see projects being deployed, return to work in the second half of the year, we would expect the incremental to be quite attractive in that business so no change in view there. On the lessons learned, I would also just throw in Joe, that I think that it does speak to adoption, but I think it's also the fact that the solutions and value proposition that we're bringing to the sector are disruptive. And any time that you are aiming to disrupt [technical difficulty] it's going to take longer than what anybody ever wanted to. It's always going to be a bit harder than what versus [technical difficulty]. But our views around the attractiveness and the need for the sector to get disrupted in a positive way, especially around the idea of making infrastructure more affordable, that issue remains unchanged. And so it's not going anywhere. And so, I think we want to be appropriately impatient in this regard. But we've got to keep in perspective as to the long-term journey that we're on here.\nOperator: Your next question is from Nathan Jones with Stifel.\nNathan Jones: Congratulations Mark and Patrick, if you need somebody to wait in a car for eight hours for $115 million I\u2019m available. I wanted to go back to the utility funding question here. So a lot of the utility leaders that we've talked to are far less focused on state and local government funding and much more focused on the ability to collect water rates, which as I understand it is a much bigger part of the funding equation for U.S. utilities anyway. And they're concerned about things like people not going into city going to work. We'll reduce the water consumption there? So places like D.C. or New York City are the areas where those water rates are going to be collected less and those budgets are going to be a little more challenged. So, I wonder if you could comment on that angle of it. I think people are a little bit too focused on state and local government and not focused enough on water rates. And then, could you contrast that with how utilities are funded outside of the U.S. versus inside the U.S.?\nPatrick Decker: Yes so no I think you've hit it, Nate on the U.S. side. You're absolutely right. The biggest concern that the utility leaders have at this point in time, especially on the clean water side of the equation, is again their revenue sources in terms of rate cases, rate collection, et cetera. So I don't really have much to offer there other than again, it is a concern of theirs. They do look back at previous cycles and try to understand. It is a different dynamic now. And they're trying to get their hands around. Now, they're also letting me know that they're seeing increased consumption at the household level because people are staying home. So, some of that\u2019s just jumped from one, kind of metering point to another. But I don't want to minimize that in terms that there will be some potential impact there. They are still generally speaking from the utility leaders that we\u2019re engaging with. They're still pretty confident around their ability to weather this. And it really is a matter of getting through the second half of this year. I think we'll learn a lot more as they go through their budget approvals and that's not all. It's not all calendar as you know a lot of those are July 1, October 1, kind of fiscal budgets. And so we're keeping a very close eye on that, but again I want to keep it in perspective as to what percentage of our total revenue that represents across the company. Outside of the U.S. it tends to be and we saw this in the last downturn. It tends to be much more stable. And that's because a large majority of the funding certainly in emerging markets is at a federal or state level. I mean, it is much more of a kind of independent funding and much more - much less reliant on, the actual revenue collection.\nNathan Jones: Yes I think it's an important point that outside of the U.S. tends to be much more stable on the collection side. You guys have said in the last call that, a more normalized decremental level would be 35%, but you probably wouldn't say that until the second half of the year. Is that still the target that we should be thinking about for the fourth quarter?\nMark Rajkowski: Yes, Nate absolutely - a couple of reasons. One, we're going to see a bigger ramp as Patrick mentioned earlier, in terms of our cost savings. And then secondly, we had some items that made to compare - some items last year that made to compare this year tougher so.\nNathan Jones: For Q2?\nPatrick Decker: Yes, for Q2 and Q3.\nMark Rajkowski: Yes so, we do expect to see that normalize in the fourth quarter.\nOperator: Thank you. We have reached our allotted time for questions. I will now turn the call back to Patrick Decker for any additional or closing remarks.\nPatrick Decker: Well again, thanks, everybody, for your interest and for your support. Really appreciate it. Again, I want everybody to stay safe. Stay strong. Have a great end to your summer, and we'll be back with you on our next earnings call. Thank you, all very much.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude today's Xylem\u2019s second quarter 2020 earnings conference call. Please disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Patrick Decker",
            "content": "Thanks, Matt. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Let me start by expressing my sincere hope that you and everyone close to you are keeping safe and well. As you've seen from our release this morning, and consistent with our preannouncement two weeks ago, our second quarter performance was better than we had expected. In hindsight, April turned out to be the low point of the quarter. We hope we'll eventually look back and say, it was a low point for the pandemic. After April, we saw modest improvement in both May and June, as demand began to stabilize in our key markets. Because our business is global, we were exposed to the pandemic effects early, and so we've also benefited from our present with some markets that have already begun to recover. Back in April, it's fair to say that uncertainty overshadows both supply and demand outlooks as COVID spread from Asia to Europe and then North America. So, we felt it responsible to set our second quarter guidance range intentionally wide to bracket a broad set of scenarios for the macro environment. Today, we have far more insight and confidence on the supply side. That's because of one notably positive effect of feeling COVID's impact early. It catalyzed early action by our teams. Fortunately, we were working from solid financial foundations and a strong position, so we were able to focus on adapting to the uncertainty and managing the things under our control. In addition to addressing the immediate need, those actions have built a more robust foundation for both the medium and long term. I want to make a point of giving credit for my colleagues across Xylem and all of our external partners who made that happen. They've shown incredible resolve and resilience to a time that has put excessive demands on everyone. I want to credit everyone around the world who's kept the water flowing and kept the central services running despite everything being thrown at them. Throughout this period of incredible challenge, they've focused on keeping Xylem safe and serving our communities. Within Xylem, I want to highlight the work of our supply chain, manufacturing, and our distribution team. They've kept our customers supplied and serviced with very few interruptions.  Today, we are up and running across our manufacturing network at greater than 90% availability. So, while demand side uncertainties continue, our outlook now reflects greater clarity and confidence about supply, putting us in a much better position to guide to the third quarter. I also want to recognize the dedication of our commercial teams despite the challenges of working remotely. They drove 10% backlog growth, despite COVID-related macro softness. You will have seen our announced wins in Telangana, India, and with Anglian Water in the U.K. The Telangana irrigation project is our largest win in the country to-date, and we do anticipate it will generate roughly $115 million in revenue over the next two to three years. And our smart networking deployment of the Anglian in the U.K., which combines metrology, communications and digital offerings, is expected to deliver revenues of roughly $90 million over the course of the project. These wins are further evidence of the durability of our business even in challenging times. Because of the differentiation of our portfolio and the resilience of our teams, we expect we will have more news to share about additional big wins when we deliver our third quarter results. Clearly, I'm very pleased that the team's hard work is evidenced both operationally and commercially. Having said that, the outlook for the second half is still not back to normal, therefore, we are not reinstating full year guidance. Conditions are improving in a number of our key markets, but the shape of the COVID curve overall is still unpredictable.  Now, I'd like a hand over to Mark to provide some detail on the second quarter, and then we'll come back to our outlook and the trends we see emerging through this period. Mark, over to you. Thanks Mark. The end market dynamics we anticipate going into the third quarter are consistent with what we saw in Q2. Utilities have remained relatively resilient as expected, however, there is significant divergence between wastewater and clean water. As Mark mentioned, our wastewater business was down only modestly. We're seeing continued OpEx spending to service mission-critical needs and continued execution of capital projects with approved funding. On the clean water side, the short term declines were steeper. They were in the mid-teens. We are seeing some project delays but not cancellations. And we do expect execution to pick back up when physical distancing requirements eased. And we've had some very impressive wins, reflective of healthier long term trends.  There was considerable discussion about the US utilities' CapEx budgets going into 2021. We do expect modest CapEx softening in the US utilities, but as a leading indicator, we are not seeing a slowdown in our bidding pipeline for capital projects. It is worth noting for a broader context that only 8% of our overall revenue is tied to US utilities' CapEx. By contrast, OpEx represents 70% of our overall US utilities revenue, and it remains resilient. In addition, we see healthy multi-year trends in both OpEx and CapEx in emerging markets, Europe, and the rest of the world. Turning now to industrial and commercial end markets. Industrial didn't slow as much in the second quarter as originally feared, but it will remain soft while facilities continue to deal with restricted access. Commercial has lagged industrial, and the book and ship business will remain vulnerable in COVID-19 hotspots. Our backlog remains robust. Those distributors who destock in the face of uncertainty are beginning to rebuild their inventory. We see these end market trends fairly consistent across emerging and developing markets. But it's clear that China and Europe are showing more resilience than the US as they emerge sooner from the pandemic. China's recovery, which was up 6% in the second quarter, is a strong indicator. Conversely, as the US is still grappling with the pandemic's impact, we remain appropriately cautious. Now, please turn ahead to Slide 12. It's worth noting a few trends that we're seeing more broadly across the sector. First, there are some fundamentals that COVID-19 has not changed. The most important is the role that water plays in society. There is perhaps no service more sensible than drinking water and wastewater. As a result, our strategy is as relevant as ever. The global challenges of water scarcity, affordability, and the resilience of our water systems remain front and center. Innovation of all kind is essential now more than ever to addressing those challenges. While the fundamentals are unchanged, other dynamics are accelerating. Interest in digital adoption has clearly gained pace as operators seek a step change in their operational and financial resilience. In a constrained budget environment, they are rethinking how they spend their money. It's become an operational and economic imperative to consider the benefits of remote monitoring, automated operations, and their decision support systems. It is absolutely front of mind for every utility executive I speak with, and we're seeing their interest reflected in accelerated quote activity. We're also seeing a shift in the way that we work with customers every day. The trends are away from face-to-face interaction and more towards virtual customer engagement across cells, commissioning, and servicing. Because of that, we're making changes to reinforce our competitive strength. First, as you know, we took a number of structural cost actions across Xylem during the quarter. Second, we've reprioritized our investments. We're focusing further on the projects that deepen the differentiation and the market leadership of our portfolio, things such as increasing connectivity and interoperability across our solutions. And we continue to invest in our highest-growth geographies.  Lastly, we are reorienting the way that we work within Xylem. We've accelerated deployment of the IP platforms that make remote engagement, different selling, and virtual servicing easier for both our customers and our colleagues. And we are, of course, assessing the permanent changes that we make to travel, facilities, and distance working, changes that no doubt will have a positive impact on cost and productivity and also on employee engagement and morale. We are focused through the pandemic on managing the things that we can control, and we're taking the actions now that will make us even a stronger competitor in both the near and longer term. Now, with that, I'll turn it back over to Mark for more specifics on our Q3 guidance. So, before we go to Q&A, there are a few other milestones that deserve a mention. The first, to touch on sustainability, we've released our most recent sustainability report in June, and I'm very proud of the work by the team, and it reflects the impact our colleagues have delivered across the company. It shows how we've delivered on our 2019 goals and establishes comprehensive 2025 targets. It also reinforces the relevance and the value of a strong sustainability approach even in these difficult times. We follow that up with a launch of our green financing framework which underpinned our research $1 billion green bond offering. In addition to showing up our financial strength and liquidity, it extended our commitment that sustainability is at the heart of our business strategy, something we've been doing and will continue to do. We recently announced that Mark will be retiring at the end of the year. I feel confident in saying he will take with him the gratitude of all Xylem stakeholders, but most of all, mine. His impact has been undisputable, and his commitment to both our principles and to delivering value has been constant and unwavering. We have appointed an outstanding CFO to succeed Mark. Sandy Rowland has been CFO of Harman International both while they were publicly traded and since becoming part of Samsung. And that experience has put her right at the intersection of innovation, technology, and disruption. And her board role at Oshkosh make her no stranger to capital goods, manufacturing and muni markets. We look forward to introducing her after she joins us on October 1. Mark is going to be with us through the end of the year, which will ensure an orderly and a smooth transition. And lastly, we also announced today that we've appointed two new members to our board of directors as part of our normal board success and process. The board has appointed Lila Tretikov, who's a Corporate Vice President at Microsoft and a globally renowned technologist. And we look forward to her bringing that perspective to the digital transformation of our sector. Our second board member is Uday Yadav, who's President and COO of Eaton's electrical sector, and he brings a disciplined global operating perspective to our board. These appointments further deepen our board's diversity, our technology depth, and our global orientation. I'm very pleased that Xylem continues to attract this quality of talent to our purpose and to our mission as a company.  With that, let's open up to questions. And, operator, please lead us into Q&A. Absolutely. Sure, yes thanks, Deane. So on the Anglian win, certainly the cornerstone of the deal is the smart network deployment which is really centered around AMI metering deployment. But when you look back and circle, what problem is Anglian and quite frankly other utilities across the UK that we are pursuing right now as part of the AMP7 cycle. Certainly, non-revenue water, and our storm water overflow and overall affordability are three major themes that each one of utility are dealing with. So beyond the AMI metering deployment, there's also a level of data analytics as well as remote monitoring that is built into that project. In terms of the front log, we do have a number of other deals in the pipeline. One that we just recently announced, literally live as we speak as we \u2013we won a large deal just shy of $60 million then a Winston-Salem. And again, that's also a smart networking deployment. So, we feel good again, it's a big market, lots of activity. And I think right now, what I'm most encouraged by is, we're not seeing a slippage or a cancelation of projects as a result of pandemic. If anything, in some areas, it's being accelerated based upon this need for operational results. And then we also \u2013Deane, hey Deane we didn't guide for obviously, the entire back half of the year. So, we didn't talk about Q4, but we also \u2013we expect even a larger portion of those restructuring savings to roll through in Q4. And then also, we would expect improving mix as we do see, a return to some level of normality within the clean water side of the utility in terms of being able to do meter installs domestically here in the U.S. Yes no, I appreciate that, Deane. And yes, Bala is our leader of our business in India. He actually just got recalled promoted to leader of Global Treatment business. And so, that's just one example of many where what our team has gone through to continue serving customers. And obviously, our customers are the ones who keep the resources flowing. So it's a joint effort. But we've had a number of - all these large deals have pretty much been negotiated on Zoom or some remote platform. We've got customer service locations where calls are being moved to people's homes. Again, we're not alone in this. But I do think it's worth calling out that these are not normal times, and our people are really climbing mountains here to contend to deliver. And really, I've never been more proud of them. We had a gentleman sitting in a car for eight hours waiting to get into a building to close the deal, and driving hours back and forth from home to get there so. Yes. Yes. Yes, I'll take it off, and then Mark can go through a little bit more of the granularity. But effectively, it's a financing structure that is tied to certain KPIs that we have to deliver on in order to be able to achieve that financing. And it really is tied to our sustainability goals and metrics as a company. But Mark, do you want to get that. Yes and that's predominately Scott, that's predominately a U.S. issue. We've already begun to see - I don't want to call it return to normalcy, but if you follow the as I like to say follow the virus around the world, our businesses have been affected along that same line. So, China, Asia Pac, already seeing good growth, signs of recovery, so that's not creating a pinch in our supply chain as [indiscernible] before we're back up north of 90% in terms of capacity. Europe is also already, beyond even Eastern Europe. Europe, broadly speaking, is already showing signs of recovery. So, we're kind of working through that demand rebuild as we speak. So, it really is centered around the U.S. It's predominately in the utility space, Scott, because, we've mainly deal through distribution and channel partners on industrial and commercial building. And they certainly, are close to the street. It's mainly and inventory replenishment. And so again, it's going to be more on our supply chain just to be able to provide that inventory to them than it really - you're back down to, quite frankly that roughly 8% of our revenue that is U.S. utility CapEx. And that's where you tend to see more of the bigger projects that we focus on. We don't see there being a big pinch in terms of workforce demand. Our people are still very much engaged. Our supply chain is very robust. So, it's a long way of saying we don't really see that being a major concern for ourselves. But I had to go through a bit of deduction Scott, to kind of help you get there on that piece. Yes. It's a good question, Scott. So I think simply put, first of all, for utility, while all these services are essential, I would say that they would all agree that the wastewater side of utility is absolutely mission-critical. They have little choice but to continue keeping those operations running and deployments and expanding, etcetera. Two, I would say in our water infrastructure business and certainly wastewater is much more of a global business today than what we do through M&CS on the clean water side, which is still largely a North America or U.S. centric business. I mean, we're certainly working hard to change that. And obviously, some of these international deals will help in that regard. But I would say it's as much also the geographic focus of our M&CS business. So, you know, on the metering side, those are also critical and they will get done. You know, we're not seeing projects canceled at all. But right now, it really is a matter of site access at the home level as opposed to more of the outdoor and the treatment facilities that we serve on the Water Infrastructure side. But it really is just a - on the clean water side, it really is just the timing and safety dynamic. Yes. Scott, roughly 70% of the revenue base is - and this is in the U.S. It's a little bit different as you move around the world. But in the U.S. 70% is OpEx-related, and you're right those - that the margins on that are a little richer for sure. And 30% would be CapEx. In the emerging markets, we have more of a mix towards the CapEx side as we build our position there and build our installed base. So, that continues to be the case. But as we've done that now over the years, we'll begin to see a shift more into the OpEx side. But it is a richer mix of margin. Yes. it was not as - not as hard hit as we expected, but it was down substantially. I mean, all in, it was close - over 20% down year-over-year. So, we were thinking it might be in the high 20s. So - and it was really, a lot of it was industrial driven, but it was down in most of [technical difficulty]. Sure. So, it's a very relevant question and, obviously, we are not taking anything for granted here. I mean, we're staying close to the markets, and the utility customers are really understanding how they are viewing the world right now from a funding standpoint. I would say a couple of things are different this time. First of all, the percentage of our total revenue that is tied to utilities in the U.S. again is roughly 8% on the CapEx side. And it really is the CapEx piece that is - tends to show that kind of fluctuation from a funding standpoint. Two, you know, we do have the M&CS platform on the clean water side. So, while we are absorbing some of those delays right now clearly. We're not seeing cancelations there. These are projects that are tied to issues of affordability, non-revenue water. And certainly, what we're hearing from utility leaders is that they don't see those projects being canceled, you know, or killed in any way. So, that's a different dynamic than we would have had back at the time in 2011 and 2012. Lastly, I would say it goes back to that overall percentage of revenue even tied to U.S. CapEx, is we've also got a much larger portion of our revenue today in emerging markets. And we see that demand continuing to increase considerably. Sure. So I - it's a great question. I think certainly as we've mentioned before, and I don't think our view on that has changed, is we certainly are not counting or riding on any kind of federal bailout or federal funding along the way. As you well know, Ryan, the water sector generally speaking the U.S. has never really relied heavily on federal funding. It's always been at the state and local level. So any move there on the positive from the federal government would certainly be upside. But I wouldn't bake that into people's outlooks or forecast for the business because it'll be a while in the coming. But likewise, there's really no downside in that regard. Now, obviously, we're staying close to the law of utilities and munis to understand those parts of the country that are feeling more stressed at this point in time, but I would say we're kind of neutral on the whole federal funding aspect. Yes. There's nothing - there was nothing in there that was strategic in terms of we're deciding to exit something from a material perspective, we wouldn't have even called them out if it weren't for the fact that it did contribute to some of the cost action or the costs being taken. Therefore, we had to disclose that. But again, the amount of revenue is a rounding error. Yeah. I think Joe, it's too early to tell. I think there is still a lot of uncertainty there. I mean, we're encouraged by the bidding pipeline. We're encouraged by lack of project cancellations. But I really wouldn't want to start guessing what overall muni budgets are going to be. Again, I go back to what portion of our total revenue that represents in the U.S. and the fact that we are already seeing some emerging strength in other parts of the globe. I think it's also - the focus we have right now with our teams is - this pandemic is clearly highlighted for the utilities, the need for greater operational resilience. And obviously, we're certainly learning a bit about the financial resilience, but we are really focusing in on, with the utilities, on helping them do more with a whole lot less. And so, that's where they are looking for alternative solutions, the whole digital dimension of things. And that's - really where we have our teams focused in taking share. Obviously, at the same time, I think it's important that everyone on this call understand that, I think what we're also seeing in our portfolio, and this goes back to maybe with the questions earlier around what's different this time versus before, it really speaks to the durability and critical nature of our traditional heritage product lines. That, we don't talk as much about over the last year or so because of the acquisitions we've done. But they are absolutely core right now and essential to what the utilities need. Yes so, real quick Joe, on the - I'll touch on both as well. On the margin comments or question, there, I think it's important that all understand the level of fixed cost base that we have within M&CS given the services profile in terms of the R&D investments and building out new partner development rollout et cetera. And so some of the restructuring actions we've taken do get at that overhead cost base And so, but our view on incremental rate is unchanged, very attractive incremental in that business. And so, as we see projects being deployed, return to work in the second half of the year, we would expect the incremental to be quite attractive in that business so no change in view there. On the lessons learned, I would also just throw in Joe, that I think that it does speak to adoption, but I think it's also the fact that the solutions and value proposition that we're bringing to the sector are disruptive. And any time that you are aiming to disrupt [technical difficulty] it's going to take longer than what anybody ever wanted to. It's always going to be a bit harder than what versus [technical difficulty]. But our views around the attractiveness and the need for the sector to get disrupted in a positive way, especially around the idea of making infrastructure more affordable, that issue remains unchanged. And so it's not going anywhere. And so, I think we want to be appropriately impatient in this regard. But we've got to keep in perspective as to the long-term journey that we're on here. Yes so no I think you've hit it, Nate on the U.S. side. You're absolutely right. The biggest concern that the utility leaders have at this point in time, especially on the clean water side of the equation, is again their revenue sources in terms of rate cases, rate collection, et cetera. So I don't really have much to offer there other than again, it is a concern of theirs. They do look back at previous cycles and try to understand. It is a different dynamic now. And they're trying to get their hands around. Now, they're also letting me know that they're seeing increased consumption at the household level because people are staying home. So, some of that's just jumped from one, kind of metering point to another. But I don't want to minimize that in terms that there will be some potential impact there. They are still generally speaking from the utility leaders that we're engaging with. They're still pretty confident around their ability to weather this. And it really is a matter of getting through the second half of this year. I think we'll learn a lot more as they go through their budget approvals and that's not all. It's not all calendar as you know a lot of those are July 1, October 1, kind of fiscal budgets. And so we're keeping a very close eye on that, but again I want to keep it in perspective as to what percentage of our total revenue that represents across the company. Outside of the U.S. it tends to be and we saw this in the last downturn. It tends to be much more stable. And that's because a large majority of the funding certainly in emerging markets is at a federal or state level. I mean, it is much more of a kind of independent funding and much more - much less reliant on, the actual revenue collection. Yes, for Q2 and Q3. Well again, thanks, everybody, for your interest and for your support. Really appreciate it. Again, I want everybody to stay safe. Stay strong. Have a great end to your summer, and we'll be back with you on our next earnings call. Thank you, all very much."

            "content": "Thanks Patrick. Please turn to Slide 5. Our revenue in the quarter declined 12%, which was better than we anticipated coming out of the first quarter. As Patrick mentioned, our revenue in orders performance improved throughout the quarter with a very strong month in June. Geographically, U.S. revenues declined 15% as our businesses felt the impact of site shutdowns and project deployment delays. Emerging markets were down 15%, driven largely by the lockdowns in the Middle East and India. Notably, China grew 6% in the quarter as the utility end market returned to nearly pre-pandemic levels and industrial and commercial businesses began to modestly recover. Europe was also a relative bright spot for us as revenues declined a modest 3%. Western Europe, which is the majority of our European revenue base, was down mid-single digits. However, our business in Eastern Europe grew double digits. This has been a region we've been very focused on, and I want to highlight the tremendous work our team has done there. They've quietly but consistently delivered a revenue CAGR of mid-teens growth over the last five years. Orders declined 9% in the quarter, while total backlog grew 10% driven by the large signature deals Patrick mentioned earlier. Backlog shippable in 2020 is down 1%. However, backlog shippable after 2020 is up 23%, which gives us confidence that we'll be emerging from 2020 in a position of strength with a solid foundation for growth in 2021 and beyond. Operating margin was 9.3% in the quarter, which I'll review in more detail by segment shortly. Based on our experience in China, we entered the second quarter cautious of COVID potential impacts on our supply chain. However, based on those learnings and the great work of our global supply chain teams, we successfully managed through the COVID challenges and turned those learnings into a competitive advantage. Our teams quickly adapted and began to work in new ways with our customers, our suppliers, and internally, enabling us to deliver earnings per share of $0.40, an achievement punctuated by commercial savvy, operational excellence, cost discipline, and a focus on what really matters. Please turn to Slide 6 and I'll review second quarter results by segment. Water Infrastructure orders grew 7% and total backlog grew 24% in the quarter. This performance was largely driven by the $115 million deal we won in India, which is expected to deliver revenue beginning late this year and over the next three years. Shippable backlog for the remainder of 2020 is up 5%. Segment revenue declined 8% in the quarter and was significantly impacted by declines in the dewatering, industrial, and construction rental business.  As we noted last quarter, we expect utilities to continue to remain resilient as they focus on maintaining a critical infrastructure for wastewater collection and treatment. This was certainly true this past quarter as our wastewater transport business declined only 4%. To date, we've seen wastewater capital projects continue with minimal delays. This was an important driver of the strong quarter from our treatment business, which grew 7%.  While US sales were impacted by double-digit declines in the dewatering business, Western Europe revenues were flat in the quarter, showing resilience and some early signs of recovery especially with our utility customers. As we continue to feel the near-term impacts from COVID-19 across the emerging markets, we remain confident in the long term growth prospects for the water sector. The Chinese and Indian governments, for example, have expressed their ongoing commitment to continued investments in infrastructure for clean drinking water, waste water treatment and environmental protection. Operating margin in the quarter was 16.2%, contracting on lower volumes and unfavorable mix impacts from de-watering, partially offset by productivity, cost savings and price. Now, please turn to Slide 7. The Applied Water segment's orders declined 17% in the quarter, while revenue declined 13%, as site restrictions continue to impact customers across industrial, commercial and residential end markets. As regions begin to reopen, we're seeing modest recovery in our book and ship business in both commercial and industrial markets. We also had a strong quarter in the North American ag business driven by dry weather conditions. Total segment backlog grew 1% in the quarter. Geographically, both the United States and emerging markets revenue declined 14%. However, we saw demand in China begin to recover, growing 2% in the quarter. Industrial and commercial end markets in China have been slower to recover than utilities. And our customers are indicating that it may take several months to fully recover in those end markets. Operating margin in the segment was 13.4%. Margins contracted primarily due to volume declines and inflation, partially offset by 570 basis points of productivity and cost savings as well as 100 basis points of price. Now, please turn to slide 8. Measurement and control solutions orders declined 24% in the quarter, and revenue declined 17%, as the Metrology business slowed due to utility workforce availability and physical distancing requirements, including restrictions on approaching or entering residents homes. This is delaying both project deployments and installations of replacement meters. We expect order and revenue trends to normalize over the coming months, as utility workers are able to safely return to meter replacement and instillation. Importantly, our billing pipeline remained strong, and there have been no project cancellations. Despite the near-term challenges, we're very encouraged by the large win we announced with Anglian Water in the UK. The $90 million contract demonstrates the competitiveness of our AMI and digital solutions to drive key international wins. This win in a robust pipeline of AMI opportunities highlight the continued commercial momentum and the differentiated value our offering bring through our combined digital platform, networking, data analytics and metrology capabilities. Total segment backlog grew 3% year-over-year, with backlog shippable in 2021 and beyond up 12%. Segment margin performance was primarily driven by the impacts from volume declines on neither replacement activity and project deployment delays stemming from COVID-19, while we continue critical investments to support growth. Looking forward, we expect meaningful leverage on the upside as revenue growth drive increased incremental margins from recent large contract wins. With continued commercial momentum and growing project backlogs, our MCS segment will be a significant source of revenue growth and margin expansion for the company in 2021 and beyond. Now, please turn to Slide 9. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.6 billion in cash and total liquidity of roughly $2.4 billion, driven by the $1 billion Green Bond offering we issued in June, as well as strong cash flow performance in the quarter. The Green Bond offering was opportunistic, enabling us to lock in longer maturities at historically low rates, while effectively prefunding $600 million of maturities due in October 2021 at an after-tax cost of less than 1%. This offering was also the latest example of the importance of linking our financing strategy to our sustainability goals. Given the strength of our financial position and liquidity, I'll take a moment to note that our capital allocation strategy remains unchanged. Alongside funding organic investments in key strategic areas, M&A remains a top priority, and we maintain a healthy pipeline of opportunities, which we closely monitor. Now, turning to cash flow. Our performance in the quarter was very strong. Operating cash flow improved roughly 50% year-over-year, and our free cash flow of $137 million more than doubled from the prior year. This was driven by the continued focus and discipline around working capital, the timing of payment on taxes, and the prioritization of our capital spend, which was $44 million in the quarter, down almost 30% from the prior year.  Working capital as a percentage of sales improved 110 basis points year-over-year, as our teams continue to drive hard on collections and payment terms, while managing inventories in a very challenging demand environment. I'm pleased with our overall cash performance to the first half of the year and we now expect free cash flow conversion for this year will be at least 100%.  And with that, I'll hand it back to Patrick. Given the uncertainties related to the reemergence of COVID-19 across parts of the US and other geographies and its potential ramifications for the back half of the year, we're not re-instating full year guidance. However, we do have reasonable visibility through the third quarter which I'll briefly highlight. We expect revenue declines of 8% to 12%, and operating margins in the range of 11% to 11 .5%. This reflects approximately 200 basis points of sequential margin improvement and year-over-year decrementals of approximately 45%. The decremental margins are impacted by continued softness in our high margin de-watering in North American census water businesses, along with a tough prior year compared to last year's third quarter, where we had 90% incremental margins on revenue growth. While we've seen some positive trends in the second quarter, the global economic landscape remains uncertain, and we are, by no means, out of the woods. While Europe is showing positive trends towards recovery, we're closely monitoring the trajectory in the United States. The pandemics impact varies widely across emerging markets, from a return to normalcy in China, to ongoing shutdowns in India, and in parts of Latin America. Lastly, I want to provide a little more clarity on the structural cost the actions we announced in early June. In that announcement, we detailed our plans for permanent actions to simplify our operations and increase our ability to act as one company. These actions help us better serve our customers and afford us long-term financial resilience. This year, we expect to incur $80 million to $100 million in restructuring and realignment charges. This predominantly reflects the actions that we announced in early June, but also some carryover related to prior programs. We've also provided a summary table on the slide which details the total savings we expect to realize in 2020 and 2021 from our announced structural cost programs. As a reminder, that includes savings from restructuring and realignment actions we initiated before this year, as well as savings from actions we announced in June of this year. In total, we expect to realize approximately $70 million in savings this year, and an additional savings of approximately $80 million in 2021. Now, please turn to slide 14. And Patrick will close with some final remarks. That is correct, Deane, on both counts. Thank you. Yes. Deane, that's exactly what it is. It is, the benefit of - the ramp in some of those restructuring savings in Q3. It was a $115 million deal, but it was still a heck of a sacrifice. Thank you. It is, it is more to come. More to come, Scott. That's right, Patrick, our 2025 goals and the way it works is, as we achieve those goals, we get credit. Those goals are audited, that performance is audited by Sustainalytics. And but it's interesting in addition to the benefit on the rate. What was fascinating was the amount of demand that we got from investors who are focused on sustainable missions. And - the offering was five times oversubscribed, in no small part to the fact that we had almost 50% of those investors as focused on sustainable mission. So, not only do we have an opportunity by executing against our very important sustainability goals to drive the rate down, but it was very helpful from a pricing perspective. Thank you very much. Yes. And the margins are typically about 1.5 times the size of a project when you get into, again, installed base in the aftermarket piece. Yes. I mean, the good news was backlog was up, hopefully. But, again, the overall revenue was certainly down again considerably in the quarter. Yes. Sure. Andy, yes. The - you know, we started off the quarter down mid-single digits. And yes, its mid-single digits - I wish it was mid-single digits. Mid-teens. Matt is like flashing me, no. Mid-single digits. But, - and that was true for got a little bit better in May and then we had a really strong June. So, we ended up down low-double digits 12%. And as we mentioned, orders were still in the quarter down 9%. July, we're seeing some modest improvement, and that's encouraging. But, you know, as we look at the Q3 outlook, you know, the fact is we're - you know, shippable backlog for the quarter is less than 2%. And so, we're still going to need a strong, you know, orders performance in the next two months. And we think, all in, we're well aligned with - you know, with what we laid out in terms of the range, which obviously is tighter than we had last quarter because we have better \u2013 you know, some better visibility. Yeah. And it's - and I think the numbers, it's not quite that large. It's probably in the 20s, and it's a number of smaller lines of business and just those that aren't as profitable nor it is core to our mission moving forward. Yes so, I would say that the - your question of margins, we certainly expect to be, in the black and see positive margins. We'd expect second quarter to - the third quarter to be positive. We were just about, breakeven in Q2. So, with a little bit of a ramp in terms of some of the deployments, the installations and just cross actions, we're going to see improvement there. I think Patrick I'm sure out use that. I think in terms of lessons learned, I think the - what we've learned is, adoption of some of these new technologies is a little bit more challenging particularly in the developed markets. But I think in terms of the capabilities that we've built particularly what we're seeing through this pandemic in the discussions that we're having with customers. I think we're - very pleased with what we have done, the acquisitions we've made, and the capabilities we've built, you know, as we emerge from the pandemic - is that is going to provide us we believe, with a competitive advantage. Yes, Nate absolutely - a couple of reasons. One, we're going to see a bigger ramp as Patrick mentioned earlier, in terms of our cost savings. And then secondly, we had some items that made to compare - some items last year that made to compare this year tougher so. Yes so, we do expect to see that normalize in the fourth quarter."

At this time, all participants have been placed on a listen-only mode and the floor will be open for your questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Matt Latino, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nMatt Latino: Thank you, Kristy. Good morning everyone and welcome to Xylem's first quarter earnings conference call. With me today are Chief Executive Officer, Patrick Decker; Chief Financial Officer, Mark Rajkowski and Chief Supply Chain Officer, Tony Milando. They will provide their perspective on Xylem's first quarter results and our outlook. Following our prepared remarks, we will address questions related to the information covered on the call. I will ask that you please keep to one question and a follow-up and then return to the queue.

Now, please turn to Slide 4 and I will turn the call over to Patrick Decker.\nPatrick Decker: Thanks Matt. Good morning, everyone. Let me start by expressing my sincere hope that you and those close to you are keeping safe and well. Predictably this earnings call is going to be different than normal. The full team is not here with us. It's only Matt, Mark and I that are together and we're spread rather distantly around a big room. Given the times we're in, we're going to keep our prepared remarks brief. As it's especially important, we leave more of the call for Q&A. I'll start by sharing how we've guided our COVID-19 response around the world. As you know, we felt the impact of the outbreak early given our sizable business in China. Our anticipation of that impact in isolation turned out to be just about right. And our business there has recovered strongly. Having said that, as the impact spread across Europe, and then the US, we saw steeper declines in revenue than we expected. So we moved early to reduce spending and are now finalizing further structural cost actions. We're privileged to serve markets in which our products and technologies are vital to the continuity of essential services. And having entered this period in a very strong financial position, we've been able to maintain and even further enhance our liquidity since then. So looking ahead, economic conditions are evolving too quickly to forecast demand in the near term. So we consider it premature to reset guidance just now. We will however, share what we're seeing in our end markets and offer more detail about our outlook. We'll address how we see the marketplace responding to the pandemic, including a notable flight to quality, and we'll share how we're using that to shape our investments, as certain trends accelerate across the sector. In particular, we see COVID-19 shifting how our customers are thinking about sustaining their essential services. And that provides an opportunity to shape both our cost structure and our investment priorities to emerge in a strong position on the other side of the pandemic. Before we get into the results, it's important to provide some insight into how we've responded to the spread of COVID-19. I want to begin by expressing how deeply humbling it is to watch frontline utility operators all around the world step up to serve their communities. They are delivering essential services in extremely difficult circumstances. I'm also very proud of the Xylem team's response supporting these folks. When COVID-19 emerged in Wuhan, China, our team activated our business continuity plan. Their first priority was to provide for the safety and well-being of our frontline colleagues, our customers and our partners. We then quickly moved to understand our customers' most urgent needs. It was clear that water, sanitation and hygiene were going to be essential to combating the spread of the disease. So we shored up our supply chains and we got critical equipment into our customers' hands so they could keep essential services flowing. We then acted to protect our financial and competitive position. With the China team's response underway, we activated our corporate pandemic plan to coordinate actions around the world. We put Tony Milando, our Chief Supply Chain Officer in charge of the global response effort. Tony is with us on the call today to answer any specific questions you may have about that response. As COVID-19 spread beyond the initial outbreak to major supply hubs like Italy and Germany, and then we dealt with lockdowns across the US, India and elsewhere, we apply those same principles model first in China. We also significantly reduced our spending both in the areas of OpEx and CapEx. And we put in place a package of employee support to underpin the well-being of our workforce, and to make sure they could focus on serving our customers mission critical work. Before passing the Mark to talk about Q1, I also want to mention how rewarding it's been to partner with our customers to help communities around the world. Through Xylem Watermark, our corporate citizenship program, our employees have found ways both large and small, to support the sustainability of our communities, working side by side with our customers and our channel partners and I'm so proud of all of them. Now with that, I'm going to hand it over to Mark to provide detail on the first quarter.\nMark Rajkowski: Thanks Patrick. Please turn to Slide 6. First, I'd like to give a big shout out on incredible teams working tirelessly to support our customers, whether working remotely, in our factories or in the field. Thanks to all of you. Now, let's turn to the first quarter results. Organic revenues declined 8% in the quarter, of that we believe COVID-19 ultimately had about a 5% impact on organic revenue growth for the quarter. The market softness we anticipated played out largely as expected until mid-March when we saw a sudden and broad impact as the pandemic spread from China to Europe and North America. From an end market perspective, industrial, commercial and residential markets each declined double digits, driven somewhat by expected underlying market softness, but more significantly by the impact of COVID-19 as factories, supply chains and customer operations were subject to shut down around the world. Utilities end market declined 5% as some project work was delayed, but operations and maintenance spending remain relatively steady. Geographically, all major regions declined in the quarter. Western Europe fared relatively well with growth in several countries in the first two months of the quarter. Emerging Markets declined double digits, including a 35% year-over-year decline in China due to mandatory shutdowns. US was down 7% on broad weakness with utilities showing the most resilience. Overall orders were down 2% with growth in utilities offset by declines in the other end markets. However excluding the estimated impact of the spreading pandemic, orders for the company would have grown low single digits in the quarter. Operating margins declined to 6.2%, driven mainly by COVID-19 related volume impacts, and warranty charge in the measurement and control solutions segment which I'll discuss shortly. Earnings per share is $0.23, this includes roughly $0.09 of impact from the pandemic and $0.07 from the warranty charge. Please turn to Slide 7 and I'll review Q1 results by segment. Water infrastructure orders in the first quarter were down 1% organically versus last year. We saw orders growth in the utilities markets more than offset by declines in the industrial side of the business. Organic revenues declined 7% in the quarter. The utilities end market was down 4% organically, while industrial was down double digits led by a 13% decline in the water, driven by volume declines in the oil and gas, construction and mining verticals. We consider the water infrastructure segment to be a proxy for the wastewater portion of the business with exposure to sewer collection networks and treatment processes. Historically, we've seen most utilities protect their operations and maintenance spending budgets during downturns, and we expect this behavior to continue. Please turn to Slide 8. The applied water segment had 5% organic orders decline despite very steady quote activity during the quarter. We're monitoring this metric very closely with our channel partners as well as order cancellations and project delivery delays. And while we haven't experienced any order cancellations, we are seeing some delays in project activity, as our customers were impacted by construction site closures and distancing mandates. Organic revenue declined 10% as the short cycle softness we had expected in our industrial and commercial end markets was exacerbated by the significant impact of project delays and construction site closures driven by COVID-19, most notably in China, which was down over 50% versus last year. Despite the significant impact of lower volumes and absorption from temporary factory closures on operating margins, the team was largely able to offset these impacts with an impressive 460 basis points of productivity and cost savings. Now, please turn to Slide 9. Measurement and control solution segment revenues were down 7% organically in the quarter, primarily driven by the effects of the pandemic, including water project deployment delays, and the impact from supply chain disruptions in our test business. Lower meter replacement demand was also affected beginning in March as physical distance requirements are impacting utilities ability and capacity to perform this work. Orders within the segment declined 3% organically, along with some softness in our recurring meter replacement revenue. We're also beginning to see some utilities choose to postpone project bidding, or delay issuing decisions on project awards. We're keeping in close communication with our utility customers and channel partners to understand their operational challenges. So we can best support them and effectively manage our supply chain. Segment margins in the quarter were significantly impacted by a $15 million warranty charge. This relates to a specific firmware issue and is contained to a limited number of our North American Water customers. The issue was quickly identified and is now being addressed in partnership with our customers. This charge impacted segment operating margins by roughly 430 basis points in the quarter. The impacts from COVID-19 related to lower demand and the availability of key components was approximately 110 basis points in the quarter. Now, please turn to Slide 10 for a discussion on the company's financial position and liquidity. We closed the quarter with a cash balance of $739 million. During the quarter we invested $51 million in CapEx for critical projects and we returned $108 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases to manage dilution. Our free cash flow performance in the quarter was impacted by lower net income and a higher use of cash for working capital. While working capital as a percentage of sales improved 70 basis points over the first quarter of 2019, cash used for working capital in the first quarter this year reflects both the timing of accounts payable, as well as higher inventories due to lower than expected sales. We remain laser focused on cash flow performance and are tracking cash flows and working capital daily. That said we do expect increases in past due receivables as we support key customers and channel partners through this period. We continue to have a strong liquidity position with approximately $1.7 billion available. In this past week we signed two bilateral loan agreements providing $160 million of borrowing capacity at attractive rates. We're confident that our strong financial position, our liquidity and focus on cash flow will enable us to effectively manage through this crisis and support the critical investments needed to enable our long-term profitable growth. With that, I'll hand it back to Patrick.\nPatrick Decker: Thanks Mark. Clearly, the impact of the pandemic is continuing. So we are being appropriately cautious, but we're also in a very strong position. We entered this period on firm foundations, and we are differentiated in ways that position us to outperform over the medium and long-term. We have a proven and durable business model that sits at the heart of essential services and critical infrastructure. And we've shown the strength of our supply chain to keep customers served. Our market leading portfolio of technology positions as well, both with customers and relative to competitors. And our financial strength enables us to deploy capital through the cycle to further differentiate our portfolio in markets that will provide sustainable growth. Our geographic breadth provides an intrinsic hedge and exposes us to the markets that will recover earliest, and the strongest. And we're privileged to have long standing relationships with our customers, built on a platform of brands they have trusted for decades. So while everyone is subject to the same unknowns about the pandemic in the economy, we're very well situated to benefit from the markets flight to quality and to emerge in an even stronger competitive position. So let's look ahead, our customers are already telling us what will be important to them on the other side of this pandemic. Let me take a few moments to share what we're hearing in our end markets and how we'll be helping enhance our customers' resilience. With our utility customers, the impacts will likely be somewhat different for OpEx and CapEx spending. We expect the majority of utility operators OpEx spending to be quite resilient in the short-term, as they focus on mission critical applications and maintaining their operational continuity. We're actually seeing increased opportunity because of their operational pressures. The leaders I speak to say their single biggest COVID-19 challenge is addressing their labor impacts, whether actual infections or quarantines. They struggle to keep their frontline operators in the field. Conventional modes of working have shown cracks under the strain on their networks and workforce creating an imperative to be more resilient. As a result of that, we're seeing new inquiries about remote sensing and automated operations. Anything that helps utilities keep delivering essential services, even when their networks are put under additional operational and financial pressure. On the CapEx side, we expect spending to hold up as it did in the period after the global financial crisis of '08 and '09. That view is also supported by the multiyear CapEx funding mechanisms that utilities can access and the government commitments to continued investment that we're seeing in a number of countries. For that reason, we're not seeing many project cancellations, we are seeing some projects being delayed momentarily, and that's likely to lead to the slowing in our order conversion rate in the near term. Turning to industrial, commercial and residential, we do expect to see a greater impact from slowed economy. So long as industrial cycles are closed, we will see impacts on demand. And specific verticals like marine and beverage dispensing are likely to continue to remain soft as long as stay at home orders are in place. Anticipating questions about the specific impact of the depressed oil and gas market, it is worth mentioning that oil and gas activity is less than 2% of our total revenue. Overall, we will expect to see an industrial recovery in line with the broader economy. Lastly, in commercial, the short-term is going to continue to see construction crews off the job or reduced, especially in COVID-19 hotspots, which will limit site activity and delivery of equipment. For now our backlog remains strong and we are not seeing cancellations. But we are monitoring quote order conversion very closely. With all that said, we anticipate organic revenues will slow further in the second quarter. Even with China showing early signs of recovery, and our factories now operating at near normal levels, we don't anticipate a quick global bounce back. Given the economic outlook, we expect to see organic revenue declines in the second quarter in the range of 20% to 30%. And we're estimating decremental margins at roughly 50%. Bad factors in the incremental cost related to our temporary COVID-19 workforce support pay, which are funded by overhead cost reductions. On cost, as it became clear that COVID-19 would have business impact beyond China. We quickly reduced OpEx and CapEx spending by roughly $100 million for the year. We are now also reducing compensation for myself and the senior leadership team on a temporary basis. We will shortly be implementing more permanent structural cost actions. This will enable our competitiveness in any scenario by applying three principles. First, we're simplifying our cost structure to be aligned with post pandemic ways of working, which includes accelerating the reduction of our overhead cost. Second, we're addressing our business models in the markets most affected by the impacts of COVID-19. And lastly, we're prioritizing our investments based upon the customer needs that will most likely emerge from the pandemic and we're reinforcing our position as a water technology leader. On that last point, as I mentioned above, it is already clear that our customers' needs will be different coming out of the pandemic. They will be adapting to new operation pressures and they will have new ways of working. As a technology leader, we bring the tools of adaptation, the solutions that will make our customers more resilient right away and for the future. So our plans prioritize the investment that will reinforce our competitiveness by focusing on the areas where customers will need us most as they adapt through this challenging period and on the other side. In summary, there's a reasonable view that in tough times critical infrastructure is a good business to be in. I would actually rather say it's a privilege to work in the water sector. Our customers have shown extraordinary resolve in delivering essential services in a time of need. Whether in good times or bad, solving water and natural resource challenges is work that always matters. It's just now. However, it's also work at the heart of the world's public health defense network. The same strings to give customers confidence in Xylem is their partner in that work. Also drive our medium and long-term investment thesis. Our leading market positions, our depth of install base and our differentiated portfolio underpin our ability to drive sustainable and profitable growth. Our discipline delivery and execution enables us to drive sustainable margin expansion. Our financial strength, which customers depend on especially in difficult times, relies on our robust balance sheet and demonstrated cash flow. Our innovation, in anticipating customers' challenges is underpinned by investment in R&D and capital deployment to further strengthen our portfolio. And lastly, our commitment to create value for all our stakeholders underpins the sustainability of this company, our customers and our communities. With that, I'd like to open up to questions. And just a quick reminder again that in addition to Matt and Mark we also have Tony Milando two on the line. As Tony has been leading our COVID-19 response team and he can provide more color on those specifics. Operator, let's open it up for Q&A.\nMatt Latino: Kristy?\nOperator: Thank you. The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Your first question is coming from Scott Davis of Melius Research.\nScott Davis: Good morning guys.\nPatrick Decker: Hey, good morning Scott. Hope you're well.\nScott Davis: Thank you. I'm and I hope you are as well.\nMark Rajkowski: Thank you.\nScott Davis: There's a lot in here. Patrick and rough outlook you provided, but maybe we could start off with just the decrementals, the 50%. Not a surprise in the short-term, but would you expect that to moderate down once you get to 3Q, 4Q and any best guess of what it might moderate down to?\nPatrick Decker: Yeah, so I'll take it first, Scott. Yes, we definitely expect the decrementals to moderate over the course of the back half of the year. Part of the abruptness here in Q2 is the temporary support pay that we've got for our folks and some of our communities and customer support. We do expect that will moderate as things return back to some semblance of normalcy. Two, it's also a mix of business within the quarter that we see. And then third, we'll have the benefit of the overhead cost reductions that we're implementing both temporary right now, but also the permanent structural reduction. In terms of what it will moderate to, that's yet to be determined, although historically we've talked about decremental margins somewhere more in that 35% kind of range over time. But we won't see that until more likely the second half of the year.\nMark Rajkowski: Yeah, I think in Q2, what we're seeing based upon order trends, and what we're hearing from customers, the businesses that are being impacted unfortunately are some of the richest in terms of margin profile. So dewatering for example is certainly at the top of that list, in terms of margins and year-over-year impact. And we're seeing some of the same in our test business, which is very rich margins as well as in the North American Water side of the business for M&CS, so all of those are very rich in terms of the margin mix. But to Patrick's point, what it looks like going forward is a function of that mix volumes, but also, we will see benefit on the cost side that'll be reflected.\nScott Davis: Okay, that's helpful. And then since we got Tony on the line, you commented, I think either Patrick or Mark commented on the supply chain disruptions in test. What was that specifically, maybe a little bit color there and thanks for the question.\nPatrick Decker: Thank you, Scott. Tony are you on?\nTony Milando: I am on. Are we talking about the supply chain disruption as a result of the warranty issue or just overall the \u2013\nPatrick Decker: No, specifically for analytics test, so that was \u2013\nTony Milando: The virus \u2013 the virus you're talking \u2013\nPatrick Decker: Let me just hit the high \u2013 I mean, there were a number of components coming in from China Tony, maybe you can give a little bit more color.\nTony Milando: Yeah. Sure. Yeah, we did, we had a number of components, particularly in electronics that came in from China that were disrupted for a short period of time. We also had one COVID case there that shut the factory down for a couple of days. So now up and running and that person's back at work, and we're \u2013 that supply chain issue is behind us now.\nScott Davis: Okay, good luck, guys. Thank you,\nPatrick Decker: Thank you, Scott.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is from Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets.\nDeane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nPatrick Decker: Good morning, Deane. Hope you're well.\nDeane Dray: Hey, thanks and same for the Xylem team.\nPatrick Decker: Thank you.\nDeane Dray: Hey, just \u2013 wonder if I understand some of the dynamics here on the municipal side. I appreciate some of the differences in the outlook for the second quarter within wastewater seems pretty steady. And it seems like the clean water side has had more the disruptions. I can only imagine if you can't put in any smart meters in homes because they can't get in, that must mean the Philadelphia project is must beyond hold. But can you size for us, what the whole disruption is on meter deployments and maybe we can start there?\nMark Rajkowski: Yeah. Hey, Deane, it's Mark. There's a couple of pieces to it. One is you nailed it relative to the impact on some of the deployments. And you mentioned one specifically, but there are others out there. And it's also \u2013 to the point you made, having some impact relative to that just the ability to physically go in and do some of that work. And the utilities are really focused on critical repair issues at this point. So not that this isn't important work and won't continue. But it's certainly been pushed out as less essential. And some of the other things we need to deal with.\nPatrick Decker: Yes, Deane, this is Patrick. And all the conversations I've had with many, many utility CEOs over the last month. Their single biggest challenge right now is obviously keeping their labor force out in the field, whether it be again inability to access residential meter repair installation, or again, just having the workforce available in general, given the impact of the virus on their workforce. But I do want to be clear, we've not seen project cancellations and if anything what the utility CEOs are saying is that they're actually looking to double down here in the latter half of the year on accelerating implementations, spinning out their CapEx budgets because of some uncertainty around what the next regulatory approval process might look like in terms of funding. So they're going to see a surge in their view here in the second half of the year. We've also continued to see some large international projects that we had been pursuing that are very much remaining on track. And even a bit of optimism there in terms of those moving forward again, nothing to share right now. So we'll have more on that later.\nDeane Dray: Thanks. And just as a follow up to Scott's question on the decrementals and Mark in your answer, I certainly understand there are certain businesses like dewatering that you're going to see deeper decrementals and so helping us calibrate the second quarter decrementals, can you kind of size for us the segments and how they would shake out on decrementals?\nMark Rajkowski: I would say the \u2013 I think we really look at it on an end market basis and as we think about utilities, we're expecting to see on the top line down mid 20s including and that would include the clean water side with M&CS. In terms of industrial that's probably going to be down closer to 30%. And think of a big part of that that's going to be led by dewatering. Okay. And that's embedded in the transport, business in the water infrastructure business. And then commercial is going to be close to 20%, 20% plus and resi down about 30. But in terms of the margin by segment, I think water infrastructure will probably be the most resilient, I would say, followed by AWS and with some of the challenges we just talked about on the clean water side, probably M&CS a little bit more severe.\nPatrick Decker: Yeah, directionally the detrimental margins for water infrastructure and for the applied water business are going to be pretty similar to what they've been historically. They're going to be in that kind of 30% plus range. I think we're going to see \u2013 what we're expecting in Q2, the largest decremental impact is going to be in M&CS. And that's because we've got a large labor and service piece there that we're going to hang on to because we don't want to let them go and we want to bring them back at this point and so we're going to absorb some overhead there. That will be impacting us in Q2. That gets a whole lot better in the second half of the year, although we're not guiding to that at this point in time. And then lastly you do have this kind of across the board temporary employee support package that we built in. That is also built into that 50% decrementals.\nDeane Dray: Great, that's exactly what I was looking for that you're making that investment in MCNS and that carries into the second quarter.\nPatrick Decker: Yeah, it's a pretty big cost base.\nDeane Dray: Alright, thank you, best of luck to everyone.\nPatrick Decker: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is from Ryan Connors of Boenning & Scattergood.\nRyan Connors: Great, thanks for taking my question. Hope everybody's well. I appreciate all the detail today.\nPatrick Decker: Thank you, same here Ryan.\nRyan Connors: So I want to just probe a little further on the municipal outlook. I mean, obviously, that segment of the market's always been very late cycle in nature and there's a tendency now to talk about 2Q, 3Q even '21, but if you look at the last cycle, it really didn't even bottom out until four or five years out, 2012, 2013. So it's not the current generation of projects that's at risk, those are funded, but it's really the projects that are at a much earlier stage of exploration that would have been funded next year and beyond that don't end up happening. And obviously, now we got talked about the state and local bailout, which is a factor and we'll get your take on that as well. But, but what do you think about the real intermediate term outlook not 2Q, 3Q or even '21, but '22, '23 as we move through all this?\nPatrick Decker: Sure. Yeah, so it's a great question Ryan. I think the \u2013 what I'm hearing from the utility CEOs as we sit here today, and this is a global conversation, not just a North American conversation, is they're not calling that. They're not they're not making that judgment at this point in time that this is going to be like previous financial crises. Even during financial crisis in the past, as you well know that 70% of their spending that is OpEx remains quite resilient because it's again, basic essential services, it really is that 30% of CapEx that can move around. And right now, that's not what we're hearing from them. I mean, we're keeping a close eye on that obviously, we don't want to have deaf ears to that. But they're viewing this as a bit different from a financial crisis, given the human and health nature of this one. They're not calling for a snapback immediately, but they're also not calling for a depression situation in terms of not being able to get projects funded because of a number of the bailouts that are being discussed at this point in time provided at the state local level. So that's the best view we have on it right now.\nRyan Connors: Got it, okay. And my other one had to do with \u2013 and you touched on this \u2013\nPatrick Decker: I mean I'll just add also there \u2013 I would also add there that again, the reason I bring up the global component of that is, we've actually seen a pretty strong snapback already in China and India in terms of building up critical infrastructure there on the waterside.\nRyan Connors: Okay, good. Now, then my other one had to do with \u2013 you touched on this in some of your prepared remarks, but innovation is so core to your strategy or identity as a company, 100 million is a big number. So presumably nothing's immune to the cuts that are going on, but how do you make sure that you continue to maintain that position in terms of not only the dollar spent on R&D, but how disrupted is your ability to sort of feel what the customer is needing in terms of all these trade shows being cancelled? I mean, in theory, those are \u2013 you have people out there with their ears to the ground that they're not out there. So talk about how all this is impacting that project or that innovation funnel?\nPatrick Decker: Yeah, that's a great point. You can be rest assured that we are absolutely committed to preserving our innovation investments. And what I would say is this has allowed us to \u2013 there's \u2013 it's oftentimes said that it's not usually brand new innovations or trends that pop up coming out of a crisis, it accelerates trends that were already there. And that's certainly what we're seeing right now, especially within the utility space, but quite frankly, across each one of the verticals. And let me take it in a couple parts. So we are staying very close to our customers directly. But also, this has afforded us the opportunity to get even closer in discussions with organizations like Wes the owners of WesTech. They're talking about how they're going to be doing things remotely in terms of a trade show. And that led us to having great conversations with them around also how we use them as a conduit for feedback they're getting from various constituents on innovation themes coming out of this. And so we're in regular interaction with them in those conversations, so there are themes like, again, remote asset management, again, supporting remote workforce along the way, the issue of affordability in terms of how they become more productive in their OpEx, but also how they make their CapEx more affordable going forward has allowed us to actually accelerate the conversations that we had in place on our digital offerings. And we've actually had a significant increase in activity in that type of conversation and request for bids. A number of utilities are now able to action, what they refer to as their emergency procurement protocols to be able to move on with that activity that they were otherwise struggling to be able to do. So there are a number of these areas that we actually see as a silver lining as we get through the other side of this pandemic.\nRyan Connors: Got it, well, thanks for your time this morning.\nPatrick Decker: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is from Nathan Jones of Stifel.\nNathan Jones: Good morning, everyone.\nPatrick Decker: Good morning. Hope you're well.\nNathan Jones: I am. Thank you, hope you guys are too. I'd like to go back to some of the cost actions here. You guys talked about $100 million of reduction in spend. Can you break that out between CapEx and P&L cost? And then you talked about some structural cost reductions going forward. Can you give us any idea of what the magnitude of those might be when they might be implemented when we might start seeing the benefits from this?\nMark Rajkowski: Yeah, Nathan, let me let me start and give you a little bit of color on the 100 million. That breaks down roughly $40 million of reductions in CapEx, both was critical as well as just less need for certain capacity because of the demand. But also, we're focused on taking out roughly $60 million of OpEx spend and it's not so much focused on employees, it's focused on spending that we're doing outside, consultants, professional services, et cetera.\nNathan Jones: So we've seen a lot of a lot of company, following workers, reducing work weeks from 40 to 32 hours in order to increase these temporary cost reductions, which are impacting the decrementals in the second quarter. It sounds like you guys have taken a decision not to do that. Can you talk about that decision and what led you to that?\nPatrick Decker: No, actually, just to clarify, Nate, we are going to be taking those actions. And so those \u2013 some of those are underway, some more of those will be coming here in the immediate term. I don't want to get into the details on the call here as to what that is. We are going to be taking those temporary actions, but it's really in service to \u2013 we're all on this together. So the faster that we're able to move on to more permanent structural changes, obviously, the less deep we have to go in the temporary, but we \u2013 these are all going to be done in service to each other that we're all on this together as one company. We are \u2013 to the latter part of your first question, which was on the permanent structural side, what the size of that is and when would we begin to see the benefits of that? We're being very purposeful and thoughtful in our approach to those structural actions. We're not just in a rush to cut, we really have been working feverishly on making sure we have a good understanding as best we can as to what are the structural changes in our customer sets coming out of this pandemic and align ourselves accordingly. I think we all recognize in this world that we've learned the hard way, all of us, to be able to do a lot more with less. And that's all factoring into our thinking on what the permanent structural changes will be, so more of that to come in our next earnings call. We are going to be taking those actions here in the immediate term. We will see benefits as I mentioned earlier, it will improve the decremental margins in the second half of the year. It will obviously have an even larger impact and benefit in 2021 just given the fact that we do have approvals we have to get and works councils and things like that in various parts of the world.\nNathan Jones: Thanks for that. And if I could just slip one in on the industrial side of the business, I would think that is probably the area where you've seen the most impact from broad lockdowns and businesses that you would normally service actually being shut down. Do you guys have any visibility into what the impact of the shutdown specifically rather than just general lower industrial activity is being. And I would think you would expect to see that snap back relatively quickly as we start to get global economies open here, just any commentary you have on that?\nPatrick Decker: Yeah, I think you've read it right Nate. It is where we've seen the single biggest impact in the immediate term both in Q1 as well as in what we're looking at in terms of Q2. And I would say they're \u2013 the impact, really is that you've got sites that have simply been shut down on the industrial side of the equation and therefore if they're not up and running and they're not going to be at our pumps, and other ancillary services along the way. We've also had some impact within our indirect channel. We sell to distribution largely into that area. And so they've also had their lockdown and kind of work at home policies. So it's as simple as that. You're right. I mean, we definitely expect that as things open up, and that might be a little better in Q2 than what we're calling for. Who knows? We think we're being prudent right now and cautionary on Q2. But certainly as things begin to reopen in the second half of the year, then there will be \u2013 we would expect to be a meaningful snapback. And there will probably be some pent up demand at that point in time that we can benefit from, but it's too early for us to call that.\nNathan Jones: Fair enough. Thanks for all the detail. I'll pass it on.\nPatrick Decker: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Michael Halloran of Baird.\nMichael Halloran: Good morning everyone.\nPatrick Decker: Good morning, Mike.\nMichael Halloran: So just first on the offence, defense side on the capital deployment, how are you guys thinking about balancing the liquidity needs in the short-term. In fact, the cash flow is probably going to be a little softer in the short-term with that that you have a lot of liquidity and the environment might create a lot of opportunity for you guys on the M&A side over time and any other things you're thinking about from a capital usage perspective.\nMark Rajkowski: Sure, yeah. Morning, but I would start by saying, we do enter this with a very, very strong both cash position, but liquidity broadly. We are going to continue focusing on those areas that \u2013 our highest returning which is continuing to fund the investments we need to grow the business. We talked about that earlier, in response to Deane's question, that it's important that we maintain those critical investments to grow over the long-term. Secondly, given our liquidity position, and there's not \u2013 let's face it, I mean, deals are not going to get done in the near term, but we are going to be focused on keep \u2013 our ear to the ground. We know where we want to play. We know we want to participate. And we have our list out there and at the right time, we think we'll be well positioned to take advantage.\nPatrick Decker: Yeah, and I would just add to Mike is that as you and the others will know, I mean, in these times the strong gets stronger through this. And we're going to be strategic and continue to be appropriately aggressive to support our long-term strategies that we laid out before those remain unchanged. Perhaps maybe some of the things that we invest in from an R&D standpoint get differentiated a little bit more based upon what we learned through the pandemic. And again, that's just part of the strong getting stronger. Again, I don't want to over use the phrase of flight to quality, but there's clearly going to be a flight to quality here. And we're confident that that's the position that we're in and we're not going to waver from our original commitments.\nMichael Halloran: It makes a lot of sense and agree. And the second one, just from lessons learned from China and what you're seeing there more specifically, maybe just talk a little bit about the production ramp versus what you're seeing in the demand side qualitatively. Obviously, production seems to be coming back online, how is demand tracking relative to that and what kind of cadence do you see? Sure, yeah. So Tony, if Tony is still on the line, I'm going to hand over to you, Tony just in one second. I would say on the demand side, we have seen a bounce back in demand in China and India. Again, we're being prudent and cautious there as to where that's happening, which product lines, which verticals it's coming through, but we have seen the snapback in demand. But Tony, do you want to talk about lessons learned on the supply chain and the resilience there.\nTony Milando: Sure, yeah. So our current capacity globally is about 90%. Our China facility was \u2013 facilities were down for about 10 days after Chinese New Year before they came back. In the first week, they were back at about half capacity. And now they're back up to 100%. And they're fully loaded right now. A lot of pent up demand, as Patrick mentioned, is coming back into some of the China facilities right now. Some of the lessons that we've learned were around communication, around safety and safety has been a stronghold for us for many years now. We've cut our incident rate down by 50% over the last four or five years and this has really been elevated. So temperature checks, PPE, social distancing and we've learned quite a bit from that model. And we're able to deploy that a lot quicker. In Italy, for instance, where we saw really no production downtime, we got low, but we never shut down the facility. And in fact, in our 50 facilities around the world, only one of those is shut down right now, which is in India. In fact the other Indian facilities are actually up and running from last week. So putting those safety measures in place, that communication measures in place have really helped us keep our employees healthy and the fact that we're all in deemed essential services almost everywhere as allowed our facilities to stay up and running.\nPatrick Decker: And I would just add to that. Tony mentioned communications. And I know it may be a little salty for this call, but on the communications front, really, for the past several weeks, since things really began to spread and it was deemed a pandemic. We've leveraged our own internal platforms to \u2013 every Tuesday I do an all hands call with all of our folks around the world and it just kind of ask me anything kind of what's on their mind. And then every Thursday, I have a call with our top 400 leaders to hear what's on their mind and just to kind of pass along critical elements communications, so I do think all it seems soft. There's a lot that comes out of that that keeps us in touch with what's actually happening. And that further informs what our overall response plan is good.\nMark Rajkowski: I would say Tony and his team have done a tremendous job in terms of the supply chain, making sure we've got good visibility into critical components and supply from Tier 1, Tier 2 suppliers as well. So that's been very helpful.\nMichael Halloran: I appreciate everyone, thank you so much.\nPatrick Decker: Thank you, Mike.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is from Joe Giordano of Cowen.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey, good morning. This is Robert in for Joe. Just switching to free cash flow here for a second, just want to see if you can expand on your expectations for the rest of the year. How does the cadence look? And then as volume goes down, do you think you can translate that into better cash and release some working capital from that and turn that into cash?\nMark Rajkowski: Yeah, that would certainly be the plan. With some of the impact on volume we'll release some working capital, but we're also mindful of the fact that it's some of our customers are under stress. So we need to be on top of collecting our receivable. Some of our key customers and channel partners are under stress, so we're going to look to support them, but on the whole, as volumes decline, you'd see some release of working capital for sure.\nPatrick Decker: And just a bunch of weight that I want to make sure we're clear here that what we're talking about in terms of any relief for customers, that's a very targeted and it's very temporary. Key cost it's very temporary and we would expect that to normalize and course correct in the second half of the year, so that really is more of a comment on here in the immediate term. That's not a comment on the year.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay, that helps, thank you. And then just the follow up would be, just kind of looking at tensions between the US and China and how political tensions are rising there, is this something that you're worried about in kind of the longer term, medium term and can you just provide a little color about how you're thinking about that situation is certain to kind of emerge and become something that's being talked about.\nPatrick Decker: Yeah, sure, I'll \u2013 yeah, I'll \u2013 this is Patrick. So it's certainly something that \u2013 I mean, given that China is now our second largest market around the world, although, it still doesn't come close to the size of the of the US market for us. The reality is that we've been dealing with these tensions between the US and China for quite some time now. And even though they may be heating up again now and maybe get worse, who knows? The reality is we are seeing it's such a multiple company in China. We don't have a single expat, the look and feel for any of those of you that have been there know that we are very much seen as a local company there. That is high quality. Secondly, the fact that roughly two thirds or 70% of our business goes into the water, infrastructure space, most notably utilities, its critical essential services. And we've to this point, not seeing any disruption even through the previous trade tensions and other discussions along the way. So we feel we're pretty immune to that. I think the third of our business that is commercial and industrial, that's tied more to the broader macroeconomic outlook for China. And we actually see that part of the business is improving right now because there is a return to some level of normality in China, the economy along the way. So we \u2013 I don't want to say we're down to it, but we're not concerned about the tensions between the US and China from a business standpoint.\nUnidentified Analyst: That's great. Thank you very much for taking my questions and stay safe everyone. Thank you.\nPatrick Decker: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is from Saree Boroditsky of Jefferies.\nSaree Boroditsky: Good morning.\nPatrick Decker: Good morning.\nSaree Boroditsky: I appreciate your COVID-19 impact on organic growth in the quarter. Could you provide some color on how you derive that? Was it operational issues or demand impact?\nMatt Latino: Yeah, it was it was really a combination in terms of just customers not being able to continue on with certain project work, particularly in China because things were shut down. We saw in the US, in Europe, the demand slowed down on certain order and shipments at the end of the second half of March. But we also were impacted on the supply chain side. And I mentioned earlier in our test business, not solely in our test business, but largely there in terms of components that we were not able to get, which impacted our ability to ship.\nPatrick Decker: I would just add that the \u2013 I want to go back to comments we made in the prepared remarks and that is, I think it's important for everyone to understand the reason why we were down further in Q1 and at least we're guiding right now to be down steeper in Q2 is, one really needs to follow the virus. It hit first in China. We've got a disproportionate amount of business in China relative to other companies in our space. It really didn't hit fully until really in late March into April, coming out of it now. It then moved to Italy, to Spain, to Germany, where we've got major supply points and hubs for not just Europe, but also for some of the product lines that we sell into the US. We're now coming out on the other side of the curve of that, but we're already halfway through or almost halfway through the quarter. Then it moves to the US. And that's where we find ourselves in similar situation to competitors and peer companies that have a larger US concentration. And so one really just doesn't need to overcomplicate it, you follow the virus in terms of the impact that had on shutdowns, job sites, factories, et cetera. And that really is how it's flowing through our impact for Q1 and our outlook for Q2 and then we recover in the second half of the year.\nSaree Boroditsky: That's helpful. And I guess on that line, can you provide the cadence of the improvements you saw on demand in China and what the product lines were that bounced back? And is there anything there that you think will apply to the regions as \u2013 the other regions as lockdowns get lifted?\nPatrick Decker: Yeah, Saree, so we saw it in the utilities, certainly we saw a pretty broad base across China. As mentioned in the prepared remarks 50%, more than 50% in applied water, but we saw it in water infrastructure too. You're now seeing us return to utility activity and quoting \u2013 bidding activity that's returned to pre-COVID levels in China. So that's an encouraging sign that our teams have seen. Albeit they're working through what life looks like after the pandemic where those meetings have changed, a lot of it is virtual, a lot of it is less people than previously done. So we're getting back that. We're starting to learn what that's going to look like for even our European and US businesses, but there's a bit of learning that we've had from the China side.\nSaree Boroditsky: Great, thanks for taking my questions.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is from Andy Kaplowitz of Citi?\nAndy Kaplowitz: Good morning, guys.\nPatrick Decker: Good morning.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Patrick, maybe you could give us some more color on your commercial business. You said the backlog remains robust. But obviously the US, non-US cycle looks like it could be under pressure for a little while. So do you expect the relatively quick snap back in that business as shutdowns end? Or do you worry about a bit of a longer term overhang in that business?\nPatrick Decker: It's a great question. I think the \u2013 so what we've already seen and again, I step back globally. I'll come to the US here in a second. As Matt mentioned, we're already seeing recovery in China. It is lagging the utility side because it's less essential and critical, but it is returning to normality there. And we expect that to be the case, certainly following in Europe and then eventually here in the US. The part of our business right now that's been most heavily impacted is the bucket ship business in the US that was especially hard hit in the northeast in California, where you had the hot spots of COVID-19. The rest of the business is actually held up fairly well in that regard, but it's been very steep in those COVID-19 hotspots. So we do expect and again, as I mentioned earlier, it's not necessarily in all cases where we go direct, it's also the impact it's had on our channel partners, and their ability to be at work. And the feedback that we get from them is that they do still see quoting activity continuing on jobs, it is happening remotely similar to what we see in China. I think we all can kind of relate to that. So that always slows things down a little bit in terms of jobs getting completed, in terms of bid. But we do expect there to be a reasonably strong recovery. But I do think it's going to be prolonged for some period, as things just take a little bit longer to get done as people are working remotely. So I don't think it's going to be a big snapback, it's not going to be a V shape. At least we're not guiding that way at this point. But I just want to make sure everybody understands. It is very much isolated to certain hot spots around the US. It's not a broad based commentary on commercial channel.\nAndy Kaplowitz: That's very helpful.\nMatt Latino: And backlogs are up.\nPatrick Decker: And backlogs are up.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Got it and then Patrick or Mark, maybe can you just give us a little more color on the MCS warranty charge. I mean, you addressed it in the prepared remarks. But what happened and is there any risk of further issues moving forward?\nMark Rajkowski: Yeah, it's, as I said, it's a firmware issue, it's very contained. It's really in a relatively small part of our business. It's in our AMR side, which is the vast majority of our businesses, AMI, FlexNet and other things. So it does not impact FlexNet customers' international business, it's not electric or gas, so fairly contained. They've identified the issue and they're working through with customers right now. So it's very much contained.\nPatrick Decker: And we \u2013 the approach we took on this was to get on it \u2013 as soon as we heard about it, get on it now, like get it behind us, do what we got to do to take care of those customers and move on and that's why we took the charge in the quarter and we're confident that as Mark said, it's very contained. It's an isolated piece of the business, certain number of endpoints. And our customers have responded very positively in terms of the way that we've gotten on it.\nOperator: And thank you. Your next question is from Pavel Molchanov of Raymond James.\nPavel Molchanov: Thanks for taking the question. First on your in-house manufacturing, you referenced India. I think that's the strictest lockdown that you have direct exposure to. As India begins to reopen, I believe this week. What's the latest on that manufacturing site?\nPatrick Decker: Yeah. Tony are you still on?\nTony Milando: Yeah. So first of all, we have two facilities in India. One of the facilities is \u2013 we've been able to get it deemed in essential service and that actually opened up last week. I think the latest lockdown actually has pushed it out to May 15 and so our other facility will remain shut down through May 15. But the first facility, our larger facility actually was opened up last week.\nPavel Molchanov: Got it.\nPatrick Decker: And one of the things \u2013 and one of the learnings that we had coming out of China that I think we didn't mention in our prepared remarks, and I don't think Tony mentioned earlier was, as we saw, again, following the viruses, we saw things moving around the world, one of the things that we did was go ahead and begin to build up inventory in certain factories to get ahead of it, to make sure that we could at least try to minimize supply disruption and just absorb demand flowing, but be able to be prepared for that. And that certainly was also the case in our India factories, the two that we have there.\nPavel Molchanov: Thanks. My follow up question is on the M&A, you said that no one's going to be doing deals in the near term by playing devil's advocate, if there are some distressed M&A situations in water tech, which we have not seen for years and years, given how hot the space has been, would you opportunistically look at those?\nPatrick Decker: Yes. Yeah. I mean, I think our comment there really \u2013 I think the intention of Mark's comment was not that there wouldn't be deals to be done or there won't be activity at all. I think it just \u2013 it always moves things out a little bit more to the right, as people will try to figure out kind of what is the appropriate valuation for their asset and then you can take the time to do the diligence, as Mark pointed. So we're not rushing out, but at the same time, we are very open. Again, our strategy remains unchanged there. We'll be smart about it, both in terms of the pace and the valuations, but you're absolutely right, again, there's a flight to quality and again the strong get stronger in these timeframes.\nPavel Molchanov: Thank you.\nPatrick Decker: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We have reached our allotted time for questions. I will turn the call back over to Patrick Decker for any additional or closing remarks.\nPatrick Decker: Thank you. Thanks, everybody for joining. Again, as we like to say here, stay safe, stay strong, stay focused. We appreciate your time here with us today. I look forward to getting back in touch with you.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude today's Xylem first quarter 2020 earnings conference call. Please disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Patrick Decker",
            "content": "Thanks Matt. Good morning, everyone. Let me start by expressing my sincere hope that you and those close to you are keeping safe and well. Predictably this earnings call is going to be different than normal. The full team is not here with us. It's only Matt, Mark and I that are together and we're spread rather distantly around a big room. Given the times we're in, we're going to keep our prepared remarks brief. As it's especially important, we leave more of the call for Q&A. I'll start by sharing how we've guided our COVID-19 response around the world. As you know, we felt the impact of the outbreak early given our sizable business in China. Our anticipation of that impact in isolation turned out to be just about right. And our business there has recovered strongly. Having said that, as the impact spread across Europe, and then the US, we saw steeper declines in revenue than we expected. So we moved early to reduce spending and are now finalizing further structural cost actions. We're privileged to serve markets in which our products and technologies are vital to the continuity of essential services. And having entered this period in a very strong financial position, we've been able to maintain and even further enhance our liquidity since then. So looking ahead, economic conditions are evolving too quickly to forecast demand in the near term. So we consider it premature to reset guidance just now. We will however, share what we're seeing in our end markets and offer more detail about our outlook. We'll address how we see the marketplace responding to the pandemic, including a notable flight to quality, and we'll share how we're using that to shape our investments, as certain trends accelerate across the sector. In particular, we see COVID-19 shifting how our customers are thinking about sustaining their essential services. And that provides an opportunity to shape both our cost structure and our investment priorities to emerge in a strong position on the other side of the pandemic. Before we get into the results, it's important to provide some insight into how we've responded to the spread of COVID-19. I want to begin by expressing how deeply humbling it is to watch frontline utility operators all around the world step up to serve their communities. They are delivering essential services in extremely difficult circumstances. I'm also very proud of the Xylem team's response supporting these folks. When COVID-19 emerged in Wuhan, China, our team activated our business continuity plan. Their first priority was to provide for the safety and well-being of our frontline colleagues, our customers and our partners. We then quickly moved to understand our customers' most urgent needs. It was clear that water, sanitation and hygiene were going to be essential to combating the spread of the disease. So we shored up our supply chains and we got critical equipment into our customers' hands so they could keep essential services flowing. We then acted to protect our financial and competitive position. With the China team's response underway, we activated our corporate pandemic plan to coordinate actions around the world. We put Tony Milando, our Chief Supply Chain Officer in charge of the global response effort. Tony is with us on the call today to answer any specific questions you may have about that response. As COVID-19 spread beyond the initial outbreak to major supply hubs like Italy and Germany, and then we dealt with lockdowns across the US, India and elsewhere, we apply those same principles model first in China. We also significantly reduced our spending both in the areas of OpEx and CapEx. And we put in place a package of employee support to underpin the well-being of our workforce, and to make sure they could focus on serving our customers mission critical work. Before passing the Mark to talk about Q1, I also want to mention how rewarding it's been to partner with our customers to help communities around the world. Through Xylem Watermark, our corporate citizenship program, our employees have found ways both large and small, to support the sustainability of our communities, working side by side with our customers and our channel partners and I'm so proud of all of them. Now with that, I'm going to hand it over to Mark to provide detail on the first quarter. Thanks Mark. Clearly, the impact of the pandemic is continuing. So we are being appropriately cautious, but we're also in a very strong position. We entered this period on firm foundations, and we are differentiated in ways that position us to outperform over the medium and long-term. We have a proven and durable business model that sits at the heart of essential services and critical infrastructure. And we've shown the strength of our supply chain to keep customers served. Our market leading portfolio of technology positions as well, both with customers and relative to competitors. And our financial strength enables us to deploy capital through the cycle to further differentiate our portfolio in markets that will provide sustainable growth. Our geographic breadth provides an intrinsic hedge and exposes us to the markets that will recover earliest, and the strongest. And we're privileged to have long standing relationships with our customers, built on a platform of brands they have trusted for decades. So while everyone is subject to the same unknowns about the pandemic in the economy, we're very well situated to benefit from the markets flight to quality and to emerge in an even stronger competitive position. So let's look ahead, our customers are already telling us what will be important to them on the other side of this pandemic. Let me take a few moments to share what we're hearing in our end markets and how we'll be helping enhance our customers' resilience. With our utility customers, the impacts will likely be somewhat different for OpEx and CapEx spending. We expect the majority of utility operators OpEx spending to be quite resilient in the short-term, as they focus on mission critical applications and maintaining their operational continuity. We're actually seeing increased opportunity because of their operational pressures. The leaders I speak to say their single biggest COVID-19 challenge is addressing their labor impacts, whether actual infections or quarantines. They struggle to keep their frontline operators in the field. Conventional modes of working have shown cracks under the strain on their networks and workforce creating an imperative to be more resilient. As a result of that, we're seeing new inquiries about remote sensing and automated operations. Anything that helps utilities keep delivering essential services, even when their networks are put under additional operational and financial pressure. On the CapEx side, we expect spending to hold up as it did in the period after the global financial crisis of '08 and '09. That view is also supported by the multiyear CapEx funding mechanisms that utilities can access and the government commitments to continued investment that we're seeing in a number of countries. For that reason, we're not seeing many project cancellations, we are seeing some projects being delayed momentarily, and that's likely to lead to the slowing in our order conversion rate in the near term. Turning to industrial, commercial and residential, we do expect to see a greater impact from slowed economy. So long as industrial cycles are closed, we will see impacts on demand. And specific verticals like marine and beverage dispensing are likely to continue to remain soft as long as stay at home orders are in place. Anticipating questions about the specific impact of the depressed oil and gas market, it is worth mentioning that oil and gas activity is less than 2% of our total revenue. Overall, we will expect to see an industrial recovery in line with the broader economy. Lastly, in commercial, the short-term is going to continue to see construction crews off the job or reduced, especially in COVID-19 hotspots, which will limit site activity and delivery of equipment. For now our backlog remains strong and we are not seeing cancellations. But we are monitoring quote order conversion very closely. With all that said, we anticipate organic revenues will slow further in the second quarter. Even with China showing early signs of recovery, and our factories now operating at near normal levels, we don't anticipate a quick global bounce back. Given the economic outlook, we expect to see organic revenue declines in the second quarter in the range of 20% to 30%. And we're estimating decremental margins at roughly 50%. Bad factors in the incremental cost related to our temporary COVID-19 workforce support pay, which are funded by overhead cost reductions. On cost, as it became clear that COVID-19 would have business impact beyond China. We quickly reduced OpEx and CapEx spending by roughly $100 million for the year. We are now also reducing compensation for myself and the senior leadership team on a temporary basis. We will shortly be implementing more permanent structural cost actions. This will enable our competitiveness in any scenario by applying three principles. First, we're simplifying our cost structure to be aligned with post pandemic ways of working, which includes accelerating the reduction of our overhead cost. Second, we're addressing our business models in the markets most affected by the impacts of COVID-19. And lastly, we're prioritizing our investments based upon the customer needs that will most likely emerge from the pandemic and we're reinforcing our position as a water technology leader. On that last point, as I mentioned above, it is already clear that our customers' needs will be different coming out of the pandemic. They will be adapting to new operation pressures and they will have new ways of working. As a technology leader, we bring the tools of adaptation, the solutions that will make our customers more resilient right away and for the future. So our plans prioritize the investment that will reinforce our competitiveness by focusing on the areas where customers will need us most as they adapt through this challenging period and on the other side. In summary, there's a reasonable view that in tough times critical infrastructure is a good business to be in. I would actually rather say it's a privilege to work in the water sector. Our customers have shown extraordinary resolve in delivering essential services in a time of need. Whether in good times or bad, solving water and natural resource challenges is work that always matters. It's just now. However, it's also work at the heart of the world's public health defense network. The same strings to give customers confidence in Xylem is their partner in that work. Also drive our medium and long-term investment thesis. Our leading market positions, our depth of install base and our differentiated portfolio underpin our ability to drive sustainable and profitable growth. Our discipline delivery and execution enables us to drive sustainable margin expansion. Our financial strength, which customers depend on especially in difficult times, relies on our robust balance sheet and demonstrated cash flow. Our innovation, in anticipating customers' challenges is underpinned by investment in R&D and capital deployment to further strengthen our portfolio. And lastly, our commitment to create value for all our stakeholders underpins the sustainability of this company, our customers and our communities. With that, I'd like to open up to questions. And just a quick reminder again that in addition to Matt and Mark we also have Tony Milando two on the line. As Tony has been leading our COVID-19 response team and he can provide more color on those specifics. Operator, let's open it up for Q&A. Hey, good morning Scott. Hope you're well. Yeah, so I'll take it first, Scott. Yes, we definitely expect the decrementals to moderate over the course of the back half of the year. Part of the abruptness here in Q2 is the temporary support pay that we've got for our folks and some of our communities and customer support. We do expect that will moderate as things return back to some semblance of normalcy. Two, it's also a mix of business within the quarter that we see. And then third, we'll have the benefit of the overhead cost reductions that we're implementing both temporary right now, but also the permanent structural reduction. In terms of what it will moderate to, that's yet to be determined, although historically we've talked about decremental margins somewhere more in that 35% kind of range over time. But we won't see that until more likely the second half of the year. Thank you, Scott. Tony are you on? No, specifically for analytics test, so that was \u2013 Let me just hit the high \u2013 I mean, there were a number of components coming in from China Tony, maybe you can give a little bit more color. Thank you, Scott. Good morning, Deane. Hope you're well. Thank you. Yes, Deane, this is Patrick. And all the conversations I've had with many, many utility CEOs over the last month. Their single biggest challenge right now is obviously keeping their labor force out in the field, whether it be again inability to access residential meter repair installation, or again, just having the workforce available in general, given the impact of the virus on their workforce. But I do want to be clear, we've not seen project cancellations and if anything what the utility CEOs are saying is that they're actually looking to double down here in the latter half of the year on accelerating implementations, spinning out their CapEx budgets because of some uncertainty around what the next regulatory approval process might look like in terms of funding. So they're going to see a surge in their view here in the second half of the year. We've also continued to see some large international projects that we had been pursuing that are very much remaining on track. And even a bit of optimism there in terms of those moving forward again, nothing to share right now. So we'll have more on that later. Yeah, directionally the detrimental margins for water infrastructure and for the applied water business are going to be pretty similar to what they've been historically. They're going to be in that kind of 30% plus range. I think we're going to see \u2013 what we're expecting in Q2, the largest decremental impact is going to be in M&CS. And that's because we've got a large labor and service piece there that we're going to hang on to because we don't want to let them go and we want to bring them back at this point and so we're going to absorb some overhead there. That will be impacting us in Q2. That gets a whole lot better in the second half of the year, although we're not guiding to that at this point in time. And then lastly you do have this kind of across the board temporary employee support package that we built in. That is also built into that 50% decrementals. Yeah, it's a pretty big cost base. Thank you. Thank you, same here Ryan. Sure. Yeah, so it's a great question Ryan. I think the \u2013 what I'm hearing from the utility CEOs as we sit here today, and this is a global conversation, not just a North American conversation, is they're not calling that. They're not they're not making that judgment at this point in time that this is going to be like previous financial crises. Even during financial crisis in the past, as you well know that 70% of their spending that is OpEx remains quite resilient because it's again, basic essential services, it really is that 30% of CapEx that can move around. And right now, that's not what we're hearing from them. I mean, we're keeping a close eye on that obviously, we don't want to have deaf ears to that. But they're viewing this as a bit different from a financial crisis, given the human and health nature of this one. They're not calling for a snapback immediately, but they're also not calling for a depression situation in terms of not being able to get projects funded because of a number of the bailouts that are being discussed at this point in time provided at the state local level. So that's the best view we have on it right now. I mean I'll just add also there \u2013 I would also add there that again, the reason I bring up the global component of that is, we've actually seen a pretty strong snapback already in China and India in terms of building up critical infrastructure there on the waterside. Yeah, that's a great point. You can be rest assured that we are absolutely committed to preserving our innovation investments. And what I would say is this has allowed us to \u2013 there's \u2013 it's oftentimes said that it's not usually brand new innovations or trends that pop up coming out of a crisis, it accelerates trends that were already there. And that's certainly what we're seeing right now, especially within the utility space, but quite frankly, across each one of the verticals. And let me take it in a couple parts. So we are staying very close to our customers directly. But also, this has afforded us the opportunity to get even closer in discussions with organizations like Wes the owners of WesTech. They're talking about how they're going to be doing things remotely in terms of a trade show. And that led us to having great conversations with them around also how we use them as a conduit for feedback they're getting from various constituents on innovation themes coming out of this. And so we're in regular interaction with them in those conversations, so there are themes like, again, remote asset management, again, supporting remote workforce along the way, the issue of affordability in terms of how they become more productive in their OpEx, but also how they make their CapEx more affordable going forward has allowed us to actually accelerate the conversations that we had in place on our digital offerings. And we've actually had a significant increase in activity in that type of conversation and request for bids. A number of utilities are now able to action, what they refer to as their emergency procurement protocols to be able to move on with that activity that they were otherwise struggling to be able to do. So there are a number of these areas that we actually see as a silver lining as we get through the other side of this pandemic. Thank you. Good morning. Hope you're well. No, actually, just to clarify, Nate, we are going to be taking those actions. And so those \u2013 some of those are underway, some more of those will be coming here in the immediate term. I don't want to get into the details on the call here as to what that is. We are going to be taking those temporary actions, but it's really in service to \u2013 we're all on this together. So the faster that we're able to move on to more permanent structural changes, obviously, the less deep we have to go in the temporary, but we \u2013 these are all going to be done in service to each other that we're all on this together as one company. We are \u2013 to the latter part of your first question, which was on the permanent structural side, what the size of that is and when would we begin to see the benefits of that? We're being very purposeful and thoughtful in our approach to those structural actions. We're not just in a rush to cut, we really have been working feverishly on making sure we have a good understanding as best we can as to what are the structural changes in our customer sets coming out of this pandemic and align ourselves accordingly. I think we all recognize in this world that we've learned the hard way, all of us, to be able to do a lot more with less. And that's all factoring into our thinking on what the permanent structural changes will be, so more of that to come in our next earnings call. We are going to be taking those actions here in the immediate term. We will see benefits as I mentioned earlier, it will improve the decremental margins in the second half of the year. It will obviously have an even larger impact and benefit in 2021 just given the fact that we do have approvals we have to get and works councils and things like that in various parts of the world. Yeah, I think you've read it right Nate. It is where we've seen the single biggest impact in the immediate term both in Q1 as well as in what we're looking at in terms of Q2. And I would say they're \u2013 the impact, really is that you've got sites that have simply been shut down on the industrial side of the equation and therefore if they're not up and running and they're not going to be at our pumps, and other ancillary services along the way. We've also had some impact within our indirect channel. We sell to distribution largely into that area. And so they've also had their lockdown and kind of work at home policies. So it's as simple as that. You're right. I mean, we definitely expect that as things open up, and that might be a little better in Q2 than what we're calling for. Who knows? We think we're being prudent right now and cautionary on Q2. But certainly as things begin to reopen in the second half of the year, then there will be \u2013 we would expect to be a meaningful snapback. And there will probably be some pent up demand at that point in time that we can benefit from, but it's too early for us to call that. Thank you. Good morning, Mike. Yeah, and I would just add to Mike is that as you and the others will know, I mean, in these times the strong gets stronger through this. And we're going to be strategic and continue to be appropriately aggressive to support our long-term strategies that we laid out before those remain unchanged. Perhaps maybe some of the things that we invest in from an R&D standpoint get differentiated a little bit more based upon what we learned through the pandemic. And again, that's just part of the strong getting stronger. Again, I don't want to over use the phrase of flight to quality, but there's clearly going to be a flight to quality here. And we're confident that that's the position that we're in and we're not going to waver from our original commitments. And I would just add to that. Tony mentioned communications. And I know it may be a little salty for this call, but on the communications front, really, for the past several weeks, since things really began to spread and it was deemed a pandemic. We've leveraged our own internal platforms to \u2013 every Tuesday I do an all hands call with all of our folks around the world and it just kind of ask me anything kind of what's on their mind. And then every Thursday, I have a call with our top 400 leaders to hear what's on their mind and just to kind of pass along critical elements communications, so I do think all it seems soft. There's a lot that comes out of that that keeps us in touch with what's actually happening. And that further informs what our overall response plan is good. Thank you, Mike. And just a bunch of weight that I want to make sure we're clear here that what we're talking about in terms of any relief for customers, that's a very targeted and it's very temporary. Key cost it's very temporary and we would expect that to normalize and course correct in the second half of the year, so that really is more of a comment on here in the immediate term. That's not a comment on the year. Yeah, sure, I'll \u2013 yeah, I'll \u2013 this is Patrick. So it's certainly something that \u2013 I mean, given that China is now our second largest market around the world, although, it still doesn't come close to the size of the of the US market for us. The reality is that we've been dealing with these tensions between the US and China for quite some time now. And even though they may be heating up again now and maybe get worse, who knows? The reality is we are seeing it's such a multiple company in China. We don't have a single expat, the look and feel for any of those of you that have been there know that we are very much seen as a local company there. That is high quality. Secondly, the fact that roughly two thirds or 70% of our business goes into the water, infrastructure space, most notably utilities, its critical essential services. And we've to this point, not seeing any disruption even through the previous trade tensions and other discussions along the way. So we feel we're pretty immune to that. I think the third of our business that is commercial and industrial, that's tied more to the broader macroeconomic outlook for China. And we actually see that part of the business is improving right now because there is a return to some level of normality in China, the economy along the way. So we \u2013 I don't want to say we're down to it, but we're not concerned about the tensions between the US and China from a business standpoint. Thank you. Good morning. I would just add that the \u2013 I want to go back to comments we made in the prepared remarks and that is, I think it's important for everyone to understand the reason why we were down further in Q1 and at least we're guiding right now to be down steeper in Q2 is, one really needs to follow the virus. It hit first in China. We've got a disproportionate amount of business in China relative to other companies in our space. It really didn't hit fully until really in late March into April, coming out of it now. It then moved to Italy, to Spain, to Germany, where we've got major supply points and hubs for not just Europe, but also for some of the product lines that we sell into the US. We're now coming out on the other side of the curve of that, but we're already halfway through or almost halfway through the quarter. Then it moves to the US. And that's where we find ourselves in similar situation to competitors and peer companies that have a larger US concentration. And so one really just doesn't need to overcomplicate it, you follow the virus in terms of the impact that had on shutdowns, job sites, factories, et cetera. And that really is how it's flowing through our impact for Q1 and our outlook for Q2 and then we recover in the second half of the year. Yeah, Saree, so we saw it in the utilities, certainly we saw a pretty broad base across China. As mentioned in the prepared remarks 50%, more than 50% in applied water, but we saw it in water infrastructure too. You're now seeing us return to utility activity and quoting \u2013 bidding activity that's returned to pre-COVID levels in China. So that's an encouraging sign that our teams have seen. Albeit they're working through what life looks like after the pandemic where those meetings have changed, a lot of it is virtual, a lot of it is less people than previously done. So we're getting back that. We're starting to learn what that's going to look like for even our European and US businesses, but there's a bit of learning that we've had from the China side. Good morning. It's a great question. I think the \u2013 so what we've already seen and again, I step back globally. I'll come to the US here in a second. As Matt mentioned, we're already seeing recovery in China. It is lagging the utility side because it's less essential and critical, but it is returning to normality there. And we expect that to be the case, certainly following in Europe and then eventually here in the US. The part of our business right now that's been most heavily impacted is the bucket ship business in the US that was especially hard hit in the northeast in California, where you had the hot spots of COVID-19. The rest of the business is actually held up fairly well in that regard, but it's been very steep in those COVID-19 hotspots. So we do expect and again, as I mentioned earlier, it's not necessarily in all cases where we go direct, it's also the impact it's had on our channel partners, and their ability to be at work. And the feedback that we get from them is that they do still see quoting activity continuing on jobs, it is happening remotely similar to what we see in China. I think we all can kind of relate to that. So that always slows things down a little bit in terms of jobs getting completed, in terms of bid. But we do expect there to be a reasonably strong recovery. But I do think it's going to be prolonged for some period, as things just take a little bit longer to get done as people are working remotely. So I don't think it's going to be a big snapback, it's not going to be a V shape. At least we're not guiding that way at this point. But I just want to make sure everybody understands. It is very much isolated to certain hot spots around the US. It's not a broad based commentary on commercial channel. And backlogs are up. And we \u2013 the approach we took on this was to get on it \u2013 as soon as we heard about it, get on it now, like get it behind us, do what we got to do to take care of those customers and move on and that's why we took the charge in the quarter and we're confident that as Mark said, it's very contained. It's an isolated piece of the business, certain number of endpoints. And our customers have responded very positively in terms of the way that we've gotten on it. Yeah. Tony are you still on? And one of the things \u2013 and one of the learnings that we had coming out of China that I think we didn't mention in our prepared remarks, and I don't think Tony mentioned earlier was, as we saw, again, following the viruses, we saw things moving around the world, one of the things that we did was go ahead and begin to build up inventory in certain factories to get ahead of it, to make sure that we could at least try to minimize supply disruption and just absorb demand flowing, but be able to be prepared for that. And that certainly was also the case in our India factories, the two that we have there. Yes. Yeah. I mean, I think our comment there really \u2013 I think the intention of Mark's comment was not that there wouldn't be deals to be done or there won't be activity at all. I think it just \u2013 it always moves things out a little bit more to the right, as people will try to figure out kind of what is the appropriate valuation for their asset and then you can take the time to do the diligence, as Mark pointed. So we're not rushing out, but at the same time, we are very open. Again, our strategy remains unchanged there. We'll be smart about it, both in terms of the pace and the valuations, but you're absolutely right, again, there's a flight to quality and again the strong get stronger in these timeframes. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks, everybody for joining. Again, as we like to say here, stay safe, stay strong, stay focused. We appreciate your time here with us today. I look forward to getting back in touch with you."

            "content": "I am on. Are we talking about the supply chain disruption as a result of the warranty issue or just overall the \u2013 The virus \u2013 the virus you're talking \u2013 Yeah. Sure. Yeah, we did, we had a number of components, particularly in electronics that came in from China that were disrupted for a short period of time. We also had one COVID case there that shut the factory down for a couple of days. So now up and running and that person's back at work, and we're \u2013 that supply chain issue is behind us now. Sure, yeah. So our current capacity globally is about 90%. Our China facility was \u2013 facilities were down for about 10 days after Chinese New Year before they came back. In the first week, they were back at about half capacity. And now they're back up to 100%. And they're fully loaded right now. A lot of pent up demand, as Patrick mentioned, is coming back into some of the China facilities right now. Some of the lessons that we've learned were around communication, around safety and safety has been a stronghold for us for many years now. We've cut our incident rate down by 50% over the last four or five years and this has really been elevated. So temperature checks, PPE, social distancing and we've learned quite a bit from that model. And we're able to deploy that a lot quicker. In Italy, for instance, where we saw really no production downtime, we got low, but we never shut down the facility. And in fact, in our 50 facilities around the world, only one of those is shut down right now, which is in India. In fact the other Indian facilities are actually up and running from last week. So putting those safety measures in place, that communication measures in place have really helped us keep our employees healthy and the fact that we're all in deemed essential services almost everywhere as allowed our facilities to stay up and running. Yeah. So first of all, we have two facilities in India. One of the facilities is \u2013 we've been able to get it deemed in essential service and that actually opened up last week. I think the latest lockdown actually has pushed it out to May 15 and so our other facility will remain shut down through May 15. But the first facility, our larger facility actually was opened up last week."

            "name": "Mark Rajkowski",
            "content": "Thanks Patrick. Please turn to Slide 6. First, I'd like to give a big shout out on incredible teams working tirelessly to support our customers, whether working remotely, in our factories or in the field. Thanks to all of you. Now, let's turn to the first quarter results. Organic revenues declined 8% in the quarter, of that we believe COVID-19 ultimately had about a 5% impact on organic revenue growth for the quarter. The market softness we anticipated played out largely as expected until mid-March when we saw a sudden and broad impact as the pandemic spread from China to Europe and North America. From an end market perspective, industrial, commercial and residential markets each declined double digits, driven somewhat by expected underlying market softness, but more significantly by the impact of COVID-19 as factories, supply chains and customer operations were subject to shut down around the world. Utilities end market declined 5% as some project work was delayed, but operations and maintenance spending remain relatively steady. Geographically, all major regions declined in the quarter. Western Europe fared relatively well with growth in several countries in the first two months of the quarter. Emerging Markets declined double digits, including a 35% year-over-year decline in China due to mandatory shutdowns. US was down 7% on broad weakness with utilities showing the most resilience. Overall orders were down 2% with growth in utilities offset by declines in the other end markets. However excluding the estimated impact of the spreading pandemic, orders for the company would have grown low single digits in the quarter. Operating margins declined to 6.2%, driven mainly by COVID-19 related volume impacts, and warranty charge in the measurement and control solutions segment which I'll discuss shortly. Earnings per share is $0.23, this includes roughly $0.09 of impact from the pandemic and $0.07 from the warranty charge. Please turn to Slide 7 and I'll review Q1 results by segment. Water infrastructure orders in the first quarter were down 1% organically versus last year. We saw orders growth in the utilities markets more than offset by declines in the industrial side of the business. Organic revenues declined 7% in the quarter. The utilities end market was down 4% organically, while industrial was down double digits led by a 13% decline in the water, driven by volume declines in the oil and gas, construction and mining verticals. We consider the water infrastructure segment to be a proxy for the wastewater portion of the business with exposure to sewer collection networks and treatment processes. Historically, we've seen most utilities protect their operations and maintenance spending budgets during downturns, and we expect this behavior to continue. Please turn to Slide 8. The applied water segment had 5% organic orders decline despite very steady quote activity during the quarter. We're monitoring this metric very closely with our channel partners as well as order cancellations and project delivery delays. And while we haven't experienced any order cancellations, we are seeing some delays in project activity, as our customers were impacted by construction site closures and distancing mandates. Organic revenue declined 10% as the short cycle softness we had expected in our industrial and commercial end markets was exacerbated by the significant impact of project delays and construction site closures driven by COVID-19, most notably in China, which was down over 50% versus last year. Despite the significant impact of lower volumes and absorption from temporary factory closures on operating margins, the team was largely able to offset these impacts with an impressive 460 basis points of productivity and cost savings. Now, please turn to Slide 9. Measurement and control solution segment revenues were down 7% organically in the quarter, primarily driven by the effects of the pandemic, including water project deployment delays, and the impact from supply chain disruptions in our test business. Lower meter replacement demand was also affected beginning in March as physical distance requirements are impacting utilities ability and capacity to perform this work. Orders within the segment declined 3% organically, along with some softness in our recurring meter replacement revenue. We're also beginning to see some utilities choose to postpone project bidding, or delay issuing decisions on project awards. We're keeping in close communication with our utility customers and channel partners to understand their operational challenges. So we can best support them and effectively manage our supply chain. Segment margins in the quarter were significantly impacted by a $15 million warranty charge. This relates to a specific firmware issue and is contained to a limited number of our North American Water customers. The issue was quickly identified and is now being addressed in partnership with our customers. This charge impacted segment operating margins by roughly 430 basis points in the quarter. The impacts from COVID-19 related to lower demand and the availability of key components was approximately 110 basis points in the quarter. Now, please turn to Slide 10 for a discussion on the company's financial position and liquidity. We closed the quarter with a cash balance of $739 million. During the quarter we invested $51 million in CapEx for critical projects and we returned $108 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases to manage dilution. Our free cash flow performance in the quarter was impacted by lower net income and a higher use of cash for working capital. While working capital as a percentage of sales improved 70 basis points over the first quarter of 2019, cash used for working capital in the first quarter this year reflects both the timing of accounts payable, as well as higher inventories due to lower than expected sales. We remain laser focused on cash flow performance and are tracking cash flows and working capital daily. That said we do expect increases in past due receivables as we support key customers and channel partners through this period. We continue to have a strong liquidity position with approximately $1.7 billion available. In this past week we signed two bilateral loan agreements providing $160 million of borrowing capacity at attractive rates. We're confident that our strong financial position, our liquidity and focus on cash flow will enable us to effectively manage through this crisis and support the critical investments needed to enable our long-term profitable growth. With that, I'll hand it back to Patrick. Thank you. Yeah, I think in Q2, what we're seeing based upon order trends, and what we're hearing from customers, the businesses that are being impacted unfortunately are some of the richest in terms of margin profile. So dewatering for example is certainly at the top of that list, in terms of margins and year-over-year impact. And we're seeing some of the same in our test business, which is very rich margins as well as in the North American Water side of the business for M&CS, so all of those are very rich in terms of the margin mix. But to Patrick's point, what it looks like going forward is a function of that mix volumes, but also, we will see benefit on the cost side that'll be reflected. Yeah. Hey, Deane, it's Mark. There's a couple of pieces to it. One is you nailed it relative to the impact on some of the deployments. And you mentioned one specifically, but there are others out there. And it's also \u2013 to the point you made, having some impact relative to that just the ability to physically go in and do some of that work. And the utilities are really focused on critical repair issues at this point. So not that this isn't important work and won't continue. But it's certainly been pushed out as less essential. And some of the other things we need to deal with. I would say the \u2013 I think we really look at it on an end market basis and as we think about utilities, we're expecting to see on the top line down mid 20s including and that would include the clean water side with M&CS. In terms of industrial that's probably going to be down closer to 30%. And think of a big part of that that's going to be led by dewatering. Okay. And that's embedded in the transport, business in the water infrastructure business. And then commercial is going to be close to 20%, 20% plus and resi down about 30. But in terms of the margin by segment, I think water infrastructure will probably be the most resilient, I would say, followed by AWS and with some of the challenges we just talked about on the clean water side, probably M&CS a little bit more severe. Yeah, Nathan, let me let me start and give you a little bit of color on the 100 million. That breaks down roughly $40 million of reductions in CapEx, both was critical as well as just less need for certain capacity because of the demand. But also, we're focused on taking out roughly $60 million of OpEx spend and it's not so much focused on employees, it's focused on spending that we're doing outside, consultants, professional services, et cetera. Sure, yeah. Morning, but I would start by saying, we do enter this with a very, very strong both cash position, but liquidity broadly. We are going to continue focusing on those areas that \u2013 our highest returning which is continuing to fund the investments we need to grow the business. We talked about that earlier, in response to Deane's question, that it's important that we maintain those critical investments to grow over the long-term. Secondly, given our liquidity position, and there's not \u2013 let's face it, I mean, deals are not going to get done in the near term, but we are going to be focused on keep \u2013 our ear to the ground. We know where we want to play. We know we want to participate. And we have our list out there and at the right time, we think we'll be well positioned to take advantage. I would say Tony and his team have done a tremendous job in terms of the supply chain, making sure we've got good visibility into critical components and supply from Tier 1, Tier 2 suppliers as well. So that's been very helpful. Yeah, that would certainly be the plan. With some of the impact on volume we'll release some working capital, but we're also mindful of the fact that it's some of our customers are under stress. So we need to be on top of collecting our receivable. Some of our key customers and channel partners are under stress, so we're going to look to support them, but on the whole, as volumes decline, you'd see some release of working capital for sure. Yeah, it's, as I said, it's a firmware issue, it's very contained. It's really in a relatively small part of our business. It's in our AMR side, which is the vast majority of our businesses, AMI, FlexNet and other things. So it does not impact FlexNet customers' international business, it's not electric or gas, so fairly contained. They've identified the issue and they're working through with customers right now. So it's very much contained."

Now please turn to slide 3 and I will turn the call over to our CEO, Patrick Decker.\nPatrick Decker: Thanks, Matt and good morning, everyone. As we indicated in our release this morning, the team delivered a strong operational performance in the fourth quarter meeting or exceeding our expectations across all major metrics. Despite the challenges that 2021 presented us especially in the second half, I'm very proud of the team for what they did to deliver on our commitments. And as a team they delivered a very strong full year performance. This was reflected by mid single-digit organic revenue growth, solid EBITDA margin expansion of 80 basis points and adjusted earnings per share growth of 21%. And orders grew 23% for the year and in the fourth quarter giving us very strong momentum coming into 2022. We posted our strongest orders growth in our M&CS segment. And it reflects the need and desire of our customers for digital solutions to address their growing needs around water affordability and infrastructure resilience. Our Water Infrastructure and Applied Water segments also posted very strong orders growth for the year and the fourth quarter demonstrating the healthy demand across our portfolio. We continue to experience very strong underlying demand globally with double-digit orders growth across all regions and we expect that momentum to continue throughout 2022 and beyond. And our investments in R&D are clearly paying off enabling us to win market share due to the customer value we're creating. And our investments in geographic coverage have made significant contributions to our overall growth especially in emerging markets where we posted double-digit revenue growth in 2021. Of course, the other side of the story in 2021 was the constrained supply chain challenges of the second half along with inflation that really accelerated in the last quarter. As we anticipated in our last conference call, the severe chip shortage affecting the entire tech sector held back our ability to convert such strong orders into revenue, especially in our M&CS segment. Against that backdrop, the team did an excellent job managing what we can control, bringing discretionary costs down below 2020 levels and taking aggressive pricing actions to mitigate inflationary pressures. In fact, price realization in the fourth quarter was modestly higher than our expectations, and we expect to offset inflation further as we deliver accretive margins in our backlogs. So despite all of the year's headwinds the team not only delivered solid operational results but they did it with heart and purpose. Along the way we made significant progress towards our 2025 signature sustainability goals. One example of that is that the team set a Xylem record for hours volunteered to solve water challenges in our communities around the world. It's a privilege, to be a part of a team with that level of commitment to our mission. Now looking ahead to 2022, we see continued strong demand for our products and solutions, strong fundamentals across our business in terms of productivity and free cash flow conversion, and continued ability to drive price as a market leader to offset inflationary pressures. Nevertheless, our outlook is tempered by the reality of a prolonged chip shortage, limiting the speed at which we can convert orders to revenue. So we are being balanced in our guidance, based upon the visibility we have. Our guidance assumes modest and gradual increases in chip supply in the second half and into 2023. And as volumes return, we expect to realize significant margin expansion consistent with the first half of this past year when we operate in a less chip constrained environment in M&CS. And we see this in the backlog margins we have coming into 2022. In the second half of this year growth in margin expansion both gross margin and EBITDA are expected to return to levels that put us on track to deliver on the 2025 strategic and financial framework that we outlined last September at our Investor Day. In a moment, we'll discuss the assumptions in our 2022 outlook, and speak to our intentions for capital deployment given the strength of our financial and competitive position. But first, I'm going to hand it over to Sandy to dig in briefly on the quarter's results before we turn back to 2022.\nSandy Rowland: Thanks Patrick. Please turn to slide 4, and I'll cover our fourth quarter results. As Patrick indicated, significant chip shortages impacting the utilities end-market in the U.S. more than, offset utilities growth in Europe and strong growth in the Industrial segment globally. Given the quarter's challenges, the team did an outstanding job delivering on our commitments and increasingly tough circumstances with particularly strong performance on price and discipline on costs. In a moment I'll give you a detailed performance by segment. But in short, utilities was down 9% a result of supply chain constraints acutely impacting our smart metering business in the U.S. Industrial grew 7%, on sustained strength in China and healthy activity in the U.S. Commercial was up modestly at 1% and residential was down 4% on challenging comparisons in the prior year when we grew mid-teens. Organic orders were up 23% in the quarter as demand for our technologies continues to be healthy across all segments. EBITDA margin was 16.2% which was within our guided range. Year-over-year EBITDA margin contracted 260 basis points as productivity savings and strong price realization benefits were more than offset by inflation mix and strategic investments. We continue to invest for example in geographic market coverage to serve increasing demand and enhanced digital capabilities across the portfolio. Our EPS in the quarter was $0.63. And please turn to slide 5, and I'll review the quarter's segment performance in a bit more detail. Water Infrastructure orders in the fourth quarter were up 30% organically versus last year. That includes a project cancellation last year in India, which we discussed on a previous call. Otherwise, orders were up mid-single digits. This order's pace reflects resilient demand in our Wastewater Utility business in the U.S. and Europe as well as increasing demand for dewatering particularly in emerging markets. Water Infrastructure revenue was up modestly in the quarter. Healthy growth in Industrial was partly offset by a small decline in our Wastewater Utility business in the U.S. where order to revenue conversion was challenged by long ocean transit times. Geographically, results were mixed for the segment. The U.S. and Western Europe were up low-single digits and mid-single digits respectively. Healthy treatment deliveries in both geographies were offset by the delays I just mentioned. Emerging markets was down low single digits, largely due to an especially strong performance in China last year. EBITDA margin for the segment was down 50 basis points as significant savings from productivity and cost reductions were offset by inflation and strategic investments. Please turn to page 6. In the Applied Water segment orders were up 10% organically in the quarter, driven by healthy demand in all geographies. Revenues increased 3% with high single-digit growth in industrial and a modest increase in commercial, partially offset by sales down mid-single digits in residential. Geographically the US was up high single digits. Growth in all end-markets was led by ongoing industrial recovery. Emerging markets was up mid-single digits on continuing industrial strength in China and momentum in Eastern Europe. Western Europe delivered low single-digits growth with moderate gains balanced across all end-markets. Segment EBITDA margin declined 340 basis points in the quarter. Material and freight inflation more than offset solid productivity gains and accelerating price realization. And now let's turn to slide 7 and I'll cover our Measurement & Control Solutions business. M&CS orders grew 28% organically in the quarter, reflecting strong demand for our metrology solutions as well as healthy demand across all other applications in this segment including test and pipeline assessment services. This puts our M&CS backlog up 63% versus the prior year. As we anticipated, revenue declined 17% due to constrained chip supply. It's worth noting that the growing metrology backlog is both resilient and margin accretive. There have been no cancellations of AMI contracts and we expect large project deployments will resume in the back half of the year as component supply becomes available. Geographically, US revenues were down 21%. Western Europe and emerging markets declined more modestly at 10% and 2%, respectively from pockets of growth in our water quality test business. Segment EBITDA margin in the quarter was down 750 basis points. Volume was the biggest factor as this business gets very strong operating leverage from higher revenues, which were constrained by the lower conversion of orders. Those volume effects along with higher inflation were partially offset by productivity gains and cost discipline. And now let's turn to slide 8 for an overview of cash flows and the company's financial position. Our financial position remains robust as we exit the year with $1.3 billion in cash and available liquidity of more than $2 billion. Net debt-to-EBITDA leverage is 1.2 times. After delivering free cash flow conversion of 181% last year, our free cash flow conversion was 77% in 2021, slightly below our target for the year. While our team made continued progress driving collections, we consciously increased our inventory safety stocks in the second half of the year to mitigate supply chain volatility but we remain committed to at least 100% conversion over the cycle. A further item of note. As we previously advised, we are derisking our balance sheet with the buyout of our largest defined pension plan in the UK. We expect to finalize this transfer in 2022, at which point we'll recognize a non-cash charge of approximately $170 million, primarily consisting of unrecognized actuarial losses, which are reflected in equity today. Lastly, in line with our capital allocation framework. Today we announced an increase in our annual dividend of 7% and that is our 11th consecutive annual increase. Please turn to slide 9 and I'll hand back to Patrick to look forward at 2022.\nPatrick Decker: Thanks Sandy. We see strong demand continuing through 2022 and strong fundamentals in all our businesses. On the other hand, the reality is that supply constraints will continue to be an important and not entirely predictable variable. So we are reflecting a responsible set of assumptions in our guidance, while working aggressively to improve the situation. We anticipate chip availability will improve for the year, but not linearly and not all at once. In the first half, shortages are still likely to hold back conversion of orders to revenue with disproportionate impact on our higher-margin solutions. So we'll be focused on operating with discipline, driving price productivity and cost during what we foresee being a transitory period. In the second half of the year, supply should begin to improve modestly and the pace of chip shipments will have a determining effect on our growth rate and margin expansion. As components begin to come through, the margin upside is highly accretive to our margin profile. The positive side of this dynamic was apparent in the first half of 2021 when chip supply did not limit M&CS growth and we saw margin expansion of more than 500 basis points in the portfolio. Given the size and growth of our metrology backlogs, it's worth expanding on a point Sandy made a moment ago about the resilience of those backlogs. Large AMI projects are not easily substituted and they offer a compelling business case for our customers, particularly as they are addressing issues of affordability and regulatory commitments. Our utility customers often spend years in pilot testing, approval and procurement to determine these solutions. So despite these near-term delays, we do not anticipate backlog erosion. Turning to slide 10. You can see our focus areas for 2022, which will keep us aligned to our long-term financial framework. The team is managing through the current challenges with great discipline, working with both suppliers and customers. Even though we expect chip supply will gradually improve in the second half we don't anticipate suppliers will be able to serve 100% of our requirements given the sheer size of our order books. So we're working with our most critical supply partner to accelerate redesign options and we're staying close to our customers to prioritize serving their most mission-critical needs. Since visibility about the likely rate of improvement is imperfect, we're also phasing our ongoing strategic investments with an eye on leading indicators of supply recovery. Now, before I turn to Sandy for more detail on our outlook, I want to comment briefly on capital deployment. We're coming into the year with a strong balance sheet and more than $2 billion in liquidity. So, M&A naturally comes to mind as a strategic accelerator for sustained growth and margin expansion. And those of you who've been with us a while, you know that we're not hesitant to do a deal when there's a good deal to be done in service of advancing the company's overall strategy. And our view is that there are opportunities for strategic value creation in the marketplace for a company like us with our financial strength and sector leadership. But we will continue to be disciplined and selective with an eye towards significant value creation. Now, I'll turn it back over to Sandy for more on our outlook.\nSandy Rowland: Thanks, Patrick. We expect underlying demand will continue to be healthy through 2022. However, as Patrick just described, business conditions aren't likely to normalize on an entirely predictable path. So we've taken a view of the year that reflects those dynamics, balancing external constraints and potential upsides. We anticipate our utility business overall which is just north of 50% of Xylem revenues will grow low-single-digits in 2022. On the wastewater side, we expect low-single-digit to mid-single-digit growth as we see a continuation of resilient global demand. We anticipate strong demand in emerging markets, driven by considerable investment in public utilities, increasing OpEx activity as well as the benefit of our localization strategy. The outlook for longer-term capital project spending and bid activity is very solid globally. On the clean water side, we anticipate revenues will be flat. Demand remains robust but deliveries will be constrained by chip shortages mentioned earlier. We foresee healthy momentum in our test and assessment services businesses due to increasing focus on infrastructure and climate challenges. And now, please turn to slide 12. Looking at the Industrial end market, we expect to grow mid-single-digits on steady demand for our solutions globally. We continue to see healthy growth in dewatering, especially in emerging markets from increasing mining demand and benefiting from our localization strategies. In the US and Western Europe, we expect solid order rates and backlog expansion as activity ramps in light industrial applications. The Commercial end market should deliver mid-single-digit growth on solid replacement business in the US as well as acceleration of institutional construction. In Europe, we see increased construction activity, driven by the rise in funding for green buildings, driving demand for our new eco-friendly product offerings in that space. In residential, our smallest end-market, we are expecting low single-digit to mid-single-digit growth with healthy demand. And now, let's turn to Slide 13, and I'll walk you through our updated guidance. For Xylem overall, we foresee full year 2022 organic revenue growth in the range of 3% to 5% with flat revenues in the first half and high single-digit growth in the second half. This breaks down by segment as follows: Mid-single-digit growth in Water Infrastructure with solid growth in both Wastewater Utilities and Industrial. Mid-single-digit growth in Applied Water from solid mid-single-digit growth in Industrial and Commercial applications and low to mid-single-digit growth in residential. We expect Measurement & Control Solutions to be flattish. As Patrick mentioned earlier, this assumes down double-digits in this half of the year and up double-digits in the second half. Although growth is still likely to be partially constrained by the gradual return of chip supply as the second half progresses. Despite that partial recoverability and the availability of chips, volumes and margins will remain supply constrained. The constraint will have an unfavorable impact on volume and mix more than offsetting the benefits of price realization and productivity savings through the year. For 2022, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of 16% to 17%. In the first half of the year, we anticipate EBITDA will be approximately 14% to 15%, bouncing back to 18% to 19% in the second half. And this puts EBITDA in the second half in line with the long-term targets we laid out at Investor Day. This yields an adjusted EPS range of $2.35 to $2.70. Free cash flow conversion is expected to be at least 100% of net income. We have provided you with other full year assumptions on this slide to supplement your models. We're assuming a euro to dollar conversion rate of 1.13 and as foreign exchange can be volatile, our FX sensitivity table is included in the appendix. And now drilling down in the first quarter, we anticipate total company organic revenues will be in the range of flat to up 2%. This includes mid-single-digit growth in Water Infrastructure and Applied Water and M&CS is expected to decline low double-digits. We expect first quarter adjusted EBITDA margin to be in the range of 13.5% to 14% impacted by higher inflation and supply chain challenges. We expect this will be the low point in adjusted EBITDA in the year with accelerating sequential quarterly improvement. And with that please turn to Slide 14 and I'll turn the call back over to Patrick for closing comments. \nPatrick Decker: Thanks, Sandy. We're coming into 2022 in a strong and enviable position. The market demand for our solutions and technologies has never been greater. We have strong commercial momentum with very strong orders growth and high-margin backlogs that prove our conviction about the investments we've been making and our customers need and appetite and the foundation and flexibility of a powerful balance sheet giving us strategic options in a dynamic marketplace. In the short term of course, no one likes being constrained by externalities. But we have strong resolve and operating discipline and fully expect to deliver a year of results on track with our 2025 strategic and financial goals and that are aligned to our overall investment thesis, that of being a technology leader with a durable business model, bringing differentiated offerings to a market of rising demand for sustainable water solutions, committed to driving above-market growth and margin expansion as our portfolio continues to digitize and to accelerating value creation with disciplined active capital allocation. So now operator, I'll turn the call over to you for questions.\nOperator: The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nDeane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nPatrick Decker: Hey. Good morning, Dean. How are you doing?\nSandy Rowland: Good morning, Dean.\nDeane Dray: Really well. Thanks. Look, since it's the biggest swing factor in your guidance the chip shortage and it didn't sound like you have Tony on the line this quarter, but I had some questions that -- if we can go into a little more detail on the shortage situation. And again, this gets a bit more technical. But can you give us color between your shortages on the microprocessor side which typically you can get substitutes and alternative sources versus microcontrollers, which are so much more tied to firmware and it's really hard to substitute and redesign. So the extent to which that could be helpful is there a distinction there in terms of shortages and both and when you expect to get recovery in those two-class of chips?\nPatrick Decker: Sure. Certainly, Deane. Great question. So you've nailed it. If we look at our supply chain challenges right now, 80% of the issue roughly is microcontrollers. And I'll come back in a moment to what we're doing there to try to mitigate that as best we can. And we can also talk about what we're doing to make sure that we hold on to the backlog that we've got right now which has really attractive margins in it. But the 20% that is more on the microprocessing side, we face those challenges in Q4 and the team did a terrific job on substitution, really going out into the open market and broad distribution and really helped us mitigate that. Otherwise we would have really had a bigger hit in Q4 than what we mitigated, now really is about the microcontroller. So, what we're doing there, we are partnering with our suppliers on redesign. And there what we're doing is we're redesigning along with where they see future designs going across the broader technology sector. But those really -- those impacts really aren't going to hit us until -- or benefit us until probably Q4 going into '23 because it is a lead time. We are doing alternate sourcing and that's certainly helping us buffer some of the demand here. And we're also resurrecting some of our legacy meters as a bridge in some of these larger AMI implementations to go ahead and get these projects started. Lastly, I would say on the large AMI deals, what we work with our customers on is they've really been encouraged by us going out and beginning to build out the comm side the communication side. So we get the products going. And we've also opened up them to have the opportunity to go out and use alternate meters. And honestly, Deane, they've come back to us because, they realize, they believe in the value proposition, they see what we're doing here and they want to be with us. So, we're working it every day. We feel good about where we are in terms of protecting backlog and the team is all over this in terms of what we can do to mitigate the chip supply situation.\nDeane Dray: All right. I'm glad I asked to that level of detail because, a couple often times you just say chip shortage and move on. But...\nPatrick Decker: Deane, on that point also, Deane, just to give you a feel for kind of how things are going with our suppliers right now. We had a number of de-commits from our large suppliers in Q4. Those de-commits have ceased. We haven't had a de-commit for quite some time now. They've actually been delivering on forecast. And the lead times, while they are still very lengthy, I mean we had lead times up to 78 weeks on some of our key components here. Those have moved down modestly, but the good news is they're moving in the right direction.\nDeane Dray: Got it. And I appreciate the color on the not losing share or having cancellations within the meter backlog. So that's real helpful. And just the follow-up question, this has come up a couple of different times and ways in this call is, you've booked the 23% organic order growth, which is really healthy and gives you that longer-term look. And you've said that the implied margin are healthy or accretive. I just wonder, what base margin are you comparing that to? And just the extent to which we're all looking at what the 2025 target is? And so, how would the -- where is your booking now compare on profitability either this year or for next year? Thanks.\nSandy Rowland: Yes. Great question, Deane. The momentum that we have on the orders front is really, really strong and it's broad-based across our portfolio. So when I'll start with more of our book and ship businesses in AWS and water infrastructure, there we know that we've taken price actions throughout 2021. And actually we've taken some incremental price actions already in 2022. And so we know that those orders that we recently secured are going to be more competitive and balanced against the inflation headwinds that we're facing. When we think about the longer-term large AMI contracts, most of those contracts have inflation adjusters, which are tied to CPI. And so that -- while those -- all of those won't be delivered in 2022, it's going to take us some time once we get back to good flow on the chip side to clear out that backlog, but those price resets will help protect the margin. And when we think about those large AMI deals where we're looking at gross margins above 40%.\nPatrick Decker: Yes, incremental margins. \nDeane Dray: Real helpful. Thank you.\nPatrick Decker: Thank you, Deane.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Nathan Jones with Stifel. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nNathan Jones: Good morning everyone.\nPatrick Decker: Hey, Nate. How are you doing?\nSandy Rowland: Good morning Nate.\nNathan Jones: Very well, thanks. Very well, thanks. I want to start off just talking a little bit about price versus inflation. I think the disclosure for this quarter registration at 560 basis points in price at 200 basis points. I'm a little surprised you aren't able to capture more price and close that gap a little bit to inflation, given demand is very strong given customers across industry have been conditioned to expect price increases at the moment. Are there opportunities for you to be not just a little bit more aggressive on price, but significantly more aggressive on price to close that gap? \nSandy Rowland: Yes. I think really good question Nate. The inflation rate certainly picked up on us in Q4. So when we look at sort of exit -- when we look at overall inflation for 2021, it was in the 8% range. And when we exited Q4, it bumped up to about 12%. So that was a meaningful increase and it actually outpaced what we had incorporated into our guide. On the flip side, we did get some more price in the fourth quarter than we had modeled and so they kind of netted, which is why we came in with EBITDA margins in line with our forecast.\nPatrick Decker: And so Nate what I would offer up here is as we -- it really is a story of momentum. So to Sandy's point we were very aggressive on price in Q4 and continue to be. And our price/cost is going to be positive as we go into Q2. We weren't able to go in and reprice all of our backlog. We repriced some of it, but we're going to be price cost positive in Q2. That really ramps in the back half of 2022. And for the full year we are going to be price/cost positive for the full year.\nNathan Jones: That's very encouraging. \nPatrick Decker: The teams have done a great job on the pricing front.\nNathan Jones: Thanks. Cancellations you talked about, no cancellations on the AMI side of the metering business. Have you seen cancellations on more of the replacement side or losing some share on the replacement side? I understand the differences between your business and some competitive businesses. Maybe you could explain those differences a little bit. Their results -- Badger had 20-odd percent meter growth. Neptune had double-digit meter growth. Can you talk a little bit more about what the differences between those businesses are more attacking your side of it, I think, contributes to it. Just the differences there that are resulting in that differentiated procurement. \nPatrick Decker: Sure. So Nate, yes, so perhaps what I can do is just spend a moment on explaining kind of the metering market. So you've got two different types of meters. You've got static, which is really kind of where the market is going that's where the market overall is going. Our competitors are also moving that direction and then you have the mechanical kind of traditional meters, which we certainly have those, but it's a much smaller portion of our portfolio. The benefits of static versus mechanical from our view and certainly customers view is static meters are more accurate over the life of the meter. You have less moving parts in a static meter, you're able to build in other kind of bells and whistles like advanced alarms around link detection. And obviously, with the data that it's able to gather helps around non-revenue water. So there's a lot of kind of economic and environmental value and that's why the industry is moving towards static. We are further along in that move. And so as a result of that, we are more exposed to chips because the microcontroller really is the brain, of that static meter. And so to your question around, kind of the day-to-day replacement business, to be honest we have seen some customers that have gone back to traditional to say \"Hey it's good enough right now.\" But that's only transitory. And even we are resurrecting, our old mechanical meters to help bridge that time that we're there. Most importantly, on these larger signature wins, again these large AMI deals, which are really the indicator of where the market is going. We've not lost those. And if anything we've seen -- we're still winning deals in that environment because the value proposition is so strong and so robust. And again, what we're focusing on right now is, making sure we get the communications platform in place to really secure those and move those forward. \nNathan Jones: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I\u2019ll pass it on.\nPatrick Decker: Thank you, Nathan.\nMatt Latino: Thank you, Nathan.\nOperator: Next question comes from Bryan Blair with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Your line is open. \nBryan Blair: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions.\nPatrick Decker: Good morning, Bryan\nSandy Rowland: Good morning.\nBryan Blair: I was hoping you could offer a little more color on dewatering trends. You highlighted the strength in international markets specifically emerging markets. I'm curious about the relative growth of equipment sales versus rental. The stronger drop-through on the latter? And what's contemplated in your guidance for that business, specifically? \nSandy Rowland: So good question. I think we have seen increasing momentum in dewatering, as we move throughout the year. And in fourth quarter overall, we saw high single-digit growth. We actually saw growth in all of our markets but especially strong momentum coming in emerging markets because of strong mining demand. Really, it was on both fronts the rental front and the equipment sales front both showed positive signs. We've taken some steps this year to invest a little bit more on the CapEx side to refresh our fleet. And we expect to see some positive benefits from that as we go into 2022. \nPatrick Decker: Yes. Bryan one of the things -- on that last point, one of the things that we had done when we were in the down cycle in that business, we were curtailing some of our CapEx to protect margins and just see kind of stabilize that business. Now we really see there being opportunity that is, we invest even just a little bit more in the fleet and from a CapEx perspective That traditionally has yielded very positive returns, both from a growth and a margins perspective. And we don't have all that built into our guide but we do see a strong recovery there. \nBryan Blair: I appreciate the color. And as a follow-up focusing specifically on the US market. Just curious how your team is thinking about the potential catalyst from infrastructure spending. There are other areas of your business that I guess somewhat naturally get more attention on that front. But I would imagine the tailwinds for general construction activity, commodity demand would read through pretty nicely perhaps more of a 2023, 2024 catalyst but any color on that front would be helpful. \nPatrick Decker: Yes, certainly. You're right we don't have any of that built into our guide for 2022. It really is -- and we didn't really even have anything built in meaningfully into our outline of kind of long-range, objectives in our Investor Day because we always talked about that being a possible support mechanism. So it is at 2023 and beyond. But yes, just some specifics on this. I know others have commented both positive and maybe not so positive on when it's going to happen.  Our view is we're talking about $66 billion of investment in a critical Water Infrastructure. 80% of that is going to be administered by the EPA, who we have very strong relationships with at the highest levels. Nearly half of the 193 programs that are funded in this bill, contain commercial opportunities for Xylem. It is more than a one or two-year thing. It really spans over several years. So, there clearly are commercial opportunities there. But again, they're not in our outlook but we are net positive on the trends that we're seeing right now, and the conversations we're having with customers. \nBryan Blair: Understood. I appreciate the detail there. I was -- perhaps remiss. I was referring specifically to the dewatering outlook, but I understand there are broad-based prospective tailwinds?\nPatrick Decker: Yeah. No. I think \u2013 I think the areas that it would be most impactful for us would really be in predominantly three specific areas. It would be certainly dewatering on the construction side, you would see it in our water infrastructure business on the treatment side most notably. We'd also see it on the clean water side, as we're talking about the \u2013 addressing non-revenue water through some of our solutions there. And then there would be an ancillary benefit even on our commercial building and industrial side in Applied Water, where you've got a knock-on effect of some of this infrastructure demand. But it's really going to be predominantly in dewatering treatment and the clean water side?\nBryan Blair: Helpful color. Thanks, again.\nPatrick Decker: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Ryan Connors with Boenning and Scattergood. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nRyan Connors: Great. Thanks for taking my question.\nPatrick Decker: Sure.\nRyan Connors: I wanted to just look at the M&CS from a bigger picture standpoint. And I think, it's fully recognized that supply chain has been a big challenge. But really, if you look back the M&CS profitability issues really predated the pandemic and the supply chain issues. I mean, if you look back at some of the press release and commentary from 2018 and 2019. I mean, that business has been sort of a drag on profitability for a long time. So is \u2013 I'm wondering, what your perspective is on that? And is part of the takeaway that it's not a great business in normal times and it's \u2013 we see it's a really bad business when things get tough, or I mean what's the longer picture looking back at the pre-COVID challenges in M&CS?\nPatrick Decker: Sure, Ryan. Fair question. I look at the proof points of this business and that is I look at the backlog, so I look at the investments we made I look at the deals that, we've won, I look at the margin profile of those deals in the backlog. I look at the margin profile of even our repair replacement business, and it is very attractive. I look back at the first half of 2021, where we demonstrated even mid-single-digit growth. And we showed 500 basis points of margin expansion from an EBITDA standpoint during that time frame. Have we been \u2013 have we had our licks and our knocks over the last few years, absolutely, whether it be a battery supplier having a fire, whether it be trade conflicts. Now, we have the impacts of chip shortages. Yes, that is the nature unfortunately of us being in a technology leaning business, but the proof points are there. The investments that we've made are paying off in terms of demand, margin profile, and we love this business. And we \u2013 again, we're guiding responsibly this year. We want to give you a balanced view. And even within that balance view look at the margin profile of what we're committing to in the second half of the year, and that is right in track and right on line with what we laid out in Investor Day back in September.\nRyan Connors: Now, one of the things that a relevant peer company had an issue with the tech business where it was repeatedly the source of trouble and discussion disproportionate to its size and decided, you know, what we're going to just fold that into the other businesses to keep it from attracting so much attention to itself. Would you \u2013 would there \u2013 and I know M&CS was a relatively new segment. Sensus, I guess, was within water infrastructure for a while, and then it was broken out. Would there be any sense to making a similar move to kind of changing the reporting structure so that M&CS doesn't repeatedly sort of dominate the discussion as it has?\nPatrick Decker: Yeah. Just for a matter of correction. So, actually, Sensus was not part of water infrastructure. So I just want to clarify that. It's always been a stand-alone piece. And no we don't have any plans or any reporting changes or integration. I mean, I want to be clear to all listening. It's \u2013 not everything we're doing from a digital standpoint is happening within M&CS. M&CS is a proxy for the clean water side of the utility market. Water Infrastructure is a proxy for the wastewater side of utility market, and Applied Water is a proxy for those customers in the world that consume water. Digital runs through all three of them. It just right now is more prominent within M&CS. And as a result of that, that's why we're getting hit on the chip side. I mean, 30% to 40% of our M&CS revenue is exposed to chip shortages right now. And two-thirds of our backlog is dependent on chips. But that is a result quite frankly of the demand that we've created in the marketplace because of the innovation that we're driving. So no, there's no plans to rethink or change our reporting structure.\nRyan Connors: Okay. Thanks for your time.\nPatrick Decker: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Lee with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, everyone. This is Miguel on for Brian. Thanks for taking the time.\nPatrick Decker: Hey, Miguel.\nSandy Rowland: Good morning, Miguel.\nUnidentified Analyst: Good morning. Just wanted to touch back on the M&CS cadence that you laid out for 2022, low-double-digits in the first half and then high-double-digits in the second half. And then you also noted that organic growth is going to be flattish for this year, but the backlog is going to be rolling through and that backlog has grown. So when we think about the cadence for the year, how much of that first half second half cadence is that backlog getting converted? And then, how much of that might be any additional price actions that might be also contributing to that cadence? Thanks. And I have a follow-on.\nSandy Rowland: Yes. So just to give you some perspective on how we're thinking about M&CS and how it shifts through the year. We exited Q4 of 2021 with about $300 million of revenue in the segment. And so that would put us on a $1.2 billion run rate for the year. Getting back to flat assumes that throughout the year we kind of add about $20 million of incremental revenue each quarter. And it puts us back at the end of 2022, very much like what we saw in the first half of 2021 from a size perspective. And while we're starting to eat into some of the backlog, we're by no means clearing all of that in 2022. That's going to take 18 to 24 months to get that worked through. And so we would expect very strong growth coming out of this segment in 2023 and 2024.\nPatrick Decker: So we've again built what we believe to be a balanced and responsible guide here. By means is there a huge hockey stick built into this guide. And certainly, what we see in terms of backlog conversion, I mean that is the upside variable for us as we look out over time here. And again, the margins that are built into that.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay, great. That's super helpful. And my last question, I can pass it on is, so last quarter you called out some order push-outs in the fourth quarter into 2022. And then just thinking through the guidance for this year is 3% to 5% organic and then, long-term annual organic growth is 46%. You mentioned you didn't lose orders. But how do we think about I guess, a bridge on those orders coming out of 2021 and into 2022, the guidance 3% to 5% organic in 2022 and that compares to the long-term guidance of 4% to 6%. Just trying to think through those orders. But then, you also mentioned the 18 to 24 months, I guess it will take to flow through all that backlog. So, just looking for a little bit more color there. Thanks.\nPatrick Decker: Sure. Yes. So, we've got -- we came into the year talking about -- I think in the last call we talked about there being about $100 million of orders that had moved to the right based on supply issues. That number right now would probably be about $120 million, that's moved to the right. And so to Sandy's point, we're really not eating tremendously into backlog in this guide. That happens even more in 2023. So, when you look at our orders growth for the full year of 2021 and even Q4, a big chunk of that is deals and the M&CS backlog that don't convert until 2023. And so, that really is the big swing factor here in our guidance is how quickly can we convert that volume based upon supply. So we exit this year, second half more in line with that up mid to high-single-digits year-over-year, and we would expect that to continue in line with what we talked about at Investor Day.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay, great. Thanks. It\u2019s very helpful. I\u2019ll pass it on.\nPatrick Decker: Sure.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Please go ahead.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Good morning, everyone.\nPatrick Decker: Good morning.\nSandy Rowland: Good morning, Andy.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Just focusing on capital deployment for a minute. Your balance sheet is obviously in really good shape here and we know you've been a little more quiet on the M&A side lately. So, do you think 2022 is more of an active year for you which could include M&A or maybe the potential for a bigger repurchase given what the stock is doing?\nPatrick Decker: Yes. Thanks for the question. As you said I mean we are coming into the year with a really strong balance sheet again over $2 billion in liquidity. As always it takes two to tango here. And I think we've shown before that we're not hesitant to get a deal done when there's a really good deal to be done. I do think that the -- there's an attractive market right now. There are assets out there both of scale and even kind of small to medium size that we have been studying and I think this will be an active year. And certainly what's going on in the markets right now by no means deters us from that commitment. They will always tie back to our overall strategy, but it's a rich market and we're looking forward to 2022.\nAndy Kaplowitz: And then Patrick what are infrastructures hung in there in terms of margin performance a fair amount better than the other two segments. We obviously know about the chips impacting M&CS. But is there anything different in terms of that segment's performance that you might be able to apply to other segments to improve their performance as you wait for the chip shortage to run its course and your backlog to burn.\nPatrick Decker: Sure. I would say both Water Infrastructure and Applied Water are they are more mature businesses. They are we're market leaders in that space as we are in M&CS but they're in different end-markets than our M&CS segment is in terms of a conversion to digital and kind of being a large deal kind of dependent. So, they've done a great job. Those teams have done a great job of operational discipline around productivity price realization. They continue to do that. We continue to invest -- and those businesses our vitality indices in both those businesses continue to be quite impressive in terms of how we're driving innovation in that space. So, very pleased with it. I think the water infrastructure business serves the wastewater side of the market for the most part. That does tend to be a more stable environment where the big chunk of that is OpEx versus CapEx from a utility perspective. And on the Applied Water side, they're serving the users of water which again tend to be more stable in terms of end-market demand. And the reason we've outperformed the market there is really the aggressive stance we've taken on new products and entering some new markets on the emerging market side. So, there's nothing I would say we translate from those two over to M&CS. Each one of them is in a different part of the cycle and serving different part of the market. \nAndy Kaplowitz: Appreciate it Patrick.\nPatrick Decker: Thank you.\nOperator: We will take our next question from John Walsh with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nJohn Walsh: Hi, good morning.\nPatrick Decker: Good morning.\nSandy Rowland: Good morning John.\nPatrick Decker: Maybe just two quick ones for me. Following up to Deane's question, we've been starting to hear some companies talk about this metric of kind of how much of semi chips or components they've already secured to give them visibility into their outlook. So, you made the comments you've had no de-commits. But I'm just curious on your commitments from your suppliers do you have the majority of what you need committed at least to deliver on your guide, or do you need to get more commitments from your suppliers to deliver on the guide?\nPatrick Decker: Yes. No great question John. So, our guide really reflects a modest recovery in the chip supply. So, to put some numbers at least directionally around that obviously it depends upon the product line and specifically the component. But overall coming into the year, we only were getting about half of what our demand was on the critical components in terms -- if you think about what we could ship in terms of backlog versus what we were able to we're talking 50% supply there. Our guide has reflected in that a gradual recovery that really does not start even until the second half of the year and we get roughly back to about 75% of our demand that's there. And then that improves continually into 2023 and beyond. So, we think we've been responsible here in balance in our guide. It does not assume a miraculous recovery. And clearly that is the big swing factor. If that were to improve considerably than so would our outlook. But right now that's what we see. And that's why we're guiding the way we are.\nJohn Walsh: Great. Thank you for that color. And then, maybe just one on expectations of where backlog and orders could go for the year, you obviously talked about a lot of demand. Would you expect that backlog kind of burns through the year as you convert into sales, or could we expect to see backlog kind of continue to grow?\nSandy Rowland: Yeah. You know John, I think we talked a lot about this, that we're not going to be able to eat into a tremendous amount of our backlog, particularly in the M&CS segment because of the supply chain shortages. So when I look at Xylem overall, we would expect backlog to continue to grow in 2022. There are a couple of segments where we have especially large backlogs that are really book and ship business. And if we get customers back into more normal ordering patterns you may see a modest reduction there. But overall, we expect next year that we'll be talking about strong backlogs as well. The pipeline the bidding pipeline and funnel still looks really robust.\nJohn Walsh: Great, I appreciate you taking my questions. I'll pass it along.\nPatrick Decker: Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Andrew Buscaglia with Berenberg. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Buscaglia: Good morning guys. I was hoping you can talk a\u2026\nPatrick Decker: Good morning.\nMatt Latino: Good morning, Andrew.\nAndrew Buscaglia: I was hoping you can talk a little bit about -- you're not seeing, cancellations which is great in your backlog building. If we are to see some of these projects move forward, I guess, where do you feel more optimistic regionally that this is going to occur. And I think I say that because I think earlier this week the Finance Minister of India is calling out $530 billion in public infrastructure spending in one year I think. So I'm just wondering if we're going to see upside if these delays move forward, where will it be coming from do you think?\nPatrick Decker: Sure. So, certainly, I would say, the two areas that we would see more meaningful progression. And we feel very good about our emerging markets business. We continue to expect that to be growing in the high-single digits. It's been a great performing part of our portfolio for a number of years now. And if anything that business has become more balanced, I would say before we were very largely dependent on China. China is still a great business for us. And we expect great results there. But it's good to see the rest of our portfolio there move forward. It's also more mature in terms of OpEx spend versus CapEx. So that's one area where we think -- we feel good about it and there could be opportunities to accelerate that. It really -- the biggest swing factor would be within M&CS. And it's mostly water utilities in North America. And I would say there, it really is the large utilities where we've won these large AMI deals where it is less likely that they would ever switch out to someone else. And as I said earlier, we're already doing the comms work to secure that volume going forward. And so if there were any kind of releasing of orders in terms of being able to convert them it would be in that space. Those are the two big swing factors for us.\nAndrew Buscaglia: Okay, interesting. And maybe one last one on -- with your capital allocation and M&A, you had some commentary there. I'm wondering, now that the supply chain challenges seem to be more prolonged. Is that kind of -- maybe you hesitate in terms of moving forward with anything until you get a better handle on rightsizing the ship here? Or is it the other case where do you think the -- do you think some of your targets might feel we're comfortable being part of a bigger entity like yours where the supply chain challenges may work in your favor I wonder.\nPatrick Decker: Yeah. So it's a great question we're experiencing right now in terms of the chip supply issue does not change our view on M&A. Our resolve there is strong. We see attractive opportunities working through these supply chain challenges. We have the team in place that's all over this. And they would not be distracted by anything we might do on the M&A side. At the same time, I think you're pointing to the fact that, certainly in these types of situations companies at size and scale certainly have an advantage and we certainly look to leverage that strength. When the time is right and the opportunity is right and again it takes two to tango.\nAndrew Buscaglia: Right. Thanks very much.\nPatrick Decker: Thank you.\nOperator: Next question comes from Joe Giordano with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead. \nJoe Giordano: Hi, guys. Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in. \nPatrick Decker: Hi, Joe. Good morning.\nJoe Giordano: Hey. So Patrick you've referenced a couple of times on M&CS like first half of 2021 is like a barometer of where we might exit. If I look back though like even first half 2021 it's still pretty far away from a margin standpoint from like what we saw in 2017-2018 on EBITDA. Like what kind of conditions need to be in place to really get that business to like a 20% level? Is that like a realistic couple of years outlook? \nPatrick Decker: Yes. No, it's a great question Joe. So if you think back over time after we acquired the Sensus business and we built the M&CS segment the portfolio, we also made a fairly significant investment in digital whether it be in the metrology business and some new product introductions designing for large deals that we were looking to win. And also we were \u2013 pardon me, making investments in some of the new digital acquisitions that we made. So again that's paying off now when you look at the growth in orders and backlog the margin visibility we have in that. So that is a period of time that we were going through. And when we've looked at this segment when we get to a run rate of roughly $400 million in revenue which we have visibility to in our backlog you're looking at EBITDA margins that are 20% plus. So I realize that people have been patient, people have been wondering kind of what that curve is. And again it really is about demand that we see in backlog and the margin profile that we see. But that time line that you're talking about Joe was a period of investment. \nJoe Giordano: Yes. Not fair. I also noticed that the inflation at AWS was like significantly higher than the other two segments. That was just like a weird kind of way it flowed in on a quarterly cadence but anything that we need to note there? \nSandy Rowland: No that's a great observation, Joe. I think that's a trend we've been seeing all year that the inflation has impacted our AWS business the most. We did see that tick up in Q4. I would say that's part of the business that we're also seeing the greatest price realization. And we're a little bit out of balance in Q1. And as we move into Q2 and the back half of the year, we're going to be in a much stronger position there in light of the actions that we're taking to drive more price realization. \nPatrick Decker: And I would say Joe the other piece of this is Applied Water is the business that is also more U.S.-centric in terms of impact there. We clearly have seen higher inflation from a geographic standpoint in the US. We've seen that also in M&CS, but the reason you don't hear us talking as much about it is because again we have these price clauses in our large deals in the backlog. So it's a different kind of cycle that we're facing in those two businesses. \nJoe Giordano: Thanks, guys.\nPatrick Decker: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll go next to Graham Price with Raymond James. Please go ahead. \nGraham Price: Hi. Good morning and thank you for taking my question. \nPatrick Decker: Sure.\nGraham Price: I guess on the infrastructure spending side you talked about the US and emerging markets and you specifically called out strong funding activity in Europe. So I was wondering what you're seeing there both with respect to spending and then time frames as well. Is that a 2022 story or more of a 2023?\nPatrick Decker: Yes. I think, in the aggregate, discussions around infrastructure spending by geography. I would say certainly in US and Europe that is more of a '23 story. We don't have that really reflected in our guide. I think that when you look at it in the various countries that we label as emerging markets, China is in its first year of its latest five-year plan. So, there will be softness there in the early part of this year based upon our historical experience. And then it will quickly begin to ramp. So we still feel very good about China. India, other parts of Eastern Europe as an example, we see those being opportunities and benefits that we will see in '22, because those programs are already active. But I think for US and Europe which is the largest chunk of this, it really is more of a '23 story. Otherwise Europe is in a very healthy state right now from a demand standpoint. And we don't really see any shocks or big inflection points there. It's pretty predictable for us right now as it relates to Europe.\nGraham Price: Got it. Thank you. That's certainly helpful. And then just curious, I guess for 4Q, did you see any site access issues due to Omicron and COVID? And then, is that an issue that you're tracking going forward?\nPatrick Decker: We did. It definitely is one we're tracking going forward. We didn't have any meaningful site access impacts from Omicron. But we certainly have supply chain challenges in terms of logistics and port delays and we navigated through that. We didn't really highlight it a lot in our coverage on Q4 because the teams really just did a great job of working through that. So we did get impacted by that on the supply chain. We have some of that carryover in Q1 and we have that reflected in our guide for Q1. But certainly, as we look forward, we don't see that as being a lingering issue for the balance of the year at least based upon this current strain.\nGraham Price: Got it. Understood. Thank you, very much.\nPatrick Decker: Thank you.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the floor back over to Patrick Decker for any additional or closing remarks.\nPatrick Decker: Great. Thank you. So, thanks everybody for your time and attention this morning. And again, I appreciate the support and the great questions. We'll be back in touch with you on our next earnings call, if not between now and then. So, have a good day and stay safe.\nOperator: Thank you. And this does conclude today's Xylem Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2021 Conference Call. Please disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Sandy Rowland",
            "content": "Thanks Patrick. Please turn to slide 4, and I'll cover our fourth quarter results. As Patrick indicated, significant chip shortages impacting the utilities end-market in the U.S. more than, offset utilities growth in Europe and strong growth in the Industrial segment globally. Given the quarter's challenges, the team did an outstanding job delivering on our commitments and increasingly tough circumstances with particularly strong performance on price and discipline on costs. In a moment I'll give you a detailed performance by segment. But in short, utilities was down 9% a result of supply chain constraints acutely impacting our smart metering business in the U.S. Industrial grew 7%, on sustained strength in China and healthy activity in the U.S. Commercial was up modestly at 1% and residential was down 4% on challenging comparisons in the prior year when we grew mid-teens. Organic orders were up 23% in the quarter as demand for our technologies continues to be healthy across all segments. EBITDA margin was 16.2% which was within our guided range. Year-over-year EBITDA margin contracted 260 basis points as productivity savings and strong price realization benefits were more than offset by inflation mix and strategic investments. We continue to invest for example in geographic market coverage to serve increasing demand and enhanced digital capabilities across the portfolio. Our EPS in the quarter was $0.63. And please turn to slide 5, and I'll review the quarter's segment performance in a bit more detail. Water Infrastructure orders in the fourth quarter were up 30% organically versus last year. That includes a project cancellation last year in India, which we discussed on a previous call. Otherwise, orders were up mid-single digits. This order's pace reflects resilient demand in our Wastewater Utility business in the U.S. and Europe as well as increasing demand for dewatering particularly in emerging markets. Water Infrastructure revenue was up modestly in the quarter. Healthy growth in Industrial was partly offset by a small decline in our Wastewater Utility business in the U.S. where order to revenue conversion was challenged by long ocean transit times. Geographically, results were mixed for the segment. The U.S. and Western Europe were up low-single digits and mid-single digits respectively. Healthy treatment deliveries in both geographies were offset by the delays I just mentioned. Emerging markets was down low single digits, largely due to an especially strong performance in China last year. EBITDA margin for the segment was down 50 basis points as significant savings from productivity and cost reductions were offset by inflation and strategic investments. Please turn to page 6. In the Applied Water segment orders were up 10% organically in the quarter, driven by healthy demand in all geographies. Revenues increased 3% with high single-digit growth in industrial and a modest increase in commercial, partially offset by sales down mid-single digits in residential. Geographically the US was up high single digits. Growth in all end-markets was led by ongoing industrial recovery. Emerging markets was up mid-single digits on continuing industrial strength in China and momentum in Eastern Europe. Western Europe delivered low single-digits growth with moderate gains balanced across all end-markets. Segment EBITDA margin declined 340 basis points in the quarter. Material and freight inflation more than offset solid productivity gains and accelerating price realization. And now let's turn to slide 7 and I'll cover our Measurement & Control Solutions business. M&CS orders grew 28% organically in the quarter, reflecting strong demand for our metrology solutions as well as healthy demand across all other applications in this segment including test and pipeline assessment services. This puts our M&CS backlog up 63% versus the prior year. As we anticipated, revenue declined 17% due to constrained chip supply. It's worth noting that the growing metrology backlog is both resilient and margin accretive. There have been no cancellations of AMI contracts and we expect large project deployments will resume in the back half of the year as component supply becomes available. Geographically, US revenues were down 21%. Western Europe and emerging markets declined more modestly at 10% and 2%, respectively from pockets of growth in our water quality test business. Segment EBITDA margin in the quarter was down 750 basis points. Volume was the biggest factor as this business gets very strong operating leverage from higher revenues, which were constrained by the lower conversion of orders. Those volume effects along with higher inflation were partially offset by productivity gains and cost discipline. And now let's turn to slide 8 for an overview of cash flows and the company's financial position. Our financial position remains robust as we exit the year with $1.3 billion in cash and available liquidity of more than $2 billion. Net debt-to-EBITDA leverage is 1.2 times. After delivering free cash flow conversion of 181% last year, our free cash flow conversion was 77% in 2021, slightly below our target for the year. While our team made continued progress driving collections, we consciously increased our inventory safety stocks in the second half of the year to mitigate supply chain volatility but we remain committed to at least 100% conversion over the cycle. A further item of note. As we previously advised, we are derisking our balance sheet with the buyout of our largest defined pension plan in the UK. We expect to finalize this transfer in 2022, at which point we'll recognize a non-cash charge of approximately $170 million, primarily consisting of unrecognized actuarial losses, which are reflected in equity today. Lastly, in line with our capital allocation framework. Today we announced an increase in our annual dividend of 7% and that is our 11th consecutive annual increase. Please turn to slide 9 and I'll hand back to Patrick to look forward at 2022. Thanks, Patrick. We expect underlying demand will continue to be healthy through 2022. However, as Patrick just described, business conditions aren't likely to normalize on an entirely predictable path. So we've taken a view of the year that reflects those dynamics, balancing external constraints and potential upsides. We anticipate our utility business overall which is just north of 50% of Xylem revenues will grow low-single-digits in 2022. On the wastewater side, we expect low-single-digit to mid-single-digit growth as we see a continuation of resilient global demand. We anticipate strong demand in emerging markets, driven by considerable investment in public utilities, increasing OpEx activity as well as the benefit of our localization strategy. The outlook for longer-term capital project spending and bid activity is very solid globally. On the clean water side, we anticipate revenues will be flat. Demand remains robust but deliveries will be constrained by chip shortages mentioned earlier. We foresee healthy momentum in our test and assessment services businesses due to increasing focus on infrastructure and climate challenges. And now, please turn to slide 12. Looking at the Industrial end market, we expect to grow mid-single-digits on steady demand for our solutions globally. We continue to see healthy growth in dewatering, especially in emerging markets from increasing mining demand and benefiting from our localization strategies. In the US and Western Europe, we expect solid order rates and backlog expansion as activity ramps in light industrial applications. The Commercial end market should deliver mid-single-digit growth on solid replacement business in the US as well as acceleration of institutional construction. In Europe, we see increased construction activity, driven by the rise in funding for green buildings, driving demand for our new eco-friendly product offerings in that space. In residential, our smallest end-market, we are expecting low single-digit to mid-single-digit growth with healthy demand. And now, let's turn to Slide 13, and I'll walk you through our updated guidance. For Xylem overall, we foresee full year 2022 organic revenue growth in the range of 3% to 5% with flat revenues in the first half and high single-digit growth in the second half. This breaks down by segment as follows: Mid-single-digit growth in Water Infrastructure with solid growth in both Wastewater Utilities and Industrial. Mid-single-digit growth in Applied Water from solid mid-single-digit growth in Industrial and Commercial applications and low to mid-single-digit growth in residential. We expect Measurement & Control Solutions to be flattish. As Patrick mentioned earlier, this assumes down double-digits in this half of the year and up double-digits in the second half. Although growth is still likely to be partially constrained by the gradual return of chip supply as the second half progresses. Despite that partial recoverability and the availability of chips, volumes and margins will remain supply constrained. The constraint will have an unfavorable impact on volume and mix more than offsetting the benefits of price realization and productivity savings through the year. For 2022, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of 16% to 17%. In the first half of the year, we anticipate EBITDA will be approximately 14% to 15%, bouncing back to 18% to 19% in the second half. And this puts EBITDA in the second half in line with the long-term targets we laid out at Investor Day. This yields an adjusted EPS range of $2.35 to $2.70. Free cash flow conversion is expected to be at least 100% of net income. We have provided you with other full year assumptions on this slide to supplement your models. We're assuming a euro to dollar conversion rate of 1.13 and as foreign exchange can be volatile, our FX sensitivity table is included in the appendix. And now drilling down in the first quarter, we anticipate total company organic revenues will be in the range of flat to up 2%. This includes mid-single-digit growth in Water Infrastructure and Applied Water and M&CS is expected to decline low double-digits. We expect first quarter adjusted EBITDA margin to be in the range of 13.5% to 14% impacted by higher inflation and supply chain challenges. We expect this will be the low point in adjusted EBITDA in the year with accelerating sequential quarterly improvement. And with that please turn to Slide 14 and I'll turn the call back over to Patrick for closing comments. Good morning, Dean. Yes. Great question, Deane. The momentum that we have on the orders front is really, really strong and it's broad-based across our portfolio. So when I'll start with more of our book and ship businesses in AWS and water infrastructure, there we know that we've taken price actions throughout 2021. And actually we've taken some incremental price actions already in 2022. And so we know that those orders that we recently secured are going to be more competitive and balanced against the inflation headwinds that we're facing. When we think about the longer-term large AMI contracts, most of those contracts have inflation adjusters, which are tied to CPI. And so that -- while those -- all of those won't be delivered in 2022, it's going to take us some time once we get back to good flow on the chip side to clear out that backlog, but those price resets will help protect the margin. And when we think about those large AMI deals where we're looking at gross margins above 40%. Good morning Nate. Yes. I think really good question Nate. The inflation rate certainly picked up on us in Q4. So when we look at sort of exit -- when we look at overall inflation for 2021, it was in the 8% range. And when we exited Q4, it bumped up to about 12%. So that was a meaningful increase and it actually outpaced what we had incorporated into our guide. On the flip side, we did get some more price in the fourth quarter than we had modeled and so they kind of netted, which is why we came in with EBITDA margins in line with our forecast. Good morning. So good question. I think we have seen increasing momentum in dewatering, as we move throughout the year. And in fourth quarter overall, we saw high single-digit growth. We actually saw growth in all of our markets but especially strong momentum coming in emerging markets because of strong mining demand. Really, it was on both fronts the rental front and the equipment sales front both showed positive signs. We've taken some steps this year to invest a little bit more on the CapEx side to refresh our fleet. And we expect to see some positive benefits from that as we go into 2022. Good morning, Miguel. Yes. So just to give you some perspective on how we're thinking about M&CS and how it shifts through the year. We exited Q4 of 2021 with about $300 million of revenue in the segment. And so that would put us on a $1.2 billion run rate for the year. Getting back to flat assumes that throughout the year we kind of add about $20 million of incremental revenue each quarter. And it puts us back at the end of 2022, very much like what we saw in the first half of 2021 from a size perspective. And while we're starting to eat into some of the backlog, we're by no means clearing all of that in 2022. That's going to take 18 to 24 months to get that worked through. And so we would expect very strong growth coming out of this segment in 2023 and 2024. Good morning, Andy. Good morning John. Yeah. You know John, I think we talked a lot about this, that we're not going to be able to eat into a tremendous amount of our backlog, particularly in the M&CS segment because of the supply chain shortages. So when I look at Xylem overall, we would expect backlog to continue to grow in 2022. There are a couple of segments where we have especially large backlogs that are really book and ship business. And if we get customers back into more normal ordering patterns you may see a modest reduction there. But overall, we expect next year that we'll be talking about strong backlogs as well. The pipeline the bidding pipeline and funnel still looks really robust. No that's a great observation, Joe. I think that's a trend we've been seeing all year that the inflation has impacted our AWS business the most. We did see that tick up in Q4. I would say that's part of the business that we're also seeing the greatest price realization. And we're a little bit out of balance in Q1. And as we move into Q2 and the back half of the year, we're going to be in a much stronger position there in light of the actions that we're taking to drive more price realization."

            "name": "Patrick Decker",
            "content": "Thanks, Matt and good morning, everyone. As we indicated in our release this morning, the team delivered a strong operational performance in the fourth quarter meeting or exceeding our expectations across all major metrics. Despite the challenges that 2021 presented us especially in the second half, I'm very proud of the team for what they did to deliver on our commitments. And as a team they delivered a very strong full year performance. This was reflected by mid single-digit organic revenue growth, solid EBITDA margin expansion of 80 basis points and adjusted earnings per share growth of 21%. And orders grew 23% for the year and in the fourth quarter giving us very strong momentum coming into 2022. We posted our strongest orders growth in our M&CS segment. And it reflects the need and desire of our customers for digital solutions to address their growing needs around water affordability and infrastructure resilience. Our Water Infrastructure and Applied Water segments also posted very strong orders growth for the year and the fourth quarter demonstrating the healthy demand across our portfolio. We continue to experience very strong underlying demand globally with double-digit orders growth across all regions and we expect that momentum to continue throughout 2022 and beyond. And our investments in R&D are clearly paying off enabling us to win market share due to the customer value we're creating. And our investments in geographic coverage have made significant contributions to our overall growth especially in emerging markets where we posted double-digit revenue growth in 2021. Of course, the other side of the story in 2021 was the constrained supply chain challenges of the second half along with inflation that really accelerated in the last quarter. As we anticipated in our last conference call, the severe chip shortage affecting the entire tech sector held back our ability to convert such strong orders into revenue, especially in our M&CS segment. Against that backdrop, the team did an excellent job managing what we can control, bringing discretionary costs down below 2020 levels and taking aggressive pricing actions to mitigate inflationary pressures. In fact, price realization in the fourth quarter was modestly higher than our expectations, and we expect to offset inflation further as we deliver accretive margins in our backlogs. So despite all of the year's headwinds the team not only delivered solid operational results but they did it with heart and purpose. Along the way we made significant progress towards our 2025 signature sustainability goals. One example of that is that the team set a Xylem record for hours volunteered to solve water challenges in our communities around the world. It's a privilege, to be a part of a team with that level of commitment to our mission. Now looking ahead to 2022, we see continued strong demand for our products and solutions, strong fundamentals across our business in terms of productivity and free cash flow conversion, and continued ability to drive price as a market leader to offset inflationary pressures. Nevertheless, our outlook is tempered by the reality of a prolonged chip shortage, limiting the speed at which we can convert orders to revenue. So we are being balanced in our guidance, based upon the visibility we have. Our guidance assumes modest and gradual increases in chip supply in the second half and into 2023. And as volumes return, we expect to realize significant margin expansion consistent with the first half of this past year when we operate in a less chip constrained environment in M&CS. And we see this in the backlog margins we have coming into 2022. In the second half of this year growth in margin expansion both gross margin and EBITDA are expected to return to levels that put us on track to deliver on the 2025 strategic and financial framework that we outlined last September at our Investor Day. In a moment, we'll discuss the assumptions in our 2022 outlook, and speak to our intentions for capital deployment given the strength of our financial and competitive position. But first, I'm going to hand it over to Sandy to dig in briefly on the quarter's results before we turn back to 2022. Thanks Sandy. We see strong demand continuing through 2022 and strong fundamentals in all our businesses. On the other hand, the reality is that supply constraints will continue to be an important and not entirely predictable variable. So we are reflecting a responsible set of assumptions in our guidance, while working aggressively to improve the situation. We anticipate chip availability will improve for the year, but not linearly and not all at once. In the first half, shortages are still likely to hold back conversion of orders to revenue with disproportionate impact on our higher-margin solutions. So we'll be focused on operating with discipline, driving price productivity and cost during what we foresee being a transitory period. In the second half of the year, supply should begin to improve modestly and the pace of chip shipments will have a determining effect on our growth rate and margin expansion. As components begin to come through, the margin upside is highly accretive to our margin profile. The positive side of this dynamic was apparent in the first half of 2021 when chip supply did not limit M&CS growth and we saw margin expansion of more than 500 basis points in the portfolio. Given the size and growth of our metrology backlogs, it's worth expanding on a point Sandy made a moment ago about the resilience of those backlogs. Large AMI projects are not easily substituted and they offer a compelling business case for our customers, particularly as they are addressing issues of affordability and regulatory commitments. Our utility customers often spend years in pilot testing, approval and procurement to determine these solutions. So despite these near-term delays, we do not anticipate backlog erosion. Turning to slide 10. You can see our focus areas for 2022, which will keep us aligned to our long-term financial framework. The team is managing through the current challenges with great discipline, working with both suppliers and customers. Even though we expect chip supply will gradually improve in the second half we don't anticipate suppliers will be able to serve 100% of our requirements given the sheer size of our order books. So we're working with our most critical supply partner to accelerate redesign options and we're staying close to our customers to prioritize serving their most mission-critical needs. Since visibility about the likely rate of improvement is imperfect, we're also phasing our ongoing strategic investments with an eye on leading indicators of supply recovery. Now, before I turn to Sandy for more detail on our outlook, I want to comment briefly on capital deployment. We're coming into the year with a strong balance sheet and more than $2 billion in liquidity. So, M&A naturally comes to mind as a strategic accelerator for sustained growth and margin expansion. And those of you who've been with us a while, you know that we're not hesitant to do a deal when there's a good deal to be done in service of advancing the company's overall strategy. And our view is that there are opportunities for strategic value creation in the marketplace for a company like us with our financial strength and sector leadership. But we will continue to be disciplined and selective with an eye towards significant value creation. Now, I'll turn it back over to Sandy for more on our outlook. Thanks, Sandy. We're coming into 2022 in a strong and enviable position. The market demand for our solutions and technologies has never been greater. We have strong commercial momentum with very strong orders growth and high-margin backlogs that prove our conviction about the investments we've been making and our customers need and appetite and the foundation and flexibility of a powerful balance sheet giving us strategic options in a dynamic marketplace. In the short term of course, no one likes being constrained by externalities. But we have strong resolve and operating discipline and fully expect to deliver a year of results on track with our 2025 strategic and financial goals and that are aligned to our overall investment thesis, that of being a technology leader with a durable business model, bringing differentiated offerings to a market of rising demand for sustainable water solutions, committed to driving above-market growth and margin expansion as our portfolio continues to digitize and to accelerating value creation with disciplined active capital allocation. So now operator, I'll turn the call over to you for questions. Hey. Good morning, Dean. How are you doing? Sure. Certainly, Deane. Great question. So you've nailed it. If we look at our supply chain challenges right now, 80% of the issue roughly is microcontrollers. And I'll come back in a moment to what we're doing there to try to mitigate that as best we can. And we can also talk about what we're doing to make sure that we hold on to the backlog that we've got right now which has really attractive margins in it. But the 20% that is more on the microprocessing side, we face those challenges in Q4 and the team did a terrific job on substitution, really going out into the open market and broad distribution and really helped us mitigate that. Otherwise we would have really had a bigger hit in Q4 than what we mitigated, now really is about the microcontroller. So, what we're doing there, we are partnering with our suppliers on redesign. And there what we're doing is we're redesigning along with where they see future designs going across the broader technology sector. But those really -- those impacts really aren't going to hit us until -- or benefit us until probably Q4 going into '23 because it is a lead time. We are doing alternate sourcing and that's certainly helping us buffer some of the demand here. And we're also resurrecting some of our legacy meters as a bridge in some of these larger AMI implementations to go ahead and get these projects started. Lastly, I would say on the large AMI deals, what we work with our customers on is they've really been encouraged by us going out and beginning to build out the comm side the communication side. So we get the products going. And we've also opened up them to have the opportunity to go out and use alternate meters. And honestly, Deane, they've come back to us because, they realize, they believe in the value proposition, they see what we're doing here and they want to be with us. So, we're working it every day. We feel good about where we are in terms of protecting backlog and the team is all over this in terms of what we can do to mitigate the chip supply situation. Deane, on that point also, Deane, just to give you a feel for kind of how things are going with our suppliers right now. We had a number of de-commits from our large suppliers in Q4. Those de-commits have ceased. We haven't had a de-commit for quite some time now. They've actually been delivering on forecast. And the lead times, while they are still very lengthy, I mean we had lead times up to 78 weeks on some of our key components here. Those have moved down modestly, but the good news is they're moving in the right direction. Yes, incremental margins. Thank you, Deane. Hey, Nate. How are you doing? And so Nate what I would offer up here is as we -- it really is a story of momentum. So to Sandy's point we were very aggressive on price in Q4 and continue to be. And our price/cost is going to be positive as we go into Q2. We weren't able to go in and reprice all of our backlog. We repriced some of it, but we're going to be price cost positive in Q2. That really ramps in the back half of 2022. And for the full year we are going to be price/cost positive for the full year. The teams have done a great job on the pricing front. Sure. So Nate, yes, so perhaps what I can do is just spend a moment on explaining kind of the metering market. So you've got two different types of meters. You've got static, which is really kind of where the market is going that's where the market overall is going. Our competitors are also moving that direction and then you have the mechanical kind of traditional meters, which we certainly have those, but it's a much smaller portion of our portfolio. The benefits of static versus mechanical from our view and certainly customers view is static meters are more accurate over the life of the meter. You have less moving parts in a static meter, you're able to build in other kind of bells and whistles like advanced alarms around link detection. And obviously, with the data that it's able to gather helps around non-revenue water. So there's a lot of kind of economic and environmental value and that's why the industry is moving towards static. We are further along in that move. And so as a result of that, we are more exposed to chips because the microcontroller really is the brain, of that static meter. And so to your question around, kind of the day-to-day replacement business, to be honest we have seen some customers that have gone back to traditional to say \"Hey it's good enough right now.\" But that's only transitory. And even we are resurrecting, our old mechanical meters to help bridge that time that we're there. Most importantly, on these larger signature wins, again these large AMI deals, which are really the indicator of where the market is going. We've not lost those. And if anything we've seen -- we're still winning deals in that environment because the value proposition is so strong and so robust. And again, what we're focusing on right now is, making sure we get the communications platform in place to really secure those and move those forward. Thank you, Nathan. Good morning, Bryan Yes. Bryan one of the things -- on that last point, one of the things that we had done when we were in the down cycle in that business, we were curtailing some of our CapEx to protect margins and just see kind of stabilize that business. Now we really see there being opportunity that is, we invest even just a little bit more in the fleet and from a CapEx perspective That traditionally has yielded very positive returns, both from a growth and a margins perspective. And we don't have all that built into our guide but we do see a strong recovery there. Yes, certainly. You're right we don't have any of that built into our guide for 2022. It really is -- and we didn't really even have anything built in meaningfully into our outline of kind of long-range, objectives in our Investor Day because we always talked about that being a possible support mechanism. So it is at 2023 and beyond. But yes, just some specifics on this. I know others have commented both positive and maybe not so positive on when it's going to happen.  Our view is we're talking about $66 billion of investment in a critical Water Infrastructure. 80% of that is going to be administered by the EPA, who we have very strong relationships with at the highest levels. Nearly half of the 193 programs that are funded in this bill, contain commercial opportunities for Xylem. It is more than a one or two-year thing. It really spans over several years. So, there clearly are commercial opportunities there. But again, they're not in our outlook but we are net positive on the trends that we're seeing right now, and the conversations we're having with customers. Yeah. No. I think \u2013 I think the areas that it would be most impactful for us would really be in predominantly three specific areas. It would be certainly dewatering on the construction side, you would see it in our water infrastructure business on the treatment side most notably. We'd also see it on the clean water side, as we're talking about the \u2013 addressing non-revenue water through some of our solutions there. And then there would be an ancillary benefit even on our commercial building and industrial side in Applied Water, where you've got a knock-on effect of some of this infrastructure demand. But it's really going to be predominantly in dewatering treatment and the clean water side? Thank you. Sure. Sure, Ryan. Fair question. I look at the proof points of this business and that is I look at the backlog, so I look at the investments we made I look at the deals that, we've won, I look at the margin profile of those deals in the backlog. I look at the margin profile of even our repair replacement business, and it is very attractive. I look back at the first half of 2021, where we demonstrated even mid-single-digit growth. And we showed 500 basis points of margin expansion from an EBITDA standpoint during that time frame. Have we been \u2013 have we had our licks and our knocks over the last few years, absolutely, whether it be a battery supplier having a fire, whether it be trade conflicts. Now, we have the impacts of chip shortages. Yes, that is the nature unfortunately of us being in a technology leaning business, but the proof points are there. The investments that we've made are paying off in terms of demand, margin profile, and we love this business. And we \u2013 again, we're guiding responsibly this year. We want to give you a balanced view. And even within that balance view look at the margin profile of what we're committing to in the second half of the year, and that is right in track and right on line with what we laid out in Investor Day back in September. Yeah. Just for a matter of correction. So, actually, Sensus was not part of water infrastructure. So I just want to clarify that. It's always been a stand-alone piece. And no we don't have any plans or any reporting changes or integration. I mean, I want to be clear to all listening. It's \u2013 not everything we're doing from a digital standpoint is happening within M&CS. M&CS is a proxy for the clean water side of the utility market. Water Infrastructure is a proxy for the wastewater side of utility market, and Applied Water is a proxy for those customers in the world that consume water. Digital runs through all three of them. It just right now is more prominent within M&CS. And as a result of that, that's why we're getting hit on the chip side. I mean, 30% to 40% of our M&CS revenue is exposed to chip shortages right now. And two-thirds of our backlog is dependent on chips. But that is a result quite frankly of the demand that we've created in the marketplace because of the innovation that we're driving. So no, there's no plans to rethink or change our reporting structure. Thank you. Hey, Miguel. So we've again built what we believe to be a balanced and responsible guide here. By means is there a huge hockey stick built into this guide. And certainly, what we see in terms of backlog conversion, I mean that is the upside variable for us as we look out over time here. And again, the margins that are built into that. Sure. Yes. So, we've got -- we came into the year talking about -- I think in the last call we talked about there being about $100 million of orders that had moved to the right based on supply issues. That number right now would probably be about $120 million, that's moved to the right. And so to Sandy's point, we're really not eating tremendously into backlog in this guide. That happens even more in 2023. So, when you look at our orders growth for the full year of 2021 and even Q4, a big chunk of that is deals and the M&CS backlog that don't convert until 2023. And so, that really is the big swing factor here in our guidance is how quickly can we convert that volume based upon supply. So we exit this year, second half more in line with that up mid to high-single-digits year-over-year, and we would expect that to continue in line with what we talked about at Investor Day. Sure. Good morning. Yes. Thanks for the question. As you said I mean we are coming into the year with a really strong balance sheet again over $2 billion in liquidity. As always it takes two to tango here. And I think we've shown before that we're not hesitant to get a deal done when there's a really good deal to be done. I do think that the -- there's an attractive market right now. There are assets out there both of scale and even kind of small to medium size that we have been studying and I think this will be an active year. And certainly what's going on in the markets right now by no means deters us from that commitment. They will always tie back to our overall strategy, but it's a rich market and we're looking forward to 2022. Sure. I would say both Water Infrastructure and Applied Water are they are more mature businesses. They are we're market leaders in that space as we are in M&CS but they're in different end-markets than our M&CS segment is in terms of a conversion to digital and kind of being a large deal kind of dependent. So, they've done a great job. Those teams have done a great job of operational discipline around productivity price realization. They continue to do that. We continue to invest -- and those businesses our vitality indices in both those businesses continue to be quite impressive in terms of how we're driving innovation in that space. So, very pleased with it. I think the water infrastructure business serves the wastewater side of the market for the most part. That does tend to be a more stable environment where the big chunk of that is OpEx versus CapEx from a utility perspective. And on the Applied Water side, they're serving the users of water which again tend to be more stable in terms of end-market demand. And the reason we've outperformed the market there is really the aggressive stance we've taken on new products and entering some new markets on the emerging market side. So, there's nothing I would say we translate from those two over to M&CS. Each one of them is in a different part of the cycle and serving different part of the market. Thank you. Good morning. Maybe just two quick ones for me. Following up to Deane's question, we've been starting to hear some companies talk about this metric of kind of how much of semi chips or components they've already secured to give them visibility into their outlook. So, you made the comments you've had no de-commits. But I'm just curious on your commitments from your suppliers do you have the majority of what you need committed at least to deliver on your guide, or do you need to get more commitments from your suppliers to deliver on the guide? Yes. No great question John. So, our guide really reflects a modest recovery in the chip supply. So, to put some numbers at least directionally around that obviously it depends upon the product line and specifically the component. But overall coming into the year, we only were getting about half of what our demand was on the critical components in terms -- if you think about what we could ship in terms of backlog versus what we were able to we're talking 50% supply there. Our guide has reflected in that a gradual recovery that really does not start even until the second half of the year and we get roughly back to about 75% of our demand that's there. And then that improves continually into 2023 and beyond. So, we think we've been responsible here in balance in our guide. It does not assume a miraculous recovery. And clearly that is the big swing factor. If that were to improve considerably than so would our outlook. But right now that's what we see. And that's why we're guiding the way we are. Thank you. Good morning. Sure. So, certainly, I would say, the two areas that we would see more meaningful progression. And we feel very good about our emerging markets business. We continue to expect that to be growing in the high-single digits. It's been a great performing part of our portfolio for a number of years now. And if anything that business has become more balanced, I would say before we were very largely dependent on China. China is still a great business for us. And we expect great results there. But it's good to see the rest of our portfolio there move forward. It's also more mature in terms of OpEx spend versus CapEx. So that's one area where we think -- we feel good about it and there could be opportunities to accelerate that. It really -- the biggest swing factor would be within M&CS. And it's mostly water utilities in North America. And I would say there, it really is the large utilities where we've won these large AMI deals where it is less likely that they would ever switch out to someone else. And as I said earlier, we're already doing the comms work to secure that volume going forward. And so if there were any kind of releasing of orders in terms of being able to convert them it would be in that space. Those are the two big swing factors for us. Yeah. So it's a great question we're experiencing right now in terms of the chip supply issue does not change our view on M&A. Our resolve there is strong. We see attractive opportunities working through these supply chain challenges. We have the team in place that's all over this. And they would not be distracted by anything we might do on the M&A side. At the same time, I think you're pointing to the fact that, certainly in these types of situations companies at size and scale certainly have an advantage and we certainly look to leverage that strength. When the time is right and the opportunity is right and again it takes two to tango. Thank you. Hi, Joe. Good morning. Yes. No, it's a great question Joe. So if you think back over time after we acquired the Sensus business and we built the M&CS segment the portfolio, we also made a fairly significant investment in digital whether it be in the metrology business and some new product introductions designing for large deals that we were looking to win. And also we were \u2013 pardon me, making investments in some of the new digital acquisitions that we made. So again that's paying off now when you look at the growth in orders and backlog the margin visibility we have in that. So that is a period of time that we were going through. And when we've looked at this segment when we get to a run rate of roughly $400 million in revenue which we have visibility to in our backlog you're looking at EBITDA margins that are 20% plus. So I realize that people have been patient, people have been wondering kind of what that curve is. And again it really is about demand that we see in backlog and the margin profile that we see. But that time line that you're talking about Joe was a period of investment. And I would say Joe the other piece of this is Applied Water is the business that is also more U.S.-centric in terms of impact there. We clearly have seen higher inflation from a geographic standpoint in the US. We've seen that also in M&CS, but the reason you don't hear us talking as much about it is because again we have these price clauses in our large deals in the backlog. So it's a different kind of cycle that we're facing in those two businesses. Thank you. Sure. Yes. I think, in the aggregate, discussions around infrastructure spending by geography. I would say certainly in US and Europe that is more of a '23 story. We don't have that really reflected in our guide. I think that when you look at it in the various countries that we label as emerging markets, China is in its first year of its latest five-year plan. So, there will be softness there in the early part of this year based upon our historical experience. And then it will quickly begin to ramp. So we still feel very good about China. India, other parts of Eastern Europe as an example, we see those being opportunities and benefits that we will see in '22, because those programs are already active. But I think for US and Europe which is the largest chunk of this, it really is more of a '23 story. Otherwise Europe is in a very healthy state right now from a demand standpoint. And we don't really see any shocks or big inflection points there. It's pretty predictable for us right now as it relates to Europe. We did. It definitely is one we're tracking going forward. We didn't have any meaningful site access impacts from Omicron. But we certainly have supply chain challenges in terms of logistics and port delays and we navigated through that. We didn't really highlight it a lot in our coverage on Q4 because the teams really just did a great job of working through that. So we did get impacted by that on the supply chain. We have some of that carryover in Q1 and we have that reflected in our guide for Q1. But certainly, as we look forward, we don't see that as being a lingering issue for the balance of the year at least based upon this current strain. Thank you. Great. Thank you. So, thanks everybody for your time and attention this morning. And again, I appreciate the support and the great questions. We'll be back in touch with you on our next earnings call, if not between now and then. So, have a good day and stay safe."

Now please turn to Slide 3, and I'll turn the call over to our CEO, Patrick Decker.\nPatrick Decker: Thanks, Matt. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. By now, you will have seen that the team delivered a solid third quarter performance with earnings and margins above our expectations. The fast pace of orders growth that we saw in the first half of the year has continued, with orders up 20% in the quarter, driving our backlog up 34%. That commercial momentum reflects strong underlying demand for our solutions, which continues to be robust in all segments, markets and geographies. Nevertheless, supply-driven constraints on volume slowed the conversion of orders to revenue. A month ago, we indicated a probable $100 million impact on full year revenue, driven by the global supply chain environment. The continuing shortage of electronic components, especially microcontrollers and other chips, is particularly affecting players with large digital solution businesses like Xylem, so we're reflecting those ongoing challenges in our full year view. Having raised guidance at the end of the first and second quarters, we now anticipate that the constraints on volume will moderate our full year revenue growth to between 3% and 4% and bring adjusted earnings per share into a range of $2.40 to $2.50, which represents roughly 20% EPS growth over last year. The growth in orders and EPS reflects the privileged position we're in. Macro trends in our sector are driving durable and increasing demand for sustainable digital water solutions. And the team is executing on a clear strategy to drive above market growth and expand margins as our portfolio continues to digitize. This quarter has been a vivid demonstration of those trends. The team has also shown its ability to capture that demand while showing real discipline on cost. Still, given the impact that supply headwinds are having on volume, we'll provide some additional color on what we're seeing and how the team is addressing those conditions. I've invited Tony Milando, our Chief Supply Chain Officer, to join us on the call today. But first, let me hand over to Sandy to look at the third quarter in more detail, and then we'll turn to a discussion of the market landscape that we see through the end of the year. Sandy, over to you.\nSandy Rowland: Thank you, Patrick. Please turn to Slide 4, and I'll cover our Q3 results in more detail. Revenue grew 2% organically compared to the prior year. Utilities, our largest end market, was down 5% despite continuing strong demand. The decline was driven by supply chain impacts on order conversion, especially chip shortages, slowing M&CS deliveries. Industrial was up 11%, led by continued growth in Emerging Markets and Western Europe. Commercial grew 10%, led by the ongoing recovery in the United States, while residential, our smallest end market, was up 4%. Geographically, Emerging Markets was up high single digits, with particular strength in Eastern Europe and Latin America. Western Europe was up mid-single digits while the US declined modestly. As Patrick mentioned, the team delivered exceptional organic orders growth of 20%, which was broad based across all segments and regions. In fact, year-to-date order volume is higher at this point of the year than in any previous year in company history. M&CS led the way with nearly 40% -- 42% orders growth, driven by large smart metering contract wins, the impact of longer lead times and pent-up demand from a COVID-19 impacted prior year. We're exiting the quarter with an overall backlog of 34%. And as expected, we are seeing positive momentum on price realization, which will continue ramping through Q4 and into 2022. Looking at other key financial metrics. Margins were above our forecasted range with EBITDA margins coming in at 17.9%, reflecting strong productivity and good cost control by the team. Year-over-year, EBITDA margin contracted 30 basis points as inflation and strategic investments were largely offset by productivity, price realization and cost containment. Earnings per share in the quarter was $0.63. Please turn to Slide 5, and I'll review our segment performance for the quarter. In Water Infrastructure, orders were up 9% on strength in wastewater transport applications in the US and Western Europe. Revenues were up 2% organically. Wastewater Utilities were down modestly, mostly due to delays in ocean shipping. Industrial demand was broad based across all regions. Regionally, Emerging Markets delivered high single digit growth, led by increasing industrial dewatering activity. Western Europe was also up, driven by resilient wastewater OpEx spending and recovery in industrial applications. The US was down modestly due to the shipping delays I just mentioned. EBITDA margin expanded over the prior year as strong productivity savings, price realization and volume leverage more than offset inflation and investments. Please turn to Slide 6. In Applied Water, orders were up 17% organically in the quarter on broad industrial strength and commercial recovery. Revenue grew 8% in the quarter from continued commercial momentum and industrial growth in most regions. Residential growth moderated slightly due to volume constraints. Geographically, the US and Western Europe both contributed 6% growth due to the uplift from commercial and industrial. Emerging Markets were up 13% on continued strength in China and gains in Eastern Europe. Segment EBITDA margin contracted 60 basis points compared to the prior year as inflation and investments more than offset productivity benefits and price realization. And now please turn to Slide 7 and I'll cover our Measurement & Control Solutions segment. In M&CS, orders were up 42% organically as I mentioned a moment ago. Our M&CS backlog now stands at roughly $1.6 billion. The bidding pipeline remains very active as customer demand for advanced digital technologies accelerates. Organic revenue was down 5%, which is a tangible effect of chip shortages. Water applications were down modestly as growth in our test and assessment services businesses largely offset lower sales from smart metering. Due to the digital composition of our metrology portfolio, it has a greater exposure to chip shortages. By geography, Western Europe was up 1% while Emerging Markets was flat. The US was down mid single digits. Segment EBITDA margin in the quarter was down 60 basis points compared to the prior year as volume declines from component shortages and higher inflation offset productivity and price realization. And now let's turn to Slide 8 for an overview of cash flows and the company's financial position. Our financial position continues to be very strong. We closed the quarter with $1.3 billion in cash after paying down $600 million of debt in the third quarter. Free cash flow conversion was 57% in the quarter in line with our expectations, and we continue to expect full year free cash flow conversion of 80% to 90%. Net debt-to-EBITDA leverage was 1.3 times at the end of the quarter. And now please turn to Slide 9 and I'll turn the call back over to Patrick.\nPatrick Decker: Thanks, Sandy. The team has clearly done a great job delivering a solid quarter's earnings in difficult circumstances. I want to give a special shout-out to our sales, service and supply chain teams. They've been pulling out all the stops to care for our customers despite the unusual challenges. Let's turn to the quarter now and look forward. Since the supply chain environment has everybody's attention, we want to provide more detail on what we're seeing and the actions we've been taking. So I've asked Tony Milando, our Chief Supply Chain Officer, to walk us through that. Tony, over to you.\nTony Milando: Thank you, Patrick. I'm sure many of you are already familiar with the various dimensions of stress on the supply chain across all sectors. Material shortages are having at least some effect on each of our segments with particular challenges in microcontrollers and other chips. In addition, logistics times have continued to lengthen and carry reliability is at an all-time low. We're also seeing labor tightness in markets where we have significant manufacturing, particularly in the US. Of course, all of this has contributed to inflation across commodities, logistics and labor. We're managing the challenges with both short term mitigations and longer term actions. In short term, we're committing freight with carriers nearly two months further ahead than usual. We're using fast boat options to gain access to smaller ports and thus improve lead times. And we've accelerated value engineering and dual sourcing. To create more resilience beyond that, we're working directly with our technology manufacturers to firm up allocations well into 2022 and beyond. We've dedicated teams to accelerate product redesign rounds around components that are unavailable or nearing the end of life, and we're taking advantage of this opportunity to take strategic actions around SKU rationalization. One more thing to mention, albeit with a slightly greater time horizon, there's been a lot of discussion about cross border supply chains. Our developed markets largely depend on global supply chains. What we've seen is that in several cases, the current challenges aren't hitting our emerging markets nearly as hard, simply because we have well established localization strategies there. So to that point, we'll continue to drive our strategy of making where we sell, always evaluating the benefit of shortening domestic supply chain. Patrick, that's the overview. Of course, I'm happy to go into more detail perhaps in response to questions when we get to Q&A.\nPatrick Decker: Thank you, Tony. So now turning from supply to demand. It's essentially the opposite story. Bidding pipelines are very active, orders pace continues to be at risk and we are not seeing project cancellations. We're staying as close to our customers as we are to our suppliers and doing everything we can to keep them served and, in turn, to help them serve their communities. Just last week, we had about 500 of our customers join us at our annual Xylem Reach User Conference. These are utility operators who are at the forefront of digitizing their networks with AMI and advanced analytics. What we continue to hear from them is that the value they're getting from these technology deployments continues to grow. In the short term, supply constraints are top of mind for nearly all of them. And from their vantage point, they're seeing the same challenges industry wide, so they're being patient and staying as flexible as possible. On longer term demand, the trends driving the water sector are more durable than the causes of today's supply headwinds. One example is the growing market for sustainable solutions. A month ago, we announced Xylem's commitment to net zero greenhouse gas emissions and to science based targets. Over the next two weeks, the water sector will be turning out in force at the COP26 Climate Conference in Glasgow to encourage utilities around the world to do the same. Xylem will be sharing platforms at COP utility leaders as they call on their peers to also make net zero commitments with the aim of decarbonizing the entire sector. More than 65 water utilities around the world have already done so and it's a movement that's gaining momentum, which is just one reflection of the trend toward technologies that affordably decarbonize water systems. Turning back to the near term drivers in our end markets, I'm going to hand it back over to Sandy to share some detail on what we're seeing and to lay out our guidance for the balance of the year.\nSandy Rowland: Thanks, Patrick. The full year outlook for our end markets remains largely consistent with our view from last quarter, with the exception of utilities. In utilities, underlying demand for our technologies continues to be very strong in both wastewater and clean water. But in the immediate term, we expect growth will come down from a range of mid to high single digits to flat. On the wastewater side, we have seen steady performance in Western Europe on resilient utility OpEx and continued growth in Emerging Markets as a result of large capital projects and our localization efforts there. Order rates remain solid in the US but revenue growth is challenged by constraints on volume. On the clean water side, demand for smart water solutions and digital offerings continues to be robust. However, consistent with our earlier commentary, the impact of chip shortages is particularly acute in the clean water end market. And now please turn to Slide 11. Looking at the industrial end market, we continue to anticipate growing in the high single digits. The growth is broad based with rebounding industrial activity across all segments and most regions. We're seeing healthy demand in our industrial de-watering business in Emerging Markets as well as share gains with OEMs, and the impact of the new product introductions in Western Europe. We're also seeing continuing strength in marine and food and beverage, driven by ongoing recovery in outdoor recreation and the hospitality sector. We are also maintaining our high to mid single digit outlook in the commercial end market. The US business continues to recover at a brisk pace as new commercial building begins to ramp, and key leading indicators reflect optimism for continuing recovery in the institutional sector. Sustained growth in Western Europe and China is coming from new product introductions and energy efficiency mandates. In residential, we're maintaining our expectations of low teens growth for the full year on strength of backlog and continuing market momentum. And now let's turn to Slide 12 and I'll walk you through our updated guidance. For Xylem overall, we now see full year organic revenue growth in the range of 3% to 4%, down from the previous range of 6% to 8%. This reflects the adverse effects of chip shortages and other supply chain disruptions. This revenue guidance breaks down by segment as follows. For Water Infrastructure, we maintain our expectations of mid single digit growth. We expect high single digit growth in Applied Water, down from low double digits. And in Measurement & Control Solutions, we now expect to be down mid single digits rather than up mid single digits. We are now expecting EBITDA margins in the range of 17.1% to 17.4% compared to our previous guidance range of 17.2% to 17.7%. This guidance represents full year margin expansion of roughly 100 basis points. Our adjusted EPS guidance is now $2.40 to $2.50 which, at the midpoint, reflects 19% increase in EPS over last year. Full year 2021 free cash flow conversion is in line with previous guidance at 80% to 90%, putting our three year average right around 130%. We've provided you with a number of other full year assumptions to supplement your models. Those assumptions are largely unchanged from our original guidance. We have updated our euro to dollar conversion rate assumption for the fourth quarter from 1.18 to 1.16. And as you know, foreign exchange can be volatile so we've included our typical foreign exchange sensitivity table in the appendix. Now before wrapping up, let me share some thoughts on our fourth quarter outlook. We anticipate total company organic revenues will be down roughly 4% to 6% in the quarter. This includes flattish growth in Water Infrastructure and Applied Water and M&CS down high teens. We expect fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA margin to be in the range of 16% to 17%. And with that, please turn to Slide 13 and I'll turn the call back over to Patrick for closing comments.\nPatrick Decker: Thanks, Sandy. Just in the last couple of days, we've been recognizing Xylem's 10-year anniversary. The Xylem ticker started trading a decade ago when the company spun out of ITT. Some of you have been with us since the very beginning, and I want to say thank you for your confidence in us. 10 years ago, it wasn't nearly as obvious to the market that water was an investable thesis, much less than it was about to become a growth sector. Our anniversary has been a reminder to reflect on how much progress we've made. I genuinely believe our team has created something special. And along the way, we've been creating a lot of value. Xylem's total shareholder returns have been nearly double the S&P 500 over the decade. But what's most exciting to us are the opportunities that lie ahead. The immediate challenge around supply chain are a good reminder that growth rarely happens in a straight line. But the trends driving demand in the water sector are only intensifying and we're strongly positioned on those trends. We have an outstanding purpose driven team that's passionate about solving the world's water challenges. We built technology leadership on the foundation of a durable business model. We're benefiting from the growing market for sustainable solutions, and we're driving growth and margin expansion on the back of digitization. All of which underpins our commitment to the growth framework that we laid out last month at our Investor Day. So I'm confident that our current market momentum will carry us strongly into 2022 and beyond and keep us on pace to deliver our 2025 strategic and financial milestones. Now let's turn the call over to you, and we're happy to take any questions you may have. Operator, please lead us into Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Scott Davis with Melius Research.\nScott Davis: It's a busy day here, but the comments on chip shortage are not unique just to you guys. But can you help us understand, particularly with Tony on the line here, I mean, how does this work? Do you know when you're getting chips in? Do you have visibility around deliveries? Do we get a bunch of them in January and then you're able to make deliveries in 1Q of next year? I mean, just help us understand a little bit about how you think about when you get chips and when you can actually -- and visibility around that?\nTony Milando: I mean, we deal with our contract manufacturers and our electronic suppliers. We give them forecasts and it's very similar to the way we deal with all of our materials. We provide forecast in advance. We're committing forecasts out over a 12 to 24 month horizon depending on the component. So it's not very different than anything else we do in terms of how we get supply in, no more complicated than that.\nPatrick Decker: I think, Scott, to your question also, how quickly will this snap back? And Tony, maybe you can comment on that because we don't see this being, all of a sudden to your question, Scott, in the month of January, a bunch of chips show up and the problem is resolved. It's going to be a bit of duration here as we work through the constraints. But Tony, do you want to comment on that?\nTony Milando: So there's a number of industries that are all clamoring, as you guys know, from the constraints, whether it's industrial or automotive or the personal electronics industry. So we're all looking for the same things. And so we are working very closely with our contract manufacturers and directly with our technology manufacturers, the IDMs, to make sure that they understand our demand and what they're committed to and we're looking to get those in over the course of the next 12 to 24 months. And so we anticipate it to get better. We don't know when that's going to get better but it will certainly -- we certainly do expect to get better as we move into next year.\nPatrick Decker: And I think, Scott, there are a number of people that are out there right now that are prognosticating on when this is going to get resolved. And there are different views across the board. What we're trying to do is to give you a very balanced responsible view because there still is uncertainty. And Tony and the team are working their backsides off to make sure that we get, hopefully, more than our fair share of allocation of the chips. And again, we'll know more about that as we come back around in our Q4 earnings call.\nScott Davis: And when you miss a shipment to a customer, I presume that moves into backlog at that point? Or at that point, does the customer have the right to cancel and perhaps goes to somebody else? I mean, are the lost revenue risk, I mean mechanically help us understand that.\nPatrick Decker: So yes, we've not seen any project or order cancellations. Things are moving to the right. The reality is our competitors are dealing with the same issues. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, customers are being patient because they're seeing this as an industry wide issue. And when you think about the criticality of what we do here for, especially utilities, it's a comment I made about our Reach User conference. We got a lot of really good feedback from, again, more than 500 attendees there. And they understand the situation. So things move to the right. And I mean, do they have the right, in some cases, to cancel? Certainly, but they don't have other alternatives right now to go for.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Maybe you could just give us more color on overall how you're thinking about getting ahead of cost pricing productivity. I know you've previously mentioned you raised price a number of times. Do you think you can get ahead of inflation, logistics costs as you turn the calendar into '22 with pricing and productivity?\nSandy Rowland: Let me give you a little bit of color. First of all, we are seeing the price realization come through as we expected. So we expected to start seeing that tick up in Q3 as we work through some of the backlog of earlier orders. And we do expect that momentum to continue to accelerate into Q4 and into 2022. When I look at where we stood in the third quarter, if you look at price and material and freight costs as a basket, we're neutral. And as we move into Q4, we expect that will be modestly positive.\nAndy Kaplowitz: And then I wanted to follow up on Tony's prepared remarks where he mentioned that Xylem is better positioned in Emerging Markets because it is very local for local supply chain, whereas in developed markets, maybe a little more of a global supply chain. So could you give us a little more color on what could be done to improve localization in developed markets? Does that mean a ramp-up of investment here in the US, for example?\nTony Milando: So first of all, our underlying strategy is to make where we sell. So while in Emerging Markets, we're highly localized there, we're pretty substantially localized also in Europe and in the US from a manufacturing perspective. But we will continue to move in that direction to bring local supply to those regions where the business case makes sense. So we are less localized in the US and in Europe but we're still substantially supporting those regions by in-region supply chains basically.\nPatrick Decker: And there's definitely not a -- you should not expect, Andy, to see any significant uptick in either OpEx or CapEx to address localization in the US. This is not a material thing. It's more working with our suppliers and our third-party manufacturers to have them work with us to move that on an accelerated basis.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.\nDeane Dray: It sounds like the supply chain conditions have worsened. This is true sector wide, so no surprises there. But since your Analyst Day a month ago, you had sized $100 million of revenues that would be pushed some into 4Q and some into 2022. Where does that stand? Just your best calculation, how much did it end up getting pushed? It sounds like it was more than $100 million.\nSandy Rowland: Deane, I think let me size it up. I think 30 days ago, we thought that we'd have somewhere between $35 million and $40 million impact in the third quarter. We saw about $50 million impact in the third quarter. About half of that was related to chip shortages and the other half related to sort of other supply chain delays. As things tighten, we've probably sized Q4 right around $120 million. And the greatest impact will be, again, on the chip side. And that's why you see the guide in our M&CS business down in Q4 quite a bit.\nDeane Dray: And if you just step back, it really does sound like the meter side of your business is most impacted because that does have exposure to semiconductors. So if you think about the shortfall, how much of that is centered in your meter business?\nSandy Rowland: When I look at Q3 and Q4 combined, I'd say about 65% of the impact is in our metrology business.\nPatrick Decker: And the large majority of that impact, Deane, in Q4 is the metrology business. And again, it's not a demand issue, so it's simply shifting to the right. And something I don't think we shared in our prepared remarks but it's important, I think, for everyone to see is when you look at the, whether it be the issues around getting access to chips, whether it be the port delays, the logistics challenges, the margin on our backlog which has shifted to the right is equally as attractive as we had laid out at Investor Day. And so we're not giving up margins to chase volume here and that's where I think the partnership with our customers has been really, really important.\nDeane Dray: And how about -- just to stay on that backlog margin thought for a moment. Are you doing any, like, partial assemblies? We're hearing companies that are just lining up partial, nearly completed products in the hallways and so forth. And the reason this is important is when you do end up shipping those in the following quarter, you've already expensed a portion of that assembly and labor and so forth, so it actually goes out with decent margins. But just are you doing partial assemblies and where does that stand?\nTony Milando: Yes, we absolutely are. You'd see our inventory ticked up a bit and part of that is a result of parts coming in being rescheduled but also prebuilds with waiting for those extra parts to come in so we can ship them out. So we're absolutely doing that.\nDeane Dray: And Tony, I love the color about using smaller ships and different ports. We're hearing about other companies doing that, so we applaud those efforts and keep up the good work.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Saree Boroditsky with Jefferies.\nSaree Boroditsky: The de-watering business and Water Infrastructure seemed like it was really strong. Can you provide more color on how you're thinking about demand in that business going forward, and should that be a tailwind for margins?\nSandy Rowland: When we look across the portfolio and within our Water Infrastructure business in the third quarter, this was a bright spot for us. We saw 8% growth in the quarter. On revenue, we saw strong orders and the cost structure in this business, when we do get growth, it helps us from a margin perspective. So I do want to shout out Emerging Markets doing really well in this business. We're seeing good strength in mining and some of the other industrial markets. And that's been a key part of our growth.\nPatrick Decker: And it definitely is. It's one of the highest kind of margin accretive businesses in the portfolio when we get that volume growth, so that certainly will help us as we go into '22.\nSaree Boroditsky: And then just sticking with M&CS. How does pricing work on some of these long term contracts? Will we be able to get price for some of the supply chain inflation that you're currently seeing within the current backlog?\nSandy Rowland: So I think this is -- we're pretty well positioned here. The way most of our M&CS contracts work, the longer term ones, there are escalator clauses embedded in those contracts where we look at a basket of price indexes and then we're able to adjust our prices based on where the index is.\nPatrick Decker: And this is a historically consistent situation that we've seen in the past when there had been periods of upticks in inflation or supply challenges. And part of the reason why we have that flexibility is, again, we're not in this alone. Our competitors are also dealing with supply challenges. But two, it also is the fact that these deals, when they've been approved by regulators and authorities, are being approved because they're going to be generating significant revenue for utility. So it's in their best interest to go ahead and move these things forward even if they have to wait or take on some adjustment in price escalation. It really comes down to what our overall value proposition is with those utilities.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Andrew Buscaglia with Berenberg.\nAndrew Buscaglia: So I guess, the margin dynamics impacting M&CS, but can you talk a little bit about -- you did so well in Water Infrastructure on margins. Applied Water was just a little bit below what I was thinking. So I guess, what are the differences there that would impact margins between those two segments?\nSandy Rowland: So I think there's a couple of dynamics. One was one of the points that we talked about through an earlier question. You saw the uptick in the dewatering business and that's good mix for us, so that helps margin. I think the other impact was there's some differences in inflation impacts between what we saw, for example, in our Water Infrastructure business and our AWS business. So it was more modest in our Water Infrastructure business.\nAndrew Buscaglia: And you talked about utility weakness. I'm wondering, are you seeing any initial signs of hesitation around spending, given that this infrastructure stimulus seems to be dragging on, we don't have quite the clarity we thought we'd have at this point in this year?\nPatrick Decker: No, we've not seen any signs of that and our bidding pipeline continues to be very robust. And again, the conversations that we had with, again, these 500 plus utilities at our Reach Conference, which is not just around metrology, this actually -- beginning of last year was the first time we had turned that into a Xylem Reach conference, it used to be Census. And so the conversations we're having with utilities there are across the entire portfolio of solutions. I've said before, I think that there is historically not really ever been of reliance at the utility level on federal government subsidization or funding, so nobody is kind of relying on that in a significant way. Again, the orders activity in the US was up very, very strong. And again, it really just comes down to some of the port and shipping delays that we're working through. But we've seen no hesitation in demand or order outlook.\nAndrew Buscaglia: So those orders just keep you confident that the demand's still there, I guess, as long as we don't see cancellations, that you feel confident there?\nPatrick Decker: That's correct. And again, I would reinforce that it's not just the orders in the backlog but it's the margin on those orders in the backlog that remains robust.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Nathan Jones with Stifel.\nNathan Jones: I just wanted to go back to [M&CS] for a minute, just under $320 million of revenue in the third quarter. The guidance looks like it's maybe $300 million of revenue or slightly below that. Is that kind of the level of revenue that you're restricted to with these chip shortages, logistics shortages, and that's the way we should think about at least the next couple of quarters, three quarters until some of this stuff starts to loosen up, or are there product redesigns or other things that you can do to try and boost that in the short term?\nSandy Rowland: I think, Nate, if you look at our guide for Q4, we're right in that neighborhood. We think that over time, the chip supply is going to improve and so that will gradually ramp. I think we've also seen some strength in some of our other businesses outside of metrology, which have opportunity to grow sooner than that. So assessment services is part of our portfolio. Our test business is a key part of that portfolio with really good margin structures. So we can grow there. The chip supply will constrain us over the next couple of quarters but we do expect that to gradually recover.\nPatrick Decker: And again, Nate, again, I go back, this is not a demand issue. So it's simply a matter of when we're able to convert these orders into revenue. And again, we're not seeing any signs of cancellations, and the margins remain strong. So I know you've heard me say that a number of times this morning but I think it's an important point to reiterate.\nNathan Jones: No, I'm just trying to get an idea of what the first half of '22 might look like in M&CS\u2026\nPatrick Decker: And Nate, we're trying to give you a responsible prudent view. There is a fair amount of uncertainty out there, not around backlog or margins but we're trying to -- again, we're trying to be balanced here.\nNathan Jones: Yes, it's about getting it out the door and not getting the orders in the door.\nNathan Jones: On the localizing supply chains question that people have been asking about, I mean, the contract manufacturing that you're doing and the importing that you're doing, I assume it's mostly on the technology side and it's coming from Asia to Europe and the US. Is it even possible to localize that manufacturing? Are there suppliers that you could leverage in the US and Europe to localize that? Is it just cost prohibitive because they're much higher cost than Asian suppliers would be? Just is it even possible to do that?\nTony Milando: So our large contract manufacturing -- we use contract manufacturers everywhere, but the largest one that we have is in Mexico actually, and so that's really supporting our US business. So it's largely the assembly and some of the componentry is localized here. Now granted, the electronics are coming from Asia and so we continue to look at possibilities to bring that closer. That will be a bit -- I mean, that's not something that we're looking to do necessarily but that's largely localized right now.\nNathan Jones: Is it just not possible to localize that from Asia?\nTony Milando: On the chip side, it will be something that I think we'll wait for the supply base. The supply base is a little thin for chip suppliers in North America, so most of that still comes from Asia.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Connor Lynagh with Morgan Stanley.\nConnor Lynagh: I wanted to return to Water Infrastructure and I wanted to clarify a comment you made before. Obviously, orders have been very strong within that business and I think you called out the de-watering business, in particular, as an area of strength. But is that the main driver of the significant increase in orders this year or are there other areas that you would point to?\nSandy Rowland: In orders growth, the orders growth has been really across the board in Water Infrastructure. It's impacting -- we're seeing good growth on the treatment side and the largest part of our business is transport, and so orders there have also been very strong.\nConnor Lynagh: And then just thinking through that strength, I mean, this might actually be a better question for just the whole company, but you called out some change in the typical order intake to actual revenue conversion or shipment timing. I'm curious how different that looks versus history, because basically the order intake would suggest that 2022 is going to be quite a good year for a lot of the segments but just hoping you could sort of frame how we should risk that relative to history.\nPatrick Decker: We won't comment yet on '22. We'll come back around to that in our next earnings call as we give guidance for '22. But yes, we do not have a demand issue here in Water Infrastructure. And the challenges that we saw in Q3 and we're weathering in Q4, we do believe to be more transitory and it really was around, again, some of the port delays and other freight challenges and shortages. So we think we'll get through those over the coming months here. And yes, we feel good about Water Infrastructure going into '22.\nSandy Rowland: And I think the other question you had was about conversion time between when orders get placed and when it converts to revenue. And certainly, there is an increase in demand, strong demand. You don't put up orders growth of the magnitude that we're posting. But we do acknowledge, everybody is recognizing that lead times are getting longer across the board. And so there is a bias for customers to put their orders in a little bit earlier than they usually have.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James.\nPavel Molchanov: You alluded to the fact that everybody is in the same boat in terms of supply chain complications. With that in mind, are you seeing any distressed M&A opportunities in terms of acting as a consolidator with regard to some smaller players for whom these supply chain issues are perhaps even more problematic than they are for blue chips?\nPatrick Decker: We definitely see ourselves as being in a privileged and strong position from an M&A standpoint, whether it be, again, our financial wherewithal, our bandwidth to do M&A, both financial and human, the balance sheet. And so we still remain very confident on that front. I don't know that I would say that the chip shortage and supply chain challenges are necessarily unlocking any opportunities that we would not have already had in our pipeline. We remain continued focused on what our priorities are strategically in that area. And that really is around, we see some opportunities to do some bolt-ons with utilities. Industrial, commercial building continue to be areas that we are very positive and very focused on. Again, it takes two to tango. And so again, we'll keep you updated on that. We're very confident. We're very excited about the M&A pipeline. But I wouldn't say it's changed dramatically because of the supply chain situation.\nPavel Molchanov: A quick follow-up on the opportunity in Europe. Obviously, a lot of emphasis on the reconciliation and the infrastructure builds in Washington. But given that the European Union Fit for 55 package is already finalized and very much being implemented, I'm curious if you've seen a pickup in customer activity orders from the EU within the context of their climate policy.\nPatrick Decker: I would say that not in the immediate term, although, I would say we are hearing more and more discussion around that. And so we see that as being an opportunity a bit further out. And I think even the conversations around COP26 are providing a backdrop. And as I mentioned in my opening comments, we're going to be very prominent there as is the water sector. And so we do think that, that bodes well for demand but it's down the road. It takes time for these to convert into orders.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Brian Lee with Goldman Sachs.\nBrian Lee: I know you all alluded to this, but I just wanted to understand a little bit more. If I look across the three segments, it seems like price hasn't read out as much in M&CS versus Water Infra and Applied Water. You mentioned sort of the inflation escalators in some of the contracts and then some of the, I guess, regulators stepping in and approving those. But can you sort of give us a sense of the time line for that, is that sort of an annual review? And then if you do have unregulated utilities in your mix for the meter business, is the construct the same or is that case by case?\nSandy Rowland: So one thing I think to level set. If you look at, first of all, inflation where it hit us the hardest, it has been outside of our M&CS business. It's been higher because of the types of commodities that we purchased that we've seen greater inflations in these other two segments. Those contracts have those escalator clauses. They come at different times and we are seeing favorable price coming through in M&CS.\nPatrick Decker: So just to add to that, Brian. When you look at our metrology business, which is where the largest majority of our longer term deals reside, we typically have price escalation clauses built into them and those are negotiated on a deal-by-deal basis. And so we expect that to roll through as those orders get implemented. And so we're less concerned around the margin expansion or price realization in that part of our company.\nBrian Lee: I guess that's sort of a segue into the second question I had. Just in general, there's been a lot of discussion here on the call around the chip shortages you're seeing. In terms of inflation, it does sound like it's less of an impact in that segment versus the others. Can you kind of give us a sense of what you're seeing there? And then at a company level, I think you're talking about seeing price costs go positive here in Q4. Would you say that's the same sort of time frame for M&CS or is that more into 2022 as you see price read out?\nSandy Rowland: Brian, I think I mentioned a little bit earlier on the call that across the company, we were neutral from a price cost perspective in Q3 and that we expected that to turn positive in Q4 as we're seeing price realization sort of ramp sequentially through the year. And so we feel like in the first part of 2022, we'll continue to see that trend as well. So our teams have worked really hard to be thoughtful and responsible as it comes down to price. This year, we've taken multiple price actions. When we look sort of at our expectations around where we thought inflation would be, we thought it would be across the company around 3% at the beginning of the year and it's going to turn out to be closer to 5% on an annual basis. And so that's been the reason we've gone out with these price increases to keep that in balance.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Ryan Connors with Boenning and Scattergood.\nRyan Connors: A couple of questions, sticking on the supply chain. I wanted to get your take on something that we've begun to hear just in the last week or so from some of the macro economists about sort of a surge in double ordering and even triple ordering in all sorts of products across the economy. And so I'm curious about what your take is on that on both sides of your business. Do you think there's any of that going on in terms of the orders that you're seeing from customers? And then on your side, are you doing any excess ordering and chips and other things to kind of stockpile supply to sort of place multiple orders, hope something gets through in time?\nPatrick Decker: I'll go first and then I'll have Tony talk about what we're doing on the ordering side ourselves. I would say where we've seen some of that uptick and people trying to get ahead of the supply chain constraints has actually been more around the port delays, the logistic challenges and some of those orders that we see, it's hard to put a specific number on it. But the order growth, I think, certainly in Water Infrastructure and most notably, Applied Water, some of that certainly, which is largely book-and-ship business, has been people trying to get ahead of the supply chain delays. Not that we aren't seeing any of that within M&CS but the large majority of that business, again, is driven really by some of these large deals and those orders converting. So there's some ordering in advance but it's less prominent there than it is within the other two segments. And Tony?\nTony Milando: And Ryan, I would just add that we're not doing double or triple ordering. What we are doing is working with multiple suppliers to try to get parts wherever we can, whether it's brokers or distributors or the IDMs. But I mean, that's a natural outcome of the bull up effect is to double and triple order and double down on these things. But we're not doing that here. We're just working with multiple suppliers.\nRyan Connors: And then my other one just had to do with another thing that's been in the news a lot in the quarter is sort of labor issues and strikes and some big industrial companies like Deere, for example. And your own financials reports say 17% of your US labor force is unionized, I believe most of that is census. Anything coming up there in terms of CBA negotiations or anything that you could share with us there?\nTony Milando: No, nothing with our unions. We have very good relationships with the unions around the world, particularly in the US. We are seeing labor tightness, as we mentioned earlier in the script, particularly in the US, not so much in Europe or Emerging Markets. But we're not anticipating any challenges with our unionized facilities.\nPatrick Decker: And I would just add there as well that where we are seeing some of the labor tightness is in some of our distribution locations around the US where we are in high-traffic distribution centers competitively, and that's obviously a very tight part of the labor market right now. So we've been taking actions to try to be more flexible, to try to get the workforce in, hiring ahead, knowing that we're going to have some natural attrition. But as Tony said, it's really not to do with our unionized workforce.\nOperator: And at this time, I will turn the call back over to Mr. Patrick Decker for any additional closing comments.\nPatrick Decker: Well, thank you all very much. Really appreciate your interest, your support. I know we've covered a lot here this morning. I look forward to our follow-up conversations with many of you and we'll see you on our next earnings call. And in the meanwhile, stay safe, stay well. And again, I just want to say thank you to all of you who have been a part of this journey of ours over the last 10 years as we celebrated yesterday our 10th anniversary of trading for the first time as Xylem. So thank you all very much and we'll be back in touch.\nOperator: Thank you. And this does conclude today's Xylem's third quarter 2021 earnings conference call. Please disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day.",

            "content": "Thank you, Patrick. Please turn to Slide 4, and I'll cover our Q3 results in more detail. Revenue grew 2% organically compared to the prior year. Utilities, our largest end market, was down 5% despite continuing strong demand. The decline was driven by supply chain impacts on order conversion, especially chip shortages, slowing M&CS deliveries. Industrial was up 11%, led by continued growth in Emerging Markets and Western Europe. Commercial grew 10%, led by the ongoing recovery in the United States, while residential, our smallest end market, was up 4%. Geographically, Emerging Markets was up high single digits, with particular strength in Eastern Europe and Latin America. Western Europe was up mid-single digits while the US declined modestly. As Patrick mentioned, the team delivered exceptional organic orders growth of 20%, which was broad based across all segments and regions. In fact, year-to-date order volume is higher at this point of the year than in any previous year in company history. M&CS led the way with nearly 40% -- 42% orders growth, driven by large smart metering contract wins, the impact of longer lead times and pent-up demand from a COVID-19 impacted prior year. We're exiting the quarter with an overall backlog of 34%. And as expected, we are seeing positive momentum on price realization, which will continue ramping through Q4 and into 2022. Looking at other key financial metrics. Margins were above our forecasted range with EBITDA margins coming in at 17.9%, reflecting strong productivity and good cost control by the team. Year-over-year, EBITDA margin contracted 30 basis points as inflation and strategic investments were largely offset by productivity, price realization and cost containment. Earnings per share in the quarter was $0.63. Please turn to Slide 5, and I'll review our segment performance for the quarter. In Water Infrastructure, orders were up 9% on strength in wastewater transport applications in the US and Western Europe. Revenues were up 2% organically. Wastewater Utilities were down modestly, mostly due to delays in ocean shipping. Industrial demand was broad based across all regions. Regionally, Emerging Markets delivered high single digit growth, led by increasing industrial dewatering activity. Western Europe was also up, driven by resilient wastewater OpEx spending and recovery in industrial applications. The US was down modestly due to the shipping delays I just mentioned. EBITDA margin expanded over the prior year as strong productivity savings, price realization and volume leverage more than offset inflation and investments. Please turn to Slide 6. In Applied Water, orders were up 17% organically in the quarter on broad industrial strength and commercial recovery. Revenue grew 8% in the quarter from continued commercial momentum and industrial growth in most regions. Residential growth moderated slightly due to volume constraints. Geographically, the US and Western Europe both contributed 6% growth due to the uplift from commercial and industrial. Emerging Markets were up 13% on continued strength in China and gains in Eastern Europe. Segment EBITDA margin contracted 60 basis points compared to the prior year as inflation and investments more than offset productivity benefits and price realization. And now please turn to Slide 7 and I'll cover our Measurement & Control Solutions segment. In M&CS, orders were up 42% organically as I mentioned a moment ago. Our M&CS backlog now stands at roughly $1.6 billion. The bidding pipeline remains very active as customer demand for advanced digital technologies accelerates. Organic revenue was down 5%, which is a tangible effect of chip shortages. Water applications were down modestly as growth in our test and assessment services businesses largely offset lower sales from smart metering. Due to the digital composition of our metrology portfolio, it has a greater exposure to chip shortages. By geography, Western Europe was up 1% while Emerging Markets was flat. The US was down mid single digits. Segment EBITDA margin in the quarter was down 60 basis points compared to the prior year as volume declines from component shortages and higher inflation offset productivity and price realization. And now let's turn to Slide 8 for an overview of cash flows and the company's financial position. Our financial position continues to be very strong. We closed the quarter with $1.3 billion in cash after paying down $600 million of debt in the third quarter. Free cash flow conversion was 57% in the quarter in line with our expectations, and we continue to expect full year free cash flow conversion of 80% to 90%. Net debt-to-EBITDA leverage was 1.3 times at the end of the quarter. And now please turn to Slide 9 and I'll turn the call back over to Patrick. Thanks, Patrick. The full year outlook for our end markets remains largely consistent with our view from last quarter, with the exception of utilities. In utilities, underlying demand for our technologies continues to be very strong in both wastewater and clean water. But in the immediate term, we expect growth will come down from a range of mid to high single digits to flat. On the wastewater side, we have seen steady performance in Western Europe on resilient utility OpEx and continued growth in Emerging Markets as a result of large capital projects and our localization efforts there. Order rates remain solid in the US but revenue growth is challenged by constraints on volume. On the clean water side, demand for smart water solutions and digital offerings continues to be robust. However, consistent with our earlier commentary, the impact of chip shortages is particularly acute in the clean water end market. And now please turn to Slide 11. Looking at the industrial end market, we continue to anticipate growing in the high single digits. The growth is broad based with rebounding industrial activity across all segments and most regions. We're seeing healthy demand in our industrial de-watering business in Emerging Markets as well as share gains with OEMs, and the impact of the new product introductions in Western Europe. We're also seeing continuing strength in marine and food and beverage, driven by ongoing recovery in outdoor recreation and the hospitality sector. We are also maintaining our high to mid single digit outlook in the commercial end market. The US business continues to recover at a brisk pace as new commercial building begins to ramp, and key leading indicators reflect optimism for continuing recovery in the institutional sector. Sustained growth in Western Europe and China is coming from new product introductions and energy efficiency mandates. In residential, we're maintaining our expectations of low teens growth for the full year on strength of backlog and continuing market momentum. And now let's turn to Slide 12 and I'll walk you through our updated guidance. For Xylem overall, we now see full year organic revenue growth in the range of 3% to 4%, down from the previous range of 6% to 8%. This reflects the adverse effects of chip shortages and other supply chain disruptions. This revenue guidance breaks down by segment as follows. For Water Infrastructure, we maintain our expectations of mid single digit growth. We expect high single digit growth in Applied Water, down from low double digits. And in Measurement & Control Solutions, we now expect to be down mid single digits rather than up mid single digits. We are now expecting EBITDA margins in the range of 17.1% to 17.4% compared to our previous guidance range of 17.2% to 17.7%. This guidance represents full year margin expansion of roughly 100 basis points. Our adjusted EPS guidance is now $2.40 to $2.50 which, at the midpoint, reflects 19% increase in EPS over last year. Full year 2021 free cash flow conversion is in line with previous guidance at 80% to 90%, putting our three year average right around 130%. We've provided you with a number of other full year assumptions to supplement your models. Those assumptions are largely unchanged from our original guidance. We have updated our euro to dollar conversion rate assumption for the fourth quarter from 1.18 to 1.16. And as you know, foreign exchange can be volatile so we've included our typical foreign exchange sensitivity table in the appendix. Now before wrapping up, let me share some thoughts on our fourth quarter outlook. We anticipate total company organic revenues will be down roughly 4% to 6% in the quarter. This includes flattish growth in Water Infrastructure and Applied Water and M&CS down high teens. We expect fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA margin to be in the range of 16% to 17%. And with that, please turn to Slide 13 and I'll turn the call back over to Patrick for closing comments. Let me give you a little bit of color. First of all, we are seeing the price realization come through as we expected. So we expected to start seeing that tick up in Q3 as we work through some of the backlog of earlier orders. And we do expect that momentum to continue to accelerate into Q4 and into 2022. When I look at where we stood in the third quarter, if you look at price and material and freight costs as a basket, we're neutral. And as we move into Q4, we expect that will be modestly positive. Deane, I think let me size it up. I think 30 days ago, we thought that we'd have somewhere between $35 million and $40 million impact in the third quarter. We saw about $50 million impact in the third quarter. About half of that was related to chip shortages and the other half related to sort of other supply chain delays. As things tighten, we've probably sized Q4 right around $120 million. And the greatest impact will be, again, on the chip side. And that's why you see the guide in our M&CS business down in Q4 quite a bit. When I look at Q3 and Q4 combined, I'd say about 65% of the impact is in our metrology business. When we look across the portfolio and within our Water Infrastructure business in the third quarter, this was a bright spot for us. We saw 8% growth in the quarter. On revenue, we saw strong orders and the cost structure in this business, when we do get growth, it helps us from a margin perspective. So I do want to shout out Emerging Markets doing really well in this business. We're seeing good strength in mining and some of the other industrial markets. And that's been a key part of our growth. So I think this is -- we're pretty well positioned here. The way most of our M&CS contracts work, the longer term ones, there are escalator clauses embedded in those contracts where we look at a basket of price indexes and then we're able to adjust our prices based on where the index is. So I think there's a couple of dynamics. One was one of the points that we talked about through an earlier question. You saw the uptick in the dewatering business and that's good mix for us, so that helps margin. I think the other impact was there's some differences in inflation impacts between what we saw, for example, in our Water Infrastructure business and our AWS business. So it was more modest in our Water Infrastructure business. I think, Nate, if you look at our guide for Q4, we're right in that neighborhood. We think that over time, the chip supply is going to improve and so that will gradually ramp. I think we've also seen some strength in some of our other businesses outside of metrology, which have opportunity to grow sooner than that. So assessment services is part of our portfolio. Our test business is a key part of that portfolio with really good margin structures. So we can grow there. The chip supply will constrain us over the next couple of quarters but we do expect that to gradually recover. In orders growth, the orders growth has been really across the board in Water Infrastructure. It's impacting -- we're seeing good growth on the treatment side and the largest part of our business is transport, and so orders there have also been very strong. And I think the other question you had was about conversion time between when orders get placed and when it converts to revenue. And certainly, there is an increase in demand, strong demand. You don't put up orders growth of the magnitude that we're posting. But we do acknowledge, everybody is recognizing that lead times are getting longer across the board. And so there is a bias for customers to put their orders in a little bit earlier than they usually have. So one thing I think to level set. If you look at, first of all, inflation where it hit us the hardest, it has been outside of our M&CS business. It's been higher because of the types of commodities that we purchased that we've seen greater inflations in these other two segments. Those contracts have those escalator clauses. They come at different times and we are seeing favorable price coming through in M&CS. Brian, I think I mentioned a little bit earlier on the call that across the company, we were neutral from a price cost perspective in Q3 and that we expected that to turn positive in Q4 as we're seeing price realization sort of ramp sequentially through the year. And so we feel like in the first part of 2022, we'll continue to see that trend as well. So our teams have worked really hard to be thoughtful and responsible as it comes down to price. This year, we've taken multiple price actions. When we look sort of at our expectations around where we thought inflation would be, we thought it would be across the company around 3% at the beginning of the year and it's going to turn out to be closer to 5% on an annual basis. And so that's been the reason we've gone out with these price increases to keep that in balance."

            "name": "Patrick Decker",
            "content": "Thanks, Matt. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. By now, you will have seen that the team delivered a solid third quarter performance with earnings and margins above our expectations. The fast pace of orders growth that we saw in the first half of the year has continued, with orders up 20% in the quarter, driving our backlog up 34%. That commercial momentum reflects strong underlying demand for our solutions, which continues to be robust in all segments, markets and geographies. Nevertheless, supply-driven constraints on volume slowed the conversion of orders to revenue. A month ago, we indicated a probable $100 million impact on full year revenue, driven by the global supply chain environment. The continuing shortage of electronic components, especially microcontrollers and other chips, is particularly affecting players with large digital solution businesses like Xylem, so we're reflecting those ongoing challenges in our full year view. Having raised guidance at the end of the first and second quarters, we now anticipate that the constraints on volume will moderate our full year revenue growth to between 3% and 4% and bring adjusted earnings per share into a range of $2.40 to $2.50, which represents roughly 20% EPS growth over last year. The growth in orders and EPS reflects the privileged position we're in. Macro trends in our sector are driving durable and increasing demand for sustainable digital water solutions. And the team is executing on a clear strategy to drive above market growth and expand margins as our portfolio continues to digitize. This quarter has been a vivid demonstration of those trends. The team has also shown its ability to capture that demand while showing real discipline on cost. Still, given the impact that supply headwinds are having on volume, we'll provide some additional color on what we're seeing and how the team is addressing those conditions. I've invited Tony Milando, our Chief Supply Chain Officer, to join us on the call today. But first, let me hand over to Sandy to look at the third quarter in more detail, and then we'll turn to a discussion of the market landscape that we see through the end of the year. Sandy, over to you. Thanks, Sandy. The team has clearly done a great job delivering a solid quarter's earnings in difficult circumstances. I want to give a special shout-out to our sales, service and supply chain teams. They've been pulling out all the stops to care for our customers despite the unusual challenges. Let's turn to the quarter now and look forward. Since the supply chain environment has everybody's attention, we want to provide more detail on what we're seeing and the actions we've been taking. So I've asked Tony Milando, our Chief Supply Chain Officer, to walk us through that. Tony, over to you. Thank you, Tony. So now turning from supply to demand. It's essentially the opposite story. Bidding pipelines are very active, orders pace continues to be at risk and we are not seeing project cancellations. We're staying as close to our customers as we are to our suppliers and doing everything we can to keep them served and, in turn, to help them serve their communities. Just last week, we had about 500 of our customers join us at our annual Xylem Reach User Conference. These are utility operators who are at the forefront of digitizing their networks with AMI and advanced analytics. What we continue to hear from them is that the value they're getting from these technology deployments continues to grow. In the short term, supply constraints are top of mind for nearly all of them. And from their vantage point, they're seeing the same challenges industry wide, so they're being patient and staying as flexible as possible. On longer term demand, the trends driving the water sector are more durable than the causes of today's supply headwinds. One example is the growing market for sustainable solutions. A month ago, we announced Xylem's commitment to net zero greenhouse gas emissions and to science based targets. Over the next two weeks, the water sector will be turning out in force at the COP26 Climate Conference in Glasgow to encourage utilities around the world to do the same. Xylem will be sharing platforms at COP utility leaders as they call on their peers to also make net zero commitments with the aim of decarbonizing the entire sector. More than 65 water utilities around the world have already done so and it's a movement that's gaining momentum, which is just one reflection of the trend toward technologies that affordably decarbonize water systems. Turning back to the near term drivers in our end markets, I'm going to hand it back over to Sandy to share some detail on what we're seeing and to lay out our guidance for the balance of the year. Thanks, Sandy. Just in the last couple of days, we've been recognizing Xylem's 10-year anniversary. The Xylem ticker started trading a decade ago when the company spun out of ITT. Some of you have been with us since the very beginning, and I want to say thank you for your confidence in us. 10 years ago, it wasn't nearly as obvious to the market that water was an investable thesis, much less than it was about to become a growth sector. Our anniversary has been a reminder to reflect on how much progress we've made. I genuinely believe our team has created something special. And along the way, we've been creating a lot of value. Xylem's total shareholder returns have been nearly double the S&P 500 over the decade. But what's most exciting to us are the opportunities that lie ahead. The immediate challenge around supply chain are a good reminder that growth rarely happens in a straight line. But the trends driving demand in the water sector are only intensifying and we're strongly positioned on those trends. We have an outstanding purpose driven team that's passionate about solving the world's water challenges. We built technology leadership on the foundation of a durable business model. We're benefiting from the growing market for sustainable solutions, and we're driving growth and margin expansion on the back of digitization. All of which underpins our commitment to the growth framework that we laid out last month at our Investor Day. So I'm confident that our current market momentum will carry us strongly into 2022 and beyond and keep us on pace to deliver our 2025 strategic and financial milestones. Now let's turn the call over to you, and we're happy to take any questions you may have. Operator, please lead us into Q&A. I think, Scott, to your question also, how quickly will this snap back? And Tony, maybe you can comment on that because we don't see this being, all of a sudden to your question, Scott, in the month of January, a bunch of chips show up and the problem is resolved. It's going to be a bit of duration here as we work through the constraints. But Tony, do you want to comment on that? And I think, Scott, there are a number of people that are out there right now that are prognosticating on when this is going to get resolved. And there are different views across the board. What we're trying to do is to give you a very balanced responsible view because there still is uncertainty. And Tony and the team are working their backsides off to make sure that we get, hopefully, more than our fair share of allocation of the chips. And again, we'll know more about that as we come back around in our Q4 earnings call. So yes, we've not seen any project or order cancellations. Things are moving to the right. The reality is our competitors are dealing with the same issues. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, customers are being patient because they're seeing this as an industry wide issue. And when you think about the criticality of what we do here for, especially utilities, it's a comment I made about our Reach User conference. We got a lot of really good feedback from, again, more than 500 attendees there. And they understand the situation. So things move to the right. And I mean, do they have the right, in some cases, to cancel? Certainly, but they don't have other alternatives right now to go for. And there's definitely not a -- you should not expect, Andy, to see any significant uptick in either OpEx or CapEx to address localization in the US. This is not a material thing. It's more working with our suppliers and our third-party manufacturers to have them work with us to move that on an accelerated basis. And the large majority of that impact, Deane, in Q4 is the metrology business. And again, it's not a demand issue, so it's simply shifting to the right. And something I don't think we shared in our prepared remarks but it's important, I think, for everyone to see is when you look at the, whether it be the issues around getting access to chips, whether it be the port delays, the logistics challenges, the margin on our backlog which has shifted to the right is equally as attractive as we had laid out at Investor Day. And so we're not giving up margins to chase volume here and that's where I think the partnership with our customers has been really, really important. And it definitely is. It's one of the highest kind of margin accretive businesses in the portfolio when we get that volume growth, so that certainly will help us as we go into '22. And this is a historically consistent situation that we've seen in the past when there had been periods of upticks in inflation or supply challenges. And part of the reason why we have that flexibility is, again, we're not in this alone. Our competitors are also dealing with supply challenges. But two, it also is the fact that these deals, when they've been approved by regulators and authorities, are being approved because they're going to be generating significant revenue for utility. So it's in their best interest to go ahead and move these things forward even if they have to wait or take on some adjustment in price escalation. It really comes down to what our overall value proposition is with those utilities. No, we've not seen any signs of that and our bidding pipeline continues to be very robust. And again, the conversations that we had with, again, these 500 plus utilities at our Reach Conference, which is not just around metrology, this actually -- beginning of last year was the first time we had turned that into a Xylem Reach conference, it used to be Census. And so the conversations we're having with utilities there are across the entire portfolio of solutions. I've said before, I think that there is historically not really ever been of reliance at the utility level on federal government subsidization or funding, so nobody is kind of relying on that in a significant way. Again, the orders activity in the US was up very, very strong. And again, it really just comes down to some of the port and shipping delays that we're working through. But we've seen no hesitation in demand or order outlook. That's correct. And again, I would reinforce that it's not just the orders in the backlog but it's the margin on those orders in the backlog that remains robust. And again, Nate, again, I go back, this is not a demand issue. So it's simply a matter of when we're able to convert these orders into revenue. And again, we're not seeing any signs of cancellations, and the margins remain strong. So I know you've heard me say that a number of times this morning but I think it's an important point to reiterate. And Nate, we're trying to give you a responsible prudent view. There is a fair amount of uncertainty out there, not around backlog or margins but we're trying to -- again, we're trying to be balanced here. We won't comment yet on '22. We'll come back around to that in our next earnings call as we give guidance for '22. But yes, we do not have a demand issue here in Water Infrastructure. And the challenges that we saw in Q3 and we're weathering in Q4, we do believe to be more transitory and it really was around, again, some of the port delays and other freight challenges and shortages. So we think we'll get through those over the coming months here. And yes, we feel good about Water Infrastructure going into '22. We definitely see ourselves as being in a privileged and strong position from an M&A standpoint, whether it be, again, our financial wherewithal, our bandwidth to do M&A, both financial and human, the balance sheet. And so we still remain very confident on that front. I don't know that I would say that the chip shortage and supply chain challenges are necessarily unlocking any opportunities that we would not have already had in our pipeline. We remain continued focused on what our priorities are strategically in that area. And that really is around, we see some opportunities to do some bolt-ons with utilities. Industrial, commercial building continue to be areas that we are very positive and very focused on. Again, it takes two to tango. And so again, we'll keep you updated on that. We're very confident. We're very excited about the M&A pipeline. But I wouldn't say it's changed dramatically because of the supply chain situation. I would say that not in the immediate term, although, I would say we are hearing more and more discussion around that. And so we see that as being an opportunity a bit further out. And I think even the conversations around COP26 are providing a backdrop. And as I mentioned in my opening comments, we're going to be very prominent there as is the water sector. And so we do think that, that bodes well for demand but it's down the road. It takes time for these to convert into orders. So just to add to that, Brian. When you look at our metrology business, which is where the largest majority of our longer term deals reside, we typically have price escalation clauses built into them and those are negotiated on a deal-by-deal basis. And so we expect that to roll through as those orders get implemented. And so we're less concerned around the margin expansion or price realization in that part of our company. I'll go first and then I'll have Tony talk about what we're doing on the ordering side ourselves. I would say where we've seen some of that uptick and people trying to get ahead of the supply chain constraints has actually been more around the port delays, the logistic challenges and some of those orders that we see, it's hard to put a specific number on it. But the order growth, I think, certainly in Water Infrastructure and most notably, Applied Water, some of that certainly, which is largely book-and-ship business, has been people trying to get ahead of the supply chain delays. Not that we aren't seeing any of that within M&CS but the large majority of that business, again, is driven really by some of these large deals and those orders converting. So there's some ordering in advance but it's less prominent there than it is within the other two segments. And Tony? And I would just add there as well that where we are seeing some of the labor tightness is in some of our distribution locations around the US where we are in high-traffic distribution centers competitively, and that's obviously a very tight part of the labor market right now. So we've been taking actions to try to be more flexible, to try to get the workforce in, hiring ahead, knowing that we're going to have some natural attrition. But as Tony said, it's really not to do with our unionized workforce. Well, thank you all very much. Really appreciate your interest, your support. I know we've covered a lot here this morning. I look forward to our follow-up conversations with many of you and we'll see you on our next earnings call. And in the meanwhile, stay safe, stay well. And again, I just want to say thank you to all of you who have been a part of this journey of ours over the last 10 years as we celebrated yesterday our 10th anniversary of trading for the first time as Xylem. So thank you all very much and we'll be back in touch."

            "name": "Tony Milando",
            "content": "Thank you, Patrick. I'm sure many of you are already familiar with the various dimensions of stress on the supply chain across all sectors. Material shortages are having at least some effect on each of our segments with particular challenges in microcontrollers and other chips. In addition, logistics times have continued to lengthen and carry reliability is at an all-time low. We're also seeing labor tightness in markets where we have significant manufacturing, particularly in the US. Of course, all of this has contributed to inflation across commodities, logistics and labor. We're managing the challenges with both short term mitigations and longer term actions. In short term, we're committing freight with carriers nearly two months further ahead than usual. We're using fast boat options to gain access to smaller ports and thus improve lead times. And we've accelerated value engineering and dual sourcing. To create more resilience beyond that, we're working directly with our technology manufacturers to firm up allocations well into 2022 and beyond. We've dedicated teams to accelerate product redesign rounds around components that are unavailable or nearing the end of life, and we're taking advantage of this opportunity to take strategic actions around SKU rationalization. One more thing to mention, albeit with a slightly greater time horizon, there's been a lot of discussion about cross border supply chains. Our developed markets largely depend on global supply chains. What we've seen is that in several cases, the current challenges aren't hitting our emerging markets nearly as hard, simply because we have well established localization strategies there. So to that point, we'll continue to drive our strategy of making where we sell, always evaluating the benefit of shortening domestic supply chain. Patrick, that's the overview. Of course, I'm happy to go into more detail perhaps in response to questions when we get to Q&A. I mean, we deal with our contract manufacturers and our electronic suppliers. We give them forecasts and it's very similar to the way we deal with all of our materials. We provide forecast in advance. We're committing forecasts out over a 12 to 24 month horizon depending on the component. So it's not very different than anything else we do in terms of how we get supply in, no more complicated than that. So there's a number of industries that are all clamoring, as you guys know, from the constraints, whether it's industrial or automotive or the personal electronics industry. So we're all looking for the same things. And so we are working very closely with our contract manufacturers and directly with our technology manufacturers, the IDMs, to make sure that they understand our demand and what they're committed to and we're looking to get those in over the course of the next 12 to 24 months. And so we anticipate it to get better. We don't know when that's going to get better but it will certainly -- we certainly do expect to get better as we move into next year. So first of all, our underlying strategy is to make where we sell. So while in Emerging Markets, we're highly localized there, we're pretty substantially localized also in Europe and in the US from a manufacturing perspective. But we will continue to move in that direction to bring local supply to those regions where the business case makes sense. So we are less localized in the US and in Europe but we're still substantially supporting those regions by in-region supply chains basically. Yes, we absolutely are. You'd see our inventory ticked up a bit and part of that is a result of parts coming in being rescheduled but also prebuilds with waiting for those extra parts to come in so we can ship them out. So we're absolutely doing that. So our large contract manufacturing -- we use contract manufacturers everywhere, but the largest one that we have is in Mexico actually, and so that's really supporting our US business. So it's largely the assembly and some of the componentry is localized here. Now granted, the electronics are coming from Asia and so we continue to look at possibilities to bring that closer. That will be a bit -- I mean, that's not something that we're looking to do necessarily but that's largely localized right now. On the chip side, it will be something that I think we'll wait for the supply base. The supply base is a little thin for chip suppliers in North America, so most of that still comes from Asia. And Ryan, I would just add that we're not doing double or triple ordering. What we are doing is working with multiple suppliers to try to get parts wherever we can, whether it's brokers or distributors or the IDMs. But I mean, that's a natural outcome of the bull up effect is to double and triple order and double down on these things. But we're not doing that here. We're just working with multiple suppliers. No, nothing with our unions. We have very good relationships with the unions around the world, particularly in the US. We are seeing labor tightness, as we mentioned earlier in the script, particularly in the US, not so much in Europe or Emerging Markets. But we're not anticipating any challenges with our unionized facilities."

Non-GAAP financials have been reconciled for you and are in the appendix of the presentation. Now please turn to Slide 3, and I will turn the call over to our CEO, Patrick Decker\nPatrick Decker: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. The call is starting a bit later in the morning than usual this quarter. So, by now, you will have seen that second quarter performance exceeded our expectations on all major metrics, including orders, revenue, margin, and earnings per share. I'm very proud of the team beating the healthy pace we set in the first quarter and just delivering a very strong first half of the year. Underlying demand for our solutions was robust across all segments and end-markets. The team did a great job converting that into better-than-expected performance and continuing to expand margin. They delivered even more exceptional results on orders, which grew 29% on underlying demand across all regions. In addition, backlog is up 35% versus this point last year, that broad expansion reflects commercial momentum that puts us in a strong position both now and into the future, as we continue to invest in sustainable growth. At the end of the first quarter, we raised full year guidance on revenue and earnings. The second quarter\u2019s performance shows a continuing strong trajectory into the second half. And we are reflecting that by further raising full year revenue guidance. The topline benefits are likely to be moderated somewhat by inflation and a challenging supply chain environment. But we've been proactive on price and are working with our supply chain partners to mitigate the impact of those headwinds. So, we are also raising the midpoint on earnings per share guidance for the full year. In a moment I'll provide some additional color on what we're seeing globally. But first, let me hand it over to Sandy to provide more detail on performance in the quarter.\nSandy Rowland: Thank you, Patrick. The second quarter offered a strong story of continuing demand recovery as revenue grew 11% organically compared to the prior year. We also saw momentum across most end markets on a quarter sequential basis. Utilities, our largest end market, was up 6% compared to the prior year, driven by clean water applications and continued wastewater utility OpEx demand. Industrial was up 17% on broad-based strengths as economies reopened and activity continued to ramp. Commercial grew 12% and also improved sequentially led by strength in the U.S. and Western Europe, while residential, our smallest end market grew 29%. Geographically, Western Europe and China were both up mid-teens with increasing demand seen across all end markets. The U.S. returned to growth with site access restrictions easing during the quarter. As Patrick mentioned, the team delivered exceptional organic orders growth of 29% on strong underlying demand across all segments and regions, with particular pace in M&CS, which grew orders 70% on large water metrology contracts. This is our fourth consecutive quarter of sequential orders improvements and it reflects higher orders growth than in the same period in 2019. Importantly, we exit the quarter with overall backlog ups 35%. Looking at the key financial metrics, margins were above our forecasted range with EBITDA margin coming in at 17.3%. The 200 basis points of year-over-year EBITDA margin expansion came largely from productivity volume and favorable mix, partially offset by inflation and investments. Earnings per share in the quarter was $0.66, which is up 65%. Please turn to Slide 5 and I'll review our segment performance for the quarter. Water Infrastructure delivered strong results during the quarter. Orders were flat, but up 22% excluding the large prior year deal in Telangana, India. Order intake was robust in treatment globally. Revenues were up 6% organically. Wastewater utilities remained resilient and we are now seeing recovery in the industrial end market. Geographically, emerging markets delivered mid-teens growth from industrial recovery driven in part by increasing mining demand in Latin America and Africa, while Western Europe delivered double digit girls from continued strong utility OpEx activities. In the U.S. healthy utilities OpEx demand reflected in strong orders growth, was offset by the lapping of prior year treatment project deliveries. EBITDA margin was in line with the prior year as strong productivity savings and volume effects, offset inflation and investments. Now please turn to Slide 6. The applied water segment had a very strong quarter driven by continuing market recovery across all regions and end markets. Orders were up 43%, organically in the quarter with particular strength in the U.S. and Western Europe. Revenue grew 18% in the quarter with double digit industrial demand driven by reopening activity, and especially in marine and food and beverage applications. Residential growth continues to be robust on strong market demand. Geographically, the U.S. was up double digits while yet Western Europe contributed 27% growth on increasing industrial demand. Emerging markets were up 24% due in part to broad industrial recovery and momentum in China. Segment EBITDA margin grew 200 basis points compared to the prior year. The expansion came from strong volume, leverage and productivity, more than offsetting material and freight inflation. Now please turn to Slide 7, and I'll cover our Measurement & Control Solutions segment. M&CS deliver a strong quarter as large project deployments began to ramp. We also realized gains in our industrial water quality testing business. Orders for the segment were up 70% organically on strong demand. Our M&CS backlog now stands at $1.5 billion, which is an historic high and almost 50% higher than at this time last year. We have secured more than $400 million in large contracts in the last 18 months. That reflects a number of major projects, which increasingly include our blotter digital solutions in combination with our core metrology application. Revenue was up 11% led by 17% growth in water applications, driven by large project deployments and double-digit growth in water quality applications. Energy applications were down modestly due to project timing and supply chain constraints. Unpacking the results by geography, emerging markets in Western Europe were up 20% and 25% respectively. The U.S. was up mid-single digits on strong demand for water quality applications and assessment services. As a reminder, for this segment in particular, growth rates can be uneven due to the impact of project timing. Segment EBITDA margin in the quarter was up 460 basis points compared to the prior year. Strong productivity savings from prior year restructuring actions, favorable mix and volume leverage more than offset inflation in investments. Now let's turn to Slide 8 for an overview of cash flows and the company's financial position. Our balance sheet continues to be very strong. We closed the quarter with $1.8 billion in cash and cash equivalents. In the third quarter, $600 million of senior notes will mature to be paid with cash. Free cash flow conversion was 172% in the quarter in line with our expectations and historical seasonality patterns. Net debt to EBITDA leverage was 1.3 times at the end of the quarter. Pease turn to Slide 9 and I'll turn the call back over to Patrick.\nPatrick Decker: Thanks Sandy. I want to touch on three areas briefly. Our operating discipline, our growth platforms and sustainability. On operating discipline, the team did an excellent job on margins in the quarter, delivering 200 basis points of EBITDA margin expansion year-on-year, in addition to quarter sequential improvement. We do anticipate some inflation and component supply challenges in the second half, but we're confident in our ability to manage through them and to mitigate their impact. Earlier, I noted our extremely healthy backlogs. As we've worked through these volumes, the team is doing a great job, making sure we manage the pressure on working capital this can create. In fact, despite serving spiking demand, we've improved working capital both year-over-year and quarter sequentially. As Sandy just mentioned, that performance puts us firmly on track to deliver our commitment on attractive free cash flow conversion. We clearly have significant capacity for capital deployment. On top of strong organic growth investment options, we have an attractive and active pipeline of M&A opportunities. Our growth platforms are an area we'll be delving into at our Investor Day in September, so I'm going to refrain from too much detail here today. I do want to draw attention to two things, however. Last quarter, we highlighted the pace of growth in emerging markets. This quarter, that pace has continued. Despite India's hard acceleration through the quarter due to COVID impact there. I'm very proud of the entire Xylem team's discipline and compassionate response in all countries affected by COVID, both in terms of our own operations and also how we've leaned in to support customers and help serve our communities. I also want to take a moment to draw a connecting line between our portfolio and some of the dramatic water-centric events we've been seeing recently around the world, by which I mean the flooding in Europe, China, and Central Asia and the drought in American West. These events reflect a trend as the effects of climate change become more and more apparent. And that trend requires an affordable response to keep communities safe, resilient, and water secure. So we continue to invest in specific technologies in our portfolio that respond to these challenges. As an example, automated wastewater network optimization is amongst our most advanced digital solutions. Its job is to manage overflows and prevent flooding. And our customer deployments are already preventing 1.4 billion cubic meters of water from flooding communities. Similarly, we also continue to innovate in the technologies that make communities more resilient to drought, technologies like leak detection, smart metering and especially water reuse. Already 1 trillion gallons of water are being recycled using Xylem technology, which brings me to the topic of sustainability more broadly. The numbers I just quoted come from our annual-sustainability report, which we published in June. And I think they bear out what we've said for some time. Our sustainability strategy is fundamental to our business strategy. We were pleased to report, for example, that almost half of our major facilities are now operating on 100% renewable energy, helping reduce our greenhouse gas emissions intensity by more than 7% year-over-year. Beyond our own footprint, our solutions have enabled our customers to reduce their carbon emissions by 700,000 metric tons last year. The report details progress on all of our signature sustainability goals and shows how sustainability is deeply embedded in who we are as a company. Now with that, I'll hand it back over to Sandy to provide commentary on our end markets and guidance for the remainder of the year.\nSandy Rowland: Thanks, Patrick. Our full-year outlook for our end markets remains largely consistent with our view from last quarter with some positive evolution as a few end markets are showing even faster recovery. In utilities, demand continues to be strong in both wastewater and clean water, affirming our anticipated growth of mid-to-high single digits. On the wastewater side, we have seen steady demand in Western Europe and North America as operators continue to focus on mission-critical applications while also investing in larger scale upgrades on affordable funding from capital markets. Bid activity and long-term capital spending outlook in emerging markets remains solid, though some COVID concerns linger in certain markets. On the clean water side, demand for smart water solutions and digital offerings continues to be robust as utilities increasingly turn their focus to more resilient infrastructure and affordable water delivery. Consistent with other technology companies, the connected nature of our solutions raises some risk in the second half, given prolonged supply chain constraints for electronic components. Our teams are working closely with our suppliers and manufacturing partners to optimize deliveries. Please turn to Slide 11. Looking at the industrial end market, where we had expected mid-single digits growth for the year, we are now anticipated growing in the high single digits. The growth is broad-based with rebounding industrial activity across all segments and regions. We're seeing upticks in demand, particularly in our industrial dewatering business in emerging markets. We're also seeing higher demand in marine and food and beverage, driven by recovery in outdoor recreation and the hospitality sector. We are increasing our outlook in the commercial end market as well. The U.S. replacement business is growing at a first pace. New commercial building is expected to lag the recovery somewhat, but key leading indicators reflect optimism for late 2021 recovery in the institutional sector. With growth in Western Europe and China sustained through the second half, along with modest share gains and supply chain resiliency, we now expect the commercial end market to be up mid-to-high single digits, up from the low single digits previously. In residential, we now anticipate low teens growth for the full year, up modestly from our previous expectations of high single-digit to low double-digit growth. We do expect growth will moderate through the second half, due largely to a more difficult year-over-year comparisons. And now let's turn to Slide 12, and I'll walk you through our updated guidance. As you can see, we are further raising our previous annual guidance. For Xylem overall, we now see full year organic revenue growth in the range of 6% to 8%, up from our previous guidance range of 5% to 7%. This confidence is based on clear demand recovery, combined with the pricing actions we are taking to offset inflation. This revenue guidance breaks down by segment as follows. For water infrastructure, we expect mid-single-digit growth from a previous expectation of mid-to-high single digits. We expect low double-digit growth in applied water, up from mid-to-high single digits. And in measurement & control solutions, we expect mid-single-digit growth. We also expect EBITDA margins in the range of 17.2% to 17.7%. This guidance represents full-year margin expansion of 120 basis points at the midpoint. That's grounded in a strong first-half performance with 300 basis points of expansion from restructuring savings on actions we took late last year, as well as volume leverage from the top line growth. The third quarter is more challenging, primarily driven by the timing of inflation and price realization. However, price realization will increase into the fourth quarter as we work through the large backlog built over the last several quarters. Overall, we expect strong second-half margins compared to the first half of the year. This yields an adjusted EPS guidance range of $2.55 to $2.70, reflecting increased confidence in our ability to lift the bottom end of the range while still managing through inflation and supply chain challenges. That range now reflects a 28% increase in EPS guidance at the midpoint over last year. We continue to expect full-year 2021 free cash flow conversion of 80% to 90% as previously guided, putting our three-year average right around 130%. We have provided you with a number of other full-year assumptions to supplement your models. Those assumptions are largely unchanged from our original guidance. However, one item worth noting is our updated assumption on foreign exchange for the second half of the year. Because of the recent dip in the euro and the disproportionate effect it had on our results, we've updated our euro to dollar conversion rate assumption for the second half from 1.22 to 1.18. This change, along with some other currency movements has a $0.04 negative impact on our second-half outlook. As you know, foreign exchange can be volatile, so we've included our typical foreign exchange sensitivity table in the appendix. Also, we are making an adjustment to our restructuring and realignment guidance from 50 million to 60 million to now 30 million to 40 million, while still expecting to realize similar restructuring savings due to high natural attrition and the timing of actions. And now before wrapping up, let me share some thoughts on our third-quarter outlook. We anticipate total company organic revenues will grow in the range of 5% to 7%. This includes mid-single-digit growth in water infrastructure, high single-digit growth in applied water, and low single-digit growth in M&CS. We expect third-quarter adjusted-EBITDA margin to be in the range of 16.7% to 17.2%, largely in line with our strong second quarter. While inflation and component supply are likely to present some headwinds in the third quarter, we are addressing them with the pricing and supply chain actions previously mentioned. And with that, please turn to Slide 13, and I'll turn the call back over to Patrick for some closing comments.\nPatrick Decker: Thanks, Sandy. The team has been doing an outstanding job capturing market demand, giving us exceptional orders and backlog growth. We expect to continue capitalizing on that underlying demand. And the team will manage through the near-term supply chain environment with the same spirit and discipline they've demonstrated through the many external challenges of the past year. Looking forward, trends toward new investment in infrastructure and particularly in the modernization of infrastructure are accelerating hand-in-hand with demand to make communities more resilient to climate change and to do it in a more affordable way. Those trends only reinforce the strength of our investment thesis, that our differentiated portfolio of leading technologies, addressing scarcity, resilience, and affordability will drive increased revenue growth and margins, and sustainable growth with strong cash flow generation and increased opportunity for capital deployment. This puts us in a privileged position to create both economic and social value for our stakeholders now and over the medium and long term. We are genuinely excited about providing an update on our strategy and long-term plans at our upcoming Investor Day, which is scheduled for September 30. It will be the first opportunity for many of you to meet all of our business leaders and our entire senior leadership team, especially those who joined us over the past year. So it's a great chance to provide a full-strategic update, including our long-term financial targets, and a deep dive into our vision of how digital solutions are transforming outcomes for our customers, including discussions with a few of those customers who've deployed some of our most advanced technologies. Matt and the team will follow up with invitations and logistical details in the coming days. Now let's turn the call over to you and are happy to take any questions you may have. So operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Michael Halloran with Baird.\nMichael Halloran: Hey, good morning, everyone.\nPatrick Decker: Hey, Mike. How are you doing?\nSandy Rowland: Hi, Mike.\nMichael Halloran: I'm all good. Thank you. So two questions on M&CS here. First, maybe just a little deeper dive on how you see that backlog conversion playing out? Obviously, a really nice sequential move in orders, really good commentary from an underlying perspective on what the underlying cadence, demand, et cetera, looks like. But you also have the supply chain challenges, shortages, things like that. How do you see that playing out right now in terms of site access, in terms of availability, in terms of when that next ramp or rollout really can start accelerating again?\nPatrick Decker: Yes, sure. Thanks, Mike. Great question. So yes, the backlog growth in M&CS specifically was about 49% in this past quarter. So a really good uptick. Really encouraged by a number of not just the large-deal wins that the team has achieved there, but also the base business, the day-to-day business grew quite nicely in the quarter, and we see good momentum there. We feel that the site access issues have certainly eased. I wouldn't say they're completely resolved, but they're certainly trending in the right direction. Where we're really seeing \u2013 and really, the primary challenge out there right now, which the team is all over working hard to mitigate that is some of the component shortages. And that's not limited to us. That really is not just across our sector, but as you all well know, broader sectors as well. But the team is all over. We're doing everything we can, whether it be kind of paying up for some components, making sure we lock in commitments around that. So we're very \u2013 we feel very good about the momentum. It really does feel like that part of our business is turning the corner in terms of converting things into backlog. We look at the margin in backlog, especially as we go into 2022 and feel very good about that, not just what they've achieved already this year. Again, challenges aside in the second half around component shortages, and those are real. They're not insignificant, but we're confident we can work through that. And it's shaping up very nice for 2022 and beyond.\nMichael Halloran: So you touched a little bit on it in the answer, but just dig a little deeper. Could you just talk about the mix of the backlog, how that's tracking versus some of the more digitally oriented and the newer solutions you're putting in the marketplace, broader approach there versus more traditional. And also thoughts on how you think the backlog margin is tracking out as well in comfort level given all the moving pieces?\nPatrick Decker: Sure. Yes. And I think on the \u2013 let me take the second one first. The margin on the backlog, we're confident about as we go into 2022 and beyond. Again, we've got this near-term challenge we're working through in Q3 and Q4 on component shortages, et cetera. But again, we're holding our own there. As it relates to the mix, we continue to see a real adoption of \u2013 even in these large metrology deals that we're doing, there is an ever-going increased component of that, that is digital. And so we're very encouraged by that. And we continue to see a number of really impressive wins on the branding that we call Xylem Vue, which is the purely digital kind of data-driven diagnostic capabilities. And so we're very encouraged in that area as well. But there's definitely a shifting mix toward the digital component.\nMichael Halloran: Great. Thank you for the time Patrick.\nPatrick Decker: We'll have more that we'll share on that at our upcoming Investor Day to kind of unpack and unbundle that for you all.\nMichael Halloran: Makes a lot of sense. Appreciate it.\nPatrick Decker: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.\nDeane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nPatrick Decker: Good morning, Deane. How are you doing?\nSandy Rowland: Good morning, Deane.\nDeane Dray: Hey. Doing real well. Thanks. Just like to pick up where we left off there on the supply chain. And it looks like you are managing through this based upon your margin success. We were expecting you to get some price increases in the second quarter, how did that play out? And then what's the expectation for second half on a price cost for the total company? Thanks.\nSandy Rowland: Yes. Thanks for the question, Deane. I think that we're very happy with how we've managed through the inflation dynamics through the first half of the year. And we were able to realize some incremental price in Q2. We do expect that, that will continue to ramp throughout the year. Just as a reminder, we're now up on our third price increase for the year. We got out of the gate early with a price increase in the first quarter because of the continuous rise in the commodity prices. We've then taken that decision to take two additional price increases. I think there is one unique dynamic that we're working through. The backlogs are a little higher than we typically find at any given period of time. And so the realizations, there's a little bit of a timing issue. But net-net, I think we're doing a good job here, and it will continue to ramp, particularly in the fourth quarter.\nPatrick Decker: Yes. And Deane, I would just offer that, so yes, as Sandy said, the most challenging time frame we say right now is really in Q3 because we did have this big bump in backlog. And so that's \u2013 we're shipping that out. We \u2013 there is price realization in there. But as you know, commodities especially have moved so quickly that we've gone out now and we'll go out again with further price increases. But we \u2013 as we look at the exit, especially in Q4, that really all comes back into complete equilibrium. And we are net positive at that point once again.\nDeane Dray: Great. Just a quick clarification. And, Patrick, I don't know if you were anticipating I was going to ask this question until you gave the partial answer earlier is in the orders, especially MC&S, the digital component, can you put a number just broadly? It doesn't have to be that precise, but how much of these orders have a digital component. And you can include Sensus and their smart meter part of that as well.\nPatrick Decker: Yes. No, absolutely. And I think, Deane \u2013 I'll give you an answer. And Deane, I think this is absolutely what we want to delve in a bit more at Investor Day. We really kind of want to lay out that baseline and that framework as to how we think about digital and what that kind of trend line is and what our metrics and incentives tied to that are. So much more to come at Investor Day. But just to put it in perspective, we've had, in the last 18 months, we've had $400 million roughly in large-deal wins. And that has had a significant digital component to it. And so that just gives you one sense of kind of proof point. And then there are a number of, again, really interesting projects and deals that we've won with what we call the Xylem Vue, which is, again, purely the diagnostic kind of consultative side of the business that we'll be highlighting at Investor Day. So we'll cover more of that on September 30. But hopefully, that gives you a bit of a flavor of that. There's a real meaningful adoption here on the digital side that we want to give the appropriate color to. We're very, very excited about it.\nDeane Dray: Of course, happy to wait until then for those specifics. And just last one for me on water infrastructure, just tempering the guidance on the top line going to mid-single digit. Just what are the key headwinds? And how would you calibrate those?\nSandy Rowland: Yes. I think it's a modest shift. I think we did take the water infrastructure guide up in the first \u2013 at the end of the first quarter, we initially guided to about a 4% increase. We took that up. I think we're very close in the same spot. It's largely unchanged.\nPatrick Decker: Yes. I think there's some timing of project delivery and some shipments. We had some pretty impressive comps versus last year. Deane, I wouldn't read anything into that. I mean, we're trying to be prudent just in terms of the guide for the second half. But there's nothing happening from a market standpoint that is changing our view on that segment. We're very confident. It continues to be very much in that healthy mid-single-digit kind of growth rate as we'd expect. And there, that also cuts across geographies, Deane. We're not seeing any kind of slowdown or shift in spending in the U.S. because of infrastructure discussion or any of that is just \u2013 again, it's trying to be prudent.\nDeane Dray: That's real helpful. Thank you.\nPatrick Decker: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Connors with Boenning and Scattergood.\nRyan Connors: Hey, thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to \u2013 not to beat the dead horse on the supply chain issues. But if you just want to drill down there. Some of the sort of peer companies have talked about sort of foregone revenue because it's so tough to get some components and things. But it sounds like you're not really saying that. You mentioned, Patrick, paying up for components. And it sounds like in your case, it's more of a \u2013 you're willing to take it on the margin side if you have to and to get the business and be able to shift the business. And it hasn't really been a revenue headwind leaving business on the table either in the past or in the second half. Is that a fair characterization of what I'm hearing or is it not?\nPatrick Decker: No, that's fair, Ryan. I mean, again, I'd be remiss if I didn't give a huge shout out to the team that's working through this because it is challenging. I mean it's not an insignificant challenge that they're trying to overcome at this point in time. But just to put some kind of parameters around this. And we estimate right now, we've probably moved roughly at least $20 million of revenue out of the second half of the year into 2022. Obviously, there's never any guarantee. Obviously, that comes with healthy margins. And so if it weren't for that, we would probably be talking about a further adjustment to our guide. But that's the reality that we are working through at this point in time. And it's not without risk. So our teams are working their backsides off in that regard. Yes, we don't feel that we are losing revenue from a competitive standpoint because we're all facing the same challenges. And this is a pretty sticky business. It's hard to swap out suppliers. So that's the right characterization, Ryan. Hopefully, a little bit extra color can be was helpful.\nRyan Connors: Yes, it certainly was. And then as a follow-on to that, you, at the corporate level, as well as all of your salespeople that you've given us all access to with the trade events and things, always talk about pricing for value as opposed to pricing for commodities. So how do you handle this weird environment where you're suddenly having to price for commodities? I mean, do you build in de-escalators if certain things go down in the future? I mean, it just seems like a very different discussion than you normally like to have around sort of pricing for value?\nPatrick Decker: Yes. No, you're absolutely right, Ryan. I mean we \u2013 the teams are continuing to remain primarily focused on pricing for value. And that, again, really tying back to, again, what are the customer outcomes that we're looking to achieve here in terms of helping them achieve their goals. And so we are getting better, I think, at pricing for value. I would say in these kinds of interesting environments, we were not really doing surcharges. So it's not like we're putting it out there where we have to dial it back later. And so we're trying to be disciplined in that regard. At the same time, we also dealt with this. It wasn't that long ago, we were talking about the tariffs and all the other interesting pricing challenges that we had to overcome. So again, I don't want to minimize the incredible hard work the teams are doing to deal with this pricing environment. But I'm very pleased and very proud of what they've accomplished thus far.\nRyan Connors: Okay. Good. And then I did have one last one. I didn't hear a two-question restrictions. So hopefully, I'm not in over here, but\u2026\nPatrick Decker: Two-question restrictions, Ryan.\nRyan Connors: I'll hop back in later. That's fine.\nSandy Rowland: No. Go ahead, Ryan.\nRyan Connors: Okay. Just a very big picture. But just obviously, stock is sitting at an all-time high. You've got a great currency. And we've seen this weird kind of valuation gap develop. You've got a great story to tell around ESG, maybe others do not. So this huge valuation gap has opened up. I mean, has there been any thought to how that influences your M&A strategy where you use that currency to raise capital? And kind of arbitrage that by some of these smaller companies who don't seem to be \u2013 have their ducks in a row on ESG and bring some of your best practices there? I mean is that something that you thought about?\nPatrick Decker: Absolutely, Ryan. I mean, it's a great point. But if I bring it back to center on that theme around kind of capital deployment, again, the pipeline is very active. It's \u2013 we believe there are things that are actionable there of different shapes and sizes. We absolutely would believe in using our currency in the right way and leverage that in the right way to go after really attractive strategic assets that are a good strategic fit. Obviously, we still are going to be disciplined around returns and it really is around growth, making sure it's accretive, making sure margins are accretive. There's a technology component, we believe it's very important that there is a services recurring revenue component that are very attractive. So those fundamentals don't change. But your question around using stock as a currency, that is something that we are very much open to in a disciplined way. And I like the point you made. I do believe that \u2013 and again, I'm very proud of what the entire team has done here on making sure that sustainability for us and the broader ESG is not just some kind of stand-alone thing. It's deeply integrated into our business. It's what we do as a company. And it's in our operating processes. We have incentives tied around it. And I do think that, that is an area of synergy as we look at other companies that we could bring into the portfolio. So I think a very good point in your part, Ryan.\nRyan Connors: Very well. Thanks. And thanks for letting me squeeze that one in.\nPatrick Decker: Sure. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Connor Lynagh with Morgan Stanley.\nConnor Lynagh: Yes. Thanks. I wanted to return to the orders, which obviously pretty much across all segments look very impressive. I'm curious \u2013 and I appreciate this is probably difficult to quantify, but I'm curious if you're seeing behavior from customers that would suggest that they are anticipating supply chain bottlenecks of their own? In other words, are you seeing over ordering? Or do you think this is just representative of very strong demand trends in a true underlying sense?\nSandy Rowland: Yes. Thanks for the question. I think, first of all, we are seeing great momentum on the orders front. And so we do believe that demand is coming back in a very sustainable way. I think if you break it down a little bit by our segments, I think in water infrastructure, in particular, we're probably seeing the most natural order flow and not really an acceleration or deviation from historical timing. When you shift over and look at AWS and M&CS where I think we're up 43% in AWS in the quarter and 70% in M&CS, there is true demand returning. But we are seeing customers try to get in line a little bit, whether it's ahead of longer lead times that we published, some incremental pricing actions that we've announced, or importantly, the supply chain components that we've talked about extensively on the call. All of that in combination is certainly impacting some of the buying behaviors. But I think the order momentum that we have is \u2013 we're really excited about, and we think it positions us well not only for the second half of the year, but as we look forward into 2022 and beyond.\nConnor Lynagh: Yes. That's helpful color. Thank you. Just on the guidance, water infrastructure is the loan area where you seem to revise down the view a little bit. I'm just curious if there's specific projects or specific regions that are driving that? And I guess how would you contrast that with the strong ordering activity that you've seen year-to-date? Is it more of just a temporary supply chain issue? Or is there something more significant underlying that?\nSandy Rowland: I think it's minor. We try to tighten the range a little bit as we move into the second half, but we did have some U.S. treatment orders that just got pushed out a little bit in \u2013 that we had in Q2 that have gotten pushed out, and some of that plays through the rest of the guide. But I think fundamentally, we're seeing good orders momentum in treatment. We're seeing good orders momentum in dewatering, and transport is \u2013 continues to be strong. So there's nothing there from an order perspective that gives us any concern. And I view it just as we're tightening the range a little bit as we move into the second half.\nConnor Lynagh: Make sense. Thanks. I'll turn it back.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones with Stifel.\nNathan Jones: Good morning, everyone.\nPatrick Decker: Hey, good morning, Nate.\nNathan Jones: I had a follow-up question on the MCS order rates. Obviously, all-time record, so fantastic stuff there. I know you guys account for that a little bit differently. You don't stick the entire order for a 10-year project into the backlog when you say that you need to have POs in hand to actually book it as an order. So can you talk about what's driving that? Is it the ramp-up of projects that you had previously won? Or are they orders here for new projects that you're just winning now?\nSandy Rowland: So I think great question, Nate. I think you've got the flow well understood. The first step for us is to bring something into our backlog. And we tend to see that around large metrology deployments. And as we get closer to the rollout phase, we start to see real orders that come in from our customers. And I think we're seeing a pop in the order rate because some of the large orders, large awards that we brought into backlog are starting to convert into orders now that some of the site access restrictions are easing. And some of it also is what I just answered before. We are seeing that some of the customers are trying to get in line sooner to get in front of some of the component shortages. But I think backlog is a leading indicator and the orders means that it's starting to \u2013 will start to convert into revenue in a more short-term basis.\nPatrick Decker: And I would add, Nate, it's not too much specifically in a reaction to your question on the order flow and so forth. But we didn't call out earlier. And I really do want to get a shout out to our team within M&CS that manages our analytics business. I mean they've been performing very well. It's really high margin, and that business really has been showing robust growth and strength. So that's \u2013 it doesn't move the numbers dramatically in the aggregate, but it's very rich in margin. And I'm very proud of what the team is doing there.\nNathan Jones: Great. I had a follow-up question on the restructuring expense and the high-natural attrition comment. I mean, obviously, you were looking to take some of those heads out anyway. But can you talk about whether or not you're worried at all about high-natural attrition if you're losing talent for one reason or another? And any steps you might need to take there to protect that talent base?\nPatrick Decker: Yes, Nate. It's again, another great question. I would say labor shortage, managing attrition, it is a challenge. It is a headache. It's something that I and management team worry about a lot. But it's not our primary challenge. I mean I think our primary challenge right now is, again, working through the component shortages and the supply chain challenges, which, in some cases, is an indirect impact of labor shortage, broadly speaking. I would say one of the areas also that we are very focused on is retaining some critical areas like software engineers, a very competitive landscape at this point in time. I mean we are focused on it. We feel that our \u2013 not only our purpose and mission as a company is very compelling for attracting and retaining a wide variety of talent. But two, we are continuing to look at some flexible areas that we can just drive further retention. Obviously, the pandemic has been hard on everyone around the world, and there is some dislocation occurring right now. And so we're being very thoughtful as to how we work through that. We built any of that incremental cost into our outlook, but that's something that we are going to continue to stay very close to because the talent is just so, it's so essential here in terms of what we're trying to accomplish.\nNathan Jones: Great. Thanks very much for taking my questions.\nPatrick Decker: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Graham with Rosenblatt Securities.\nScott Graham: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question.\nPatrick Decker: Hey Scott.\nMatt Latino: Hey Scott.\nSandy Rowland: Good morning Scott. \nScott Graham: So, couple of things if you said it, I didn't hear it. Did you \u2013 can you offer us a single point number for what pricing was?\nSandy Rowland: Yes, it's about 50 basis points in the quarter.\nScott Graham: Okay. And then to that end it looks like the pricing occurred in the Applied Water and M&CS segments, and it looks like water infrastructure pricing was negative. Is that true?\nSandy Rowland: In water infrastructure it's flattish. And then we did see that the greatest price realization within AWS, and that's where we're seeing some more of the commodity increases hit most rapidly. And we did see a little bit of pricing benefit in M&CS, which is tied into our contract terms with our customer. I think what's important to note is that we're going to see \u2013 we do expect incremental pricing benefits as we move through the year, and you're going to see that number rise in each of our upcoming calls.\nPatrick Decker: Yes, so, the other thing I'd add Scott is just and I think Sandy touched on this in her response to you was, we saw commodity inflation has not hit us equally or consistently in each aspect of our business. It really is a different issue of mix. And so obviously our pricing is driven by our views on not only selling value, but dealing with commodity inflation. So, we just saw more of that earlier on given the shorter cycle nature of our Applied Water business and because of some of the component shortages and other things in M&Cs. I'm not saying it was not an issue in water infrastructure. Our team would not be happy hearing me say otherwise they've dealt with it also. But it\u2019s just the timing of when those commodity inflation impacts would hit us. But we felt good about the run rate within each of the segments.\nScott Graham: Yes. Well, I have no doubt the price is going to get better. You guys have made that clear. I'm just wanting to stay on water infrastructure for one more second, then I have a quick follow-up. It would imply from the slide on \u2013 Slide 5, that mix was then negative in water infrastructure, right?\nPatrick Decker: That's right. So, Scott, we have \u2013 we did see watering return to growth, which was great to see. It was more in the sale of pumps into our channels than it was about the rental side, which would have driven higher incremental margin for us with just how rich that rental side is. So, it was really just a little bit of the mix of where we were seeing the return, particularly in the industrial side, you saw it in the emerging markets and you saw in some of the areas where we serve the mining sector. And it was a lot of pump sales as opposed to the rental, but we have seen rental start to come back here. I think that's something that \u2013 that could be something we see in the second half, particularly in North America as the construction markets and other areas get going.\nSandy Rowland: Yes. I think one thing is important to recognize if you look at water infrastructure, if you look at it quarter sequentially, we did see an uptick in margins as we move from the first quarter to the second quarter. And we think that they were well positioned on that front. \nScott Graham: Okay. And then my last question is Sandy, this is with you, I think, you said you are expecting strong margins in the second half, but flattish based on the construct of your guide. You would be happy with your second half margins, you pulling them strong, but I think the guide implies that they are essentially flat, right?\nSandy Rowland: Yes. So, I think if you look first half, second half, we expect higher margins in the second half of the year. If we look Q2 to Q3, those two quarters actually are shaping up to look very similar. They're about the same size from a revenue perspective. And our guide is very close to what we realized in Q3. And then we do expect it uptick in margins in the fourth quarter. But not as much year-over-year improvement in the second half. And I think that's very consistent with our guide for the year. We expect it to come out of the gate strong from a margin expansion perspective. And I think we\u2019ve realized about 300 basis points of margin expansion in the first half.  As we look into the second half, we don't have that same tailwind. Last year we had restructuring and most of those savings came in the second half of the year. And we realized that in the first half of the year. And I think we've also been very purposeful about how we phased our investments. So, we were purposely phasing those in the second half of the year. And some of those investments will start to ramp up a little bit in the second half. And then of course, inflation is just higher than what we had initially incorporated into our initial guide. And I think those are all the pieces.\nPatrick Decker: Yes, I think the only thing I would add Scott is that, I think, probably the most important thing is the read-through is how we see margins in our backlog. We are looking at very high backlogs here. The margin looks very encouraging, very sound, taking a consideration, pricing, the mix, et cetera. So, it sets up well for even more for 2022 and beyond. And as Sandy said, we are making some investments here in the second half as you would expect it to do. I mean, we always do, but we were purposeful in how we phase those into our outlook.\nScott Graham: Patrick, do you mean that the margins in the \u2013 first of all, Sandy, thank you for that clarity. That was great. Patrick, do you mean margins in the backlog are up versus the first half gross margin?\nPatrick Decker: What I'm saying is margins will continue to continue to be accretive coming to the backlog.\nScott Graham: Got it. Thank you.\nPatrick Decker: Thank you. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Buscaglia with Berenberg.\nAndrew Buscaglia: Good morning guys.\nSandy Rowland: Good morning.\nAndrew Buscaglia: End of last year you guys were talking things seemed pretty positive around some movement in emerging markets. And things sound like they are going okay so far, year-to-date. But I wonder, you mentioned some site access issues broadly, and some other \u2013 some of your peers are experiencing similar things. So, what about some of these countries that are maybe less vaccinated, do you think puts a pause in what you're seeing? Do you think there might just be a lag there before we start to see some of that?\nPatrick Decker: Sure, yes. So, I mean, you're absolute, right. We are a very global business. And so, we monitor this whole issue of not just the most recent variant, but the pandemic overall very closely. And we've not seen any meaningful change in customer demand. As a result of that obviously, we continue to take all precautions to keep our own people safe, to respect our customers\u2019 protocols. And I'm very, very proud of the work that the team has done from the very get-go. I mean, first quarter of last year, we saw first in China and it's hard to believe now, we\u2019re year and a half on. But our teams are very disciplined around this. Really, I mean, despite the sharp deceleration in India in the quarter because of the Delta variant there, we still saw very strong growth in emerging markets collectively. China, most notably, but Eastern Europe and others are performing extremely well. So, we're keeping a close eye, but again really haven't seen any meaningful impact as of now on the Delta variant.\nAndrew Buscaglia: Yes. Interesting. Okay. And then just probably it's been an active year for M&A. I'm just wondering what's the latest with you guys on that front? It definitely seems like you're in a strong position to make a move if you'd like to. So, any sort of update there would be great?\nPatrick Decker: Yes. So, again, the pipeline is very active and attractive pipeline. And again, it's a combination if we \u2013 I always bring it back to what are we solving for with M&A. And so, we look at it first by end markets in terms of what we're trying to build out in our offerings for customers. And then I look at it and we look at it from a technology and kind of application standpoint. I\u2019d say on the utility side we will continue. Certainly, second half of this year and onward, we will continue to look at and do bolt-ons and tuck-ins from a technology standpoint around, out that utility offering and feel very encouraged by what we see in the pipeline there you know. We talked a lot in the past about industrial. And certainly, that continues to be something we were very interested in and we've got an active pipeline there. As I always say, it takes two to tango. And so, we can't control the timing of when these things happen, but we continue to cultivate those opportunities. And then there are other verticals, I mean in commercial and resi lag that we certainly keep on our radar screen a look at. So, we feel good about the pipeline. And you will see some things there that we'll continue to do on the bolt on front, and we'll continue to cultivate some of the larger opportunities here over time. We're going to continue to remain disciplined on valuation. As I mentioned earlier to one of the other questions, we certainly are open to using our stock as a currency where it makes sense. So that will not be a disabler, it's an enabler when and if that makes sense to do.\nAndrew Buscaglia: Got it. Thank you.\nPatrick Decker: Thanks Andrew.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Joe Giordano with Cowen.\nJoe Giordano: Hey guys, good morning.\nPatrick Decker: Hey Joe good morning.\nSandy Rowland: Good morning Joe.\nJoe Giordano: So now it's one question, huh? Okay. All right. Yes, so just like with Delta, and, of course, you touched on this earlier, but are you hearing just on the margin, you said orders are kind of getting released because of site access, opening back up. How you like doing the risk internally of that being walked back by your customers a little bit with like actually in requirements, having that issue and like?\nPatrick Decker: Yes. No, it's definitely something Joe. I mean, my comment, when I say, we're monitoring closely, we'd rather this far, we've not seen meaningful impact. You're absolutely right, to remind all of us and we certainly are on top of it that we don't take this for granted. And I think again we do build contingency plans into our thinking here as a leadership team. Unfortunately, we've had too much experience in dealing with this over the course of the last year and a half. And weathered it well. But we just, all I'm saying is we haven't seen it yet at this point in time. And obviously we are we are being very vigilant. We are encouraging vaccinations within our own team, we are doing the face masking, we continue to maintain all necessary safety protocols within our own operations. And again, very much respecting the wishes of our customers. I would say that one of the, and you've probably heard this elsewhere, Joe is, at least from a deal flow standpoint, I think, we've all kind of learned how to negotiate these projects and do these deals without being in front of each other all the time. I don't think that's going to change dramatically. To your point it really is. But when the deal actually has to get executed and something gets implemented and installed, yes, we keep our eyes wide open for that. But again, we've not seen any impact on that certainly as of now,\nJoe Giordano: Thanks.\nPatrick Decker: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Jake Levinson with Melius Research.\nJake Levinson: Good morning, everyone.\nPatrick Decker: Good morning, Jake. \nJake Levinson: Just had \u2013 well, I mean, I think, it's pretty unusual that we're talking about having your working capital improve at these levels in the middle of an upcycle. So maybe you can parse for us what's really driving that certainly not the first quarter we're saying that. But is it lean manufacturing, is it restructuring, is it the supply chain initiatives really just any color you can provide there would be helpful?\nSandy Rowland: Yes. Thanks for the question. I think the team is doing really good work, keeping their eye on the ball of working capital. And that's one of our key KPIs that we monitor very closely throughout the year. And I think it's really, it's all aspects of working capital. So, our credit and collections team, is doing a really good job driving down the past due. So, we're seeing good results there. On the inventory front, we'd actually like to carry a little bit more inventory right now to manage through some of the supply chain challenges. And we had actually built into our plan building up a little more inventory. But the reality is as soon as we are getting that in, it's going back out the door to meet demand, which is a good thing. And we have an active supply chain financing program that helps us take advantage of our strong credit ratings. And we're seeing good adoption with some of our suppliers onboarding into that program. And that's giving us some benefits. So, it's really across the board. And we're going to continue to drive it through the rest of the year.\nJake Levinson: Thanks, Sandy. I appreciate the color. And I'll pass it on.\nPatrick Decker: Thanks, Jake.\nOperator: [Indiscernible] Andrew your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Yes. Hi, good afternoon. I think it's the afternoon now. How are you guys?\nPatrick Decker: [Indiscernible]\nUnidentified Analyst: Can you give us more color into your applied water business? I think it is your only segment in terms of revenue that's now decently above pre-pandemic levels, at least on a quarterly basis. I know residential smaller than commercial residential seems to be driving quite a bit of strength. So how sustainable is that? And then in commercial, it does seem like your commentary regarding commercial recovery, especially in the U.S. has changed significantly for the positive. So, what are you seeing there?\nPatrick Decker: Sure. So, I'll \u2013 let me take the first piece, and then I may ask you to repeat the second part of your question. On applied water, I would remind everybody that it is predominantly a GDP kind of business. I mean, we're confident that we can outperform that and grow faster than GDP. But what we're seeing right now is obviously a fair amount of reopening activity. And so, some catch up there. Obviously, it's a short cycle business. So, as we've gone out with successive price increases there has been some pool in buying there, no doubt. But we do feel good about the momentum. I would say also one of the things that we're very pleased about there is the team has made an increasing number of investments in new product development in that business to refresh some product lines. And so, we're seeing the impact and success of that and we're going to continue to make those investments really focused on things like energy efficiency as one example. But again, I think that it's a similar rebound right now that we're seeing from previous downturns, on a global scale. So, feel good about it, I think, it's sustainable. But again, that really would explain to here in the immediate term what that stronger demand is. And again, we expect that to continue through the second half of this year and into 2022.\nUnidentified Analyst: Yes, Patrick, I was just \u2013 the second part of the question was around commercial specifically. I mean, it does seem like your commentary has turned more positive here. Obviously, we're all worried about the virus. But anything specifically that's changed in your business over the last quarter or two?\nPatrick Decker: Yes, that's okay. Thank you. So, if I took them at first in the U.S. our replacement business, which is our book and ship, is very solid there. And we do expect new commercial building to be a bit soft through 2021. So that's not really driving our growth here, it really is a replacement piece. You may have heard us say before, when we talk about commercial, we talk about the institutional sector of commercial, not so much kind of the pure non-res. And that outlook actually is improving. And we think that will further improve just based upon some of the discussions like infrastructure spend, et cetera. We've also seen a healthy activity in Europe where we had double digit growth in the first quarter. That's come from some modest share games as well as we believe the resilience of our supply chain versus some of our peers. And again, really focusing on new product launches it's tied to things like smart drives, again, eco-friendly products being launched, the whole energy efficiency play that we're trying to get ahead of in terms of impending regulations that are coming forward.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thanks, Patrick. \nPatrick Decker: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James.\nPavel Molchanov: Thanks for taking the question. Just one will be about software in your M&C business. Can you give an update on what the demand picture looks like in terms of digitization, virtualization from the utility sector of vis-\u00e0-vis software solutions?\nPatrick Decker: Yes, certainly, and we'll talk more about this at Investor Day with real hard specifics and numbers around that to dimensionalize kind of where we see the conversion kind of pace being within the utilities specifically. But we are encouraged by the adoption there. And that is not only a U.S. phenomenon, we're seeing that in Europe in the emerging markets as well. And it really is \u2013 I think what we see it's tied to most importantly is around affordability. So, as our utility customers are looking to deal with these challenges in front of them around again, scarcity, water equity, building resilient infrastructure, it always comes down to how they're going to pay for it. And that's where we're really getting most traction right now is whether it be around reducing the initial capital outlay because of smarter infrastructure, whether it be reducing things like water losses which is immediate revenue generation for them. Those are the areas that we're seeing most traction right now in that dialogue. And we're seeing some of those pilots that we we've been talking about the last year or more really converting now into sustainable revenues. So absolutely interest, absolutely adoption wish it was even faster. We'll have more to talk about that in the Investor Day.\nPavel Molchanov: Thank you very much.\nPatrick Decker: Thank you.\nOperator: At this time there are no further questions. I would like to turn the floor to Mr. Decker for any additional or closing remarks.\nPatrick Decker: Well, thank you. Again, thanks for all of you for your continued interest. We look forward to our Investor Day on September 30. Again, as I mentioned, Matt and the team will be getting the details logistically out to you very shortly. Meanwhile, stay safe, stay well. And we wish you all the very best. Talk to you soon.\nOperator: Thank you for participating in today's conference. Your may now disconnect your lines at this time.",

            "content": "Thank you, Patrick. The second quarter offered a strong story of continuing demand recovery as revenue grew 11% organically compared to the prior year. We also saw momentum across most end markets on a quarter sequential basis. Utilities, our largest end market, was up 6% compared to the prior year, driven by clean water applications and continued wastewater utility OpEx demand. Industrial was up 17% on broad-based strengths as economies reopened and activity continued to ramp. Commercial grew 12% and also improved sequentially led by strength in the U.S. and Western Europe, while residential, our smallest end market grew 29%. Geographically, Western Europe and China were both up mid-teens with increasing demand seen across all end markets. The U.S. returned to growth with site access restrictions easing during the quarter. As Patrick mentioned, the team delivered exceptional organic orders growth of 29% on strong underlying demand across all segments and regions, with particular pace in M&CS, which grew orders 70% on large water metrology contracts. This is our fourth consecutive quarter of sequential orders improvements and it reflects higher orders growth than in the same period in 2019. Importantly, we exit the quarter with overall backlog ups 35%. Looking at the key financial metrics, margins were above our forecasted range with EBITDA margin coming in at 17.3%. The 200 basis points of year-over-year EBITDA margin expansion came largely from productivity volume and favorable mix, partially offset by inflation and investments. Earnings per share in the quarter was $0.66, which is up 65%. Please turn to Slide 5 and I'll review our segment performance for the quarter. Water Infrastructure delivered strong results during the quarter. Orders were flat, but up 22% excluding the large prior year deal in Telangana, India. Order intake was robust in treatment globally. Revenues were up 6% organically. Wastewater utilities remained resilient and we are now seeing recovery in the industrial end market. Geographically, emerging markets delivered mid-teens growth from industrial recovery driven in part by increasing mining demand in Latin America and Africa, while Western Europe delivered double digit girls from continued strong utility OpEx activities. In the U.S. healthy utilities OpEx demand reflected in strong orders growth, was offset by the lapping of prior year treatment project deliveries. EBITDA margin was in line with the prior year as strong productivity savings and volume effects, offset inflation and investments. Now please turn to Slide 6. The applied water segment had a very strong quarter driven by continuing market recovery across all regions and end markets. Orders were up 43%, organically in the quarter with particular strength in the U.S. and Western Europe. Revenue grew 18% in the quarter with double digit industrial demand driven by reopening activity, and especially in marine and food and beverage applications. Residential growth continues to be robust on strong market demand. Geographically, the U.S. was up double digits while yet Western Europe contributed 27% growth on increasing industrial demand. Emerging markets were up 24% due in part to broad industrial recovery and momentum in China. Segment EBITDA margin grew 200 basis points compared to the prior year. The expansion came from strong volume, leverage and productivity, more than offsetting material and freight inflation. Now please turn to Slide 7, and I'll cover our Measurement & Control Solutions segment. M&CS deliver a strong quarter as large project deployments began to ramp. We also realized gains in our industrial water quality testing business. Orders for the segment were up 70% organically on strong demand. Our M&CS backlog now stands at $1.5 billion, which is an historic high and almost 50% higher than at this time last year. We have secured more than $400 million in large contracts in the last 18 months. That reflects a number of major projects, which increasingly include our blotter digital solutions in combination with our core metrology application. Revenue was up 11% led by 17% growth in water applications, driven by large project deployments and double-digit growth in water quality applications. Energy applications were down modestly due to project timing and supply chain constraints. Unpacking the results by geography, emerging markets in Western Europe were up 20% and 25% respectively. The U.S. was up mid-single digits on strong demand for water quality applications and assessment services. As a reminder, for this segment in particular, growth rates can be uneven due to the impact of project timing. Segment EBITDA margin in the quarter was up 460 basis points compared to the prior year. Strong productivity savings from prior year restructuring actions, favorable mix and volume leverage more than offset inflation in investments. Now let's turn to Slide 8 for an overview of cash flows and the company's financial position. Our balance sheet continues to be very strong. We closed the quarter with $1.8 billion in cash and cash equivalents. In the third quarter, $600 million of senior notes will mature to be paid with cash. Free cash flow conversion was 172% in the quarter in line with our expectations and historical seasonality patterns. Net debt to EBITDA leverage was 1.3 times at the end of the quarter. Pease turn to Slide 9 and I'll turn the call back over to Patrick. Thanks, Patrick. Our full-year outlook for our end markets remains largely consistent with our view from last quarter with some positive evolution as a few end markets are showing even faster recovery. In utilities, demand continues to be strong in both wastewater and clean water, affirming our anticipated growth of mid-to-high single digits. On the wastewater side, we have seen steady demand in Western Europe and North America as operators continue to focus on mission-critical applications while also investing in larger scale upgrades on affordable funding from capital markets. Bid activity and long-term capital spending outlook in emerging markets remains solid, though some COVID concerns linger in certain markets. On the clean water side, demand for smart water solutions and digital offerings continues to be robust as utilities increasingly turn their focus to more resilient infrastructure and affordable water delivery. Consistent with other technology companies, the connected nature of our solutions raises some risk in the second half, given prolonged supply chain constraints for electronic components. Our teams are working closely with our suppliers and manufacturing partners to optimize deliveries. Please turn to Slide 11. Looking at the industrial end market, where we had expected mid-single digits growth for the year, we are now anticipated growing in the high single digits. The growth is broad-based with rebounding industrial activity across all segments and regions. We're seeing upticks in demand, particularly in our industrial dewatering business in emerging markets. We're also seeing higher demand in marine and food and beverage, driven by recovery in outdoor recreation and the hospitality sector. We are increasing our outlook in the commercial end market as well. The U.S. replacement business is growing at a first pace. New commercial building is expected to lag the recovery somewhat, but key leading indicators reflect optimism for late 2021 recovery in the institutional sector. With growth in Western Europe and China sustained through the second half, along with modest share gains and supply chain resiliency, we now expect the commercial end market to be up mid-to-high single digits, up from the low single digits previously. In residential, we now anticipate low teens growth for the full year, up modestly from our previous expectations of high single-digit to low double-digit growth. We do expect growth will moderate through the second half, due largely to a more difficult year-over-year comparisons. And now let's turn to Slide 12, and I'll walk you through our updated guidance. As you can see, we are further raising our previous annual guidance. For Xylem overall, we now see full year organic revenue growth in the range of 6% to 8%, up from our previous guidance range of 5% to 7%. This confidence is based on clear demand recovery, combined with the pricing actions we are taking to offset inflation. This revenue guidance breaks down by segment as follows. For water infrastructure, we expect mid-single-digit growth from a previous expectation of mid-to-high single digits. We expect low double-digit growth in applied water, up from mid-to-high single digits. And in measurement & control solutions, we expect mid-single-digit growth. We also expect EBITDA margins in the range of 17.2% to 17.7%. This guidance represents full-year margin expansion of 120 basis points at the midpoint. That's grounded in a strong first-half performance with 300 basis points of expansion from restructuring savings on actions we took late last year, as well as volume leverage from the top line growth. The third quarter is more challenging, primarily driven by the timing of inflation and price realization. However, price realization will increase into the fourth quarter as we work through the large backlog built over the last several quarters. Overall, we expect strong second-half margins compared to the first half of the year. This yields an adjusted EPS guidance range of $2.55 to $2.70, reflecting increased confidence in our ability to lift the bottom end of the range while still managing through inflation and supply chain challenges. That range now reflects a 28% increase in EPS guidance at the midpoint over last year. We continue to expect full-year 2021 free cash flow conversion of 80% to 90% as previously guided, putting our three-year average right around 130%. We have provided you with a number of other full-year assumptions to supplement your models. Those assumptions are largely unchanged from our original guidance. However, one item worth noting is our updated assumption on foreign exchange for the second half of the year. Because of the recent dip in the euro and the disproportionate effect it had on our results, we've updated our euro to dollar conversion rate assumption for the second half from 1.22 to 1.18. This change, along with some other currency movements has a $0.04 negative impact on our second-half outlook. As you know, foreign exchange can be volatile, so we've included our typical foreign exchange sensitivity table in the appendix. Also, we are making an adjustment to our restructuring and realignment guidance from 50 million to 60 million to now 30 million to 40 million, while still expecting to realize similar restructuring savings due to high natural attrition and the timing of actions. And now before wrapping up, let me share some thoughts on our third-quarter outlook. We anticipate total company organic revenues will grow in the range of 5% to 7%. This includes mid-single-digit growth in water infrastructure, high single-digit growth in applied water, and low single-digit growth in M&CS. We expect third-quarter adjusted-EBITDA margin to be in the range of 16.7% to 17.2%, largely in line with our strong second quarter. While inflation and component supply are likely to present some headwinds in the third quarter, we are addressing them with the pricing and supply chain actions previously mentioned. And with that, please turn to Slide 13, and I'll turn the call back over to Patrick for some closing comments. Hi, Mike. Good morning, Deane. Yes. Thanks for the question, Deane. I think that we're very happy with how we've managed through the inflation dynamics through the first half of the year. And we were able to realize some incremental price in Q2. We do expect that, that will continue to ramp throughout the year. Just as a reminder, we're now up on our third price increase for the year. We got out of the gate early with a price increase in the first quarter because of the continuous rise in the commodity prices. We've then taken that decision to take two additional price increases. I think there is one unique dynamic that we're working through. The backlogs are a little higher than we typically find at any given period of time. And so the realizations, there's a little bit of a timing issue. But net-net, I think we're doing a good job here, and it will continue to ramp, particularly in the fourth quarter. Yes. I think it's a modest shift. I think we did take the water infrastructure guide up in the first \u2013 at the end of the first quarter, we initially guided to about a 4% increase. We took that up. I think we're very close in the same spot. It's largely unchanged. No. Go ahead, Ryan. Yes. Thanks for the question. I think, first of all, we are seeing great momentum on the orders front. And so we do believe that demand is coming back in a very sustainable way. I think if you break it down a little bit by our segments, I think in water infrastructure, in particular, we're probably seeing the most natural order flow and not really an acceleration or deviation from historical timing. When you shift over and look at AWS and M&CS where I think we're up 43% in AWS in the quarter and 70% in M&CS, there is true demand returning. But we are seeing customers try to get in line a little bit, whether it's ahead of longer lead times that we published, some incremental pricing actions that we've announced, or importantly, the supply chain components that we've talked about extensively on the call. All of that in combination is certainly impacting some of the buying behaviors. But I think the order momentum that we have is \u2013 we're really excited about, and we think it positions us well not only for the second half of the year, but as we look forward into 2022 and beyond. I think it's minor. We try to tighten the range a little bit as we move into the second half, but we did have some U.S. treatment orders that just got pushed out a little bit in \u2013 that we had in Q2 that have gotten pushed out, and some of that plays through the rest of the guide. But I think fundamentally, we're seeing good orders momentum in treatment. We're seeing good orders momentum in dewatering, and transport is \u2013 continues to be strong. So there's nothing there from an order perspective that gives us any concern. And I view it just as we're tightening the range a little bit as we move into the second half. So I think great question, Nate. I think you've got the flow well understood. The first step for us is to bring something into our backlog. And we tend to see that around large metrology deployments. And as we get closer to the rollout phase, we start to see real orders that come in from our customers. And I think we're seeing a pop in the order rate because some of the large orders, large awards that we brought into backlog are starting to convert into orders now that some of the site access restrictions are easing. And some of it also is what I just answered before. We are seeing that some of the customers are trying to get in line sooner to get in front of some of the component shortages. But I think backlog is a leading indicator and the orders means that it's starting to \u2013 will start to convert into revenue in a more short-term basis. Good morning Scott. Yes, it's about 50 basis points in the quarter. In water infrastructure it's flattish. And then we did see that the greatest price realization within AWS, and that's where we're seeing some more of the commodity increases hit most rapidly. And we did see a little bit of pricing benefit in M&CS, which is tied into our contract terms with our customer. I think what's important to note is that we're going to see \u2013 we do expect incremental pricing benefits as we move through the year, and you're going to see that number rise in each of our upcoming calls. Yes. I think one thing is important to recognize if you look at water infrastructure, if you look at it quarter sequentially, we did see an uptick in margins as we move from the first quarter to the second quarter. And we think that they were well positioned on that front. Yes. So, I think if you look first half, second half, we expect higher margins in the second half of the year. If we look Q2 to Q3, those two quarters actually are shaping up to look very similar. They're about the same size from a revenue perspective. And our guide is very close to what we realized in Q3. And then we do expect it uptick in margins in the fourth quarter. But not as much year-over-year improvement in the second half. And I think that's very consistent with our guide for the year. We expect it to come out of the gate strong from a margin expansion perspective. And I think we've realized about 300 basis points of margin expansion in the first half.  As we look into the second half, we don't have that same tailwind. Last year we had restructuring and most of those savings came in the second half of the year. And we realized that in the first half of the year. And I think we've also been very purposeful about how we phased our investments. So, we were purposely phasing those in the second half of the year. And some of those investments will start to ramp up a little bit in the second half. And then of course, inflation is just higher than what we had initially incorporated into our initial guide. And I think those are all the pieces. Good morning. Good morning Joe. Yes. Thanks for the question. I think the team is doing really good work, keeping their eye on the ball of working capital. And that's one of our key KPIs that we monitor very closely throughout the year. And I think it's really, it's all aspects of working capital. So, our credit and collections team, is doing a really good job driving down the past due. So, we're seeing good results there. On the inventory front, we'd actually like to carry a little bit more inventory right now to manage through some of the supply chain challenges. And we had actually built into our plan building up a little more inventory. But the reality is as soon as we are getting that in, it's going back out the door to meet demand, which is a good thing. And we have an active supply chain financing program that helps us take advantage of our strong credit ratings. And we're seeing good adoption with some of our suppliers onboarding into that program. And that's giving us some benefits. So, it's really across the board. And we're going to continue to drive it through the rest of the year."

            "name": "Patrick Decker",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. The call is starting a bit later in the morning than usual this quarter. So, by now, you will have seen that second quarter performance exceeded our expectations on all major metrics, including orders, revenue, margin, and earnings per share. I'm very proud of the team beating the healthy pace we set in the first quarter and just delivering a very strong first half of the year. Underlying demand for our solutions was robust across all segments and end-markets. The team did a great job converting that into better-than-expected performance and continuing to expand margin. They delivered even more exceptional results on orders, which grew 29% on underlying demand across all regions. In addition, backlog is up 35% versus this point last year, that broad expansion reflects commercial momentum that puts us in a strong position both now and into the future, as we continue to invest in sustainable growth. At the end of the first quarter, we raised full year guidance on revenue and earnings. The second quarter's performance shows a continuing strong trajectory into the second half. And we are reflecting that by further raising full year revenue guidance. The topline benefits are likely to be moderated somewhat by inflation and a challenging supply chain environment. But we've been proactive on price and are working with our supply chain partners to mitigate the impact of those headwinds. So, we are also raising the midpoint on earnings per share guidance for the full year. In a moment I'll provide some additional color on what we're seeing globally. But first, let me hand it over to Sandy to provide more detail on performance in the quarter. Thanks Sandy. I want to touch on three areas briefly. Our operating discipline, our growth platforms and sustainability. On operating discipline, the team did an excellent job on margins in the quarter, delivering 200 basis points of EBITDA margin expansion year-on-year, in addition to quarter sequential improvement. We do anticipate some inflation and component supply challenges in the second half, but we're confident in our ability to manage through them and to mitigate their impact. Earlier, I noted our extremely healthy backlogs. As we've worked through these volumes, the team is doing a great job, making sure we manage the pressure on working capital this can create. In fact, despite serving spiking demand, we've improved working capital both year-over-year and quarter sequentially. As Sandy just mentioned, that performance puts us firmly on track to deliver our commitment on attractive free cash flow conversion. We clearly have significant capacity for capital deployment. On top of strong organic growth investment options, we have an attractive and active pipeline of M&A opportunities. Our growth platforms are an area we'll be delving into at our Investor Day in September, so I'm going to refrain from too much detail here today. I do want to draw attention to two things, however. Last quarter, we highlighted the pace of growth in emerging markets. This quarter, that pace has continued. Despite India's hard acceleration through the quarter due to COVID impact there. I'm very proud of the entire Xylem team's discipline and compassionate response in all countries affected by COVID, both in terms of our own operations and also how we've leaned in to support customers and help serve our communities. I also want to take a moment to draw a connecting line between our portfolio and some of the dramatic water-centric events we've been seeing recently around the world, by which I mean the flooding in Europe, China, and Central Asia and the drought in American West. These events reflect a trend as the effects of climate change become more and more apparent. And that trend requires an affordable response to keep communities safe, resilient, and water secure. So we continue to invest in specific technologies in our portfolio that respond to these challenges. As an example, automated wastewater network optimization is amongst our most advanced digital solutions. Its job is to manage overflows and prevent flooding. And our customer deployments are already preventing 1.4 billion cubic meters of water from flooding communities. Similarly, we also continue to innovate in the technologies that make communities more resilient to drought, technologies like leak detection, smart metering and especially water reuse. Already 1 trillion gallons of water are being recycled using Xylem technology, which brings me to the topic of sustainability more broadly. The numbers I just quoted come from our annual-sustainability report, which we published in June. And I think they bear out what we've said for some time. Our sustainability strategy is fundamental to our business strategy. We were pleased to report, for example, that almost half of our major facilities are now operating on 100% renewable energy, helping reduce our greenhouse gas emissions intensity by more than 7% year-over-year. Beyond our own footprint, our solutions have enabled our customers to reduce their carbon emissions by 700,000 metric tons last year. The report details progress on all of our signature sustainability goals and shows how sustainability is deeply embedded in who we are as a company. Now with that, I'll hand it back over to Sandy to provide commentary on our end markets and guidance for the remainder of the year. Thanks, Sandy. The team has been doing an outstanding job capturing market demand, giving us exceptional orders and backlog growth. We expect to continue capitalizing on that underlying demand. And the team will manage through the near-term supply chain environment with the same spirit and discipline they've demonstrated through the many external challenges of the past year. Looking forward, trends toward new investment in infrastructure and particularly in the modernization of infrastructure are accelerating hand-in-hand with demand to make communities more resilient to climate change and to do it in a more affordable way. Those trends only reinforce the strength of our investment thesis, that our differentiated portfolio of leading technologies, addressing scarcity, resilience, and affordability will drive increased revenue growth and margins, and sustainable growth with strong cash flow generation and increased opportunity for capital deployment. This puts us in a privileged position to create both economic and social value for our stakeholders now and over the medium and long term. We are genuinely excited about providing an update on our strategy and long-term plans at our upcoming Investor Day, which is scheduled for September 30. It will be the first opportunity for many of you to meet all of our business leaders and our entire senior leadership team, especially those who joined us over the past year. So it's a great chance to provide a full-strategic update, including our long-term financial targets, and a deep dive into our vision of how digital solutions are transforming outcomes for our customers, including discussions with a few of those customers who've deployed some of our most advanced technologies. Matt and the team will follow up with invitations and logistical details in the coming days. Now let's turn the call over to you and are happy to take any questions you may have. So operator? Hey, Mike. How are you doing? Yes, sure. Thanks, Mike. Great question. So yes, the backlog growth in M&CS specifically was about 49% in this past quarter. So a really good uptick. Really encouraged by a number of not just the large-deal wins that the team has achieved there, but also the base business, the day-to-day business grew quite nicely in the quarter, and we see good momentum there. We feel that the site access issues have certainly eased. I wouldn't say they're completely resolved, but they're certainly trending in the right direction. Where we're really seeing \u2013 and really, the primary challenge out there right now, which the team is all over working hard to mitigate that is some of the component shortages. And that's not limited to us. That really is not just across our sector, but as you all well know, broader sectors as well. But the team is all over. We're doing everything we can, whether it be kind of paying up for some components, making sure we lock in commitments around that. So we're very \u2013 we feel very good about the momentum. It really does feel like that part of our business is turning the corner in terms of converting things into backlog. We look at the margin in backlog, especially as we go into 2022 and feel very good about that, not just what they've achieved already this year. Again, challenges aside in the second half around component shortages, and those are real. They're not insignificant, but we're confident we can work through that. And it's shaping up very nice for 2022 and beyond. Sure. Yes. And I think on the \u2013 let me take the second one first. The margin on the backlog, we're confident about as we go into 2022 and beyond. Again, we've got this near-term challenge we're working through in Q3 and Q4 on component shortages, et cetera. But again, we're holding our own there. As it relates to the mix, we continue to see a real adoption of \u2013 even in these large metrology deals that we're doing, there is an ever-going increased component of that, that is digital. And so we're very encouraged by that. And we continue to see a number of really impressive wins on the branding that we call Xylem Vue, which is the purely digital kind of data-driven diagnostic capabilities. And so we're very encouraged in that area as well. But there's definitely a shifting mix toward the digital component. We'll have more that we'll share on that at our upcoming Investor Day to kind of unpack and unbundle that for you all. Thank you. Good morning, Deane. How are you doing? Yes. And Deane, I would just offer that, so yes, as Sandy said, the most challenging time frame we say right now is really in Q3 because we did have this big bump in backlog. And so that's \u2013 we're shipping that out. We \u2013 there is price realization in there. But as you know, commodities especially have moved so quickly that we've gone out now and we'll go out again with further price increases. But we \u2013 as we look at the exit, especially in Q4, that really all comes back into complete equilibrium. And we are net positive at that point once again. Yes. No, absolutely. And I think, Deane \u2013 I'll give you an answer. And Deane, I think this is absolutely what we want to delve in a bit more at Investor Day. We really kind of want to lay out that baseline and that framework as to how we think about digital and what that kind of trend line is and what our metrics and incentives tied to that are. So much more to come at Investor Day. But just to put it in perspective, we've had, in the last 18 months, we've had $400 million roughly in large-deal wins. And that has had a significant digital component to it. And so that just gives you one sense of kind of proof point. And then there are a number of, again, really interesting projects and deals that we've won with what we call the Xylem Vue, which is, again, purely the diagnostic kind of consultative side of the business that we'll be highlighting at Investor Day. So we'll cover more of that on September 30. But hopefully, that gives you a bit of a flavor of that. There's a real meaningful adoption here on the digital side that we want to give the appropriate color to. We're very, very excited about it. Yes. I think there's some timing of project delivery and some shipments. We had some pretty impressive comps versus last year. Deane, I wouldn't read anything into that. I mean, we're trying to be prudent just in terms of the guide for the second half. But there's nothing happening from a market standpoint that is changing our view on that segment. We're very confident. It continues to be very much in that healthy mid-single-digit kind of growth rate as we'd expect. And there, that also cuts across geographies, Deane. We're not seeing any kind of slowdown or shift in spending in the U.S. because of infrastructure discussion or any of that is just \u2013 again, it's trying to be prudent. Thank you. No, that's fair, Ryan. I mean, again, I'd be remiss if I didn't give a huge shout out to the team that's working through this because it is challenging. I mean it's not an insignificant challenge that they're trying to overcome at this point in time. But just to put some kind of parameters around this. And we estimate right now, we've probably moved roughly at least $20 million of revenue out of the second half of the year into 2022. Obviously, there's never any guarantee. Obviously, that comes with healthy margins. And so if it weren't for that, we would probably be talking about a further adjustment to our guide. But that's the reality that we are working through at this point in time. And it's not without risk. So our teams are working their backsides off in that regard. Yes, we don't feel that we are losing revenue from a competitive standpoint because we're all facing the same challenges. And this is a pretty sticky business. It's hard to swap out suppliers. So that's the right characterization, Ryan. Hopefully, a little bit extra color can be was helpful. Yes. No, you're absolutely right, Ryan. I mean we \u2013 the teams are continuing to remain primarily focused on pricing for value. And that, again, really tying back to, again, what are the customer outcomes that we're looking to achieve here in terms of helping them achieve their goals. And so we are getting better, I think, at pricing for value. I would say in these kinds of interesting environments, we were not really doing surcharges. So it's not like we're putting it out there where we have to dial it back later. And so we're trying to be disciplined in that regard. At the same time, we also dealt with this. It wasn't that long ago, we were talking about the tariffs and all the other interesting pricing challenges that we had to overcome. So again, I don't want to minimize the incredible hard work the teams are doing to deal with this pricing environment. But I'm very pleased and very proud of what they've accomplished thus far. Two-question restrictions, Ryan. Absolutely, Ryan. I mean, it's a great point. But if I bring it back to center on that theme around kind of capital deployment, again, the pipeline is very active. It's \u2013 we believe there are things that are actionable there of different shapes and sizes. We absolutely would believe in using our currency in the right way and leverage that in the right way to go after really attractive strategic assets that are a good strategic fit. Obviously, we still are going to be disciplined around returns and it really is around growth, making sure it's accretive, making sure margins are accretive. There's a technology component, we believe it's very important that there is a services recurring revenue component that are very attractive. So those fundamentals don't change. But your question around using stock as a currency, that is something that we are very much open to in a disciplined way. And I like the point you made. I do believe that \u2013 and again, I'm very proud of what the entire team has done here on making sure that sustainability for us and the broader ESG is not just some kind of stand-alone thing. It's deeply integrated into our business. It's what we do as a company. And it's in our operating processes. We have incentives tied around it. And I do think that, that is an area of synergy as we look at other companies that we could bring into the portfolio. So I think a very good point in your part, Ryan. Sure. Thank you. Hey, good morning, Nate. And I would add, Nate, it's not too much specifically in a reaction to your question on the order flow and so forth. But we didn't call out earlier. And I really do want to get a shout out to our team within M&CS that manages our analytics business. I mean they've been performing very well. It's really high margin, and that business really has been showing robust growth and strength. So that's \u2013 it doesn't move the numbers dramatically in the aggregate, but it's very rich in margin. And I'm very proud of what the team is doing there. Yes, Nate. It's again, another great question. I would say labor shortage, managing attrition, it is a challenge. It is a headache. It's something that I and management team worry about a lot. But it's not our primary challenge. I mean I think our primary challenge right now is, again, working through the component shortages and the supply chain challenges, which, in some cases, is an indirect impact of labor shortage, broadly speaking. I would say one of the areas also that we are very focused on is retaining some critical areas like software engineers, a very competitive landscape at this point in time. I mean we are focused on it. We feel that our \u2013 not only our purpose and mission as a company is very compelling for attracting and retaining a wide variety of talent. But two, we are continuing to look at some flexible areas that we can just drive further retention. Obviously, the pandemic has been hard on everyone around the world, and there is some dislocation occurring right now. And so we're being very thoughtful as to how we work through that. We built any of that incremental cost into our outlook, but that's something that we are going to continue to stay very close to because the talent is just so, it's so essential here in terms of what we're trying to accomplish. Thank you. Hey Scott. Yes, so, the other thing I'd add Scott is just and I think Sandy touched on this in her response to you was, we saw commodity inflation has not hit us equally or consistently in each aspect of our business. It really is a different issue of mix. And so obviously our pricing is driven by our views on not only selling value, but dealing with commodity inflation. So, we just saw more of that earlier on given the shorter cycle nature of our Applied Water business and because of some of the component shortages and other things in M&Cs. I'm not saying it was not an issue in water infrastructure. Our team would not be happy hearing me say otherwise they've dealt with it also. But it's just the timing of when those commodity inflation impacts would hit us. But we felt good about the run rate within each of the segments. That's right. So, Scott, we have \u2013 we did see watering return to growth, which was great to see. It was more in the sale of pumps into our channels than it was about the rental side, which would have driven higher incremental margin for us with just how rich that rental side is. So, it was really just a little bit of the mix of where we were seeing the return, particularly in the industrial side, you saw it in the emerging markets and you saw in some of the areas where we serve the mining sector. And it was a lot of pump sales as opposed to the rental, but we have seen rental start to come back here. I think that's something that \u2013 that could be something we see in the second half, particularly in North America as the construction markets and other areas get going. Yes, I think the only thing I would add Scott is that, I think, probably the most important thing is the read-through is how we see margins in our backlog. We are looking at very high backlogs here. The margin looks very encouraging, very sound, taking a consideration, pricing, the mix, et cetera. So, it sets up well for even more for 2022 and beyond. And as Sandy said, we are making some investments here in the second half as you would expect it to do. I mean, we always do, but we were purposeful in how we phase those into our outlook. What I'm saying is margins will continue to continue to be accretive coming to the backlog. Thank you. Sure, yes. So, I mean, you're absolute, right. We are a very global business. And so, we monitor this whole issue of not just the most recent variant, but the pandemic overall very closely. And we've not seen any meaningful change in customer demand. As a result of that obviously, we continue to take all precautions to keep our own people safe, to respect our customers' protocols. And I'm very, very proud of the work that the team has done from the very get-go. I mean, first quarter of last year, we saw first in China and it's hard to believe now, we're year and a half on. But our teams are very disciplined around this. Really, I mean, despite the sharp deceleration in India in the quarter because of the Delta variant there, we still saw very strong growth in emerging markets collectively. China, most notably, but Eastern Europe and others are performing extremely well. So, we're keeping a close eye, but again really haven't seen any meaningful impact as of now on the Delta variant. Yes. So, again, the pipeline is very active and attractive pipeline. And again, it's a combination if we \u2013 I always bring it back to what are we solving for with M&A. And so, we look at it first by end markets in terms of what we're trying to build out in our offerings for customers. And then I look at it and we look at it from a technology and kind of application standpoint. I'd say on the utility side we will continue. Certainly, second half of this year and onward, we will continue to look at and do bolt-ons and tuck-ins from a technology standpoint around, out that utility offering and feel very encouraged by what we see in the pipeline there you know. We talked a lot in the past about industrial. And certainly, that continues to be something we were very interested in and we've got an active pipeline there. As I always say, it takes two to tango. And so, we can't control the timing of when these things happen, but we continue to cultivate those opportunities. And then there are other verticals, I mean in commercial and resi lag that we certainly keep on our radar screen a look at. So, we feel good about the pipeline. And you will see some things there that we'll continue to do on the bolt on front, and we'll continue to cultivate some of the larger opportunities here over time. We're going to continue to remain disciplined on valuation. As I mentioned earlier to one of the other questions, we certainly are open to using our stock as a currency where it makes sense. So that will not be a disabler, it's an enabler when and if that makes sense to do. Thanks Andrew. Hey Joe good morning. Yes. No, it's definitely something Joe. I mean, my comment, when I say, we're monitoring closely, we'd rather this far, we've not seen meaningful impact. You're absolutely right, to remind all of us and we certainly are on top of it that we don't take this for granted. And I think again we do build contingency plans into our thinking here as a leadership team. Unfortunately, we've had too much experience in dealing with this over the course of the last year and a half. And weathered it well. But we just, all I'm saying is we haven't seen it yet at this point in time. And obviously we are we are being very vigilant. We are encouraging vaccinations within our own team, we are doing the face masking, we continue to maintain all necessary safety protocols within our own operations. And again, very much respecting the wishes of our customers. I would say that one of the, and you've probably heard this elsewhere, Joe is, at least from a deal flow standpoint, I think, we've all kind of learned how to negotiate these projects and do these deals without being in front of each other all the time. I don't think that's going to change dramatically. To your point it really is. But when the deal actually has to get executed and something gets implemented and installed, yes, we keep our eyes wide open for that. But again, we've not seen any impact on that certainly as of now, Thank you. Good morning, Jake. Thanks, Jake. [Indiscernible] Sure. So, I'll \u2013 let me take the first piece, and then I may ask you to repeat the second part of your question. On applied water, I would remind everybody that it is predominantly a GDP kind of business. I mean, we're confident that we can outperform that and grow faster than GDP. But what we're seeing right now is obviously a fair amount of reopening activity. And so, some catch up there. Obviously, it's a short cycle business. So, as we've gone out with successive price increases there has been some pool in buying there, no doubt. But we do feel good about the momentum. I would say also one of the things that we're very pleased about there is the team has made an increasing number of investments in new product development in that business to refresh some product lines. And so, we're seeing the impact and success of that and we're going to continue to make those investments really focused on things like energy efficiency as one example. But again, I think that it's a similar rebound right now that we're seeing from previous downturns, on a global scale. So, feel good about it, I think, it's sustainable. But again, that really would explain to here in the immediate term what that stronger demand is. And again, we expect that to continue through the second half of this year and into 2022. Yes, that's okay. Thank you. So, if I took them at first in the U.S. our replacement business, which is our book and ship, is very solid there. And we do expect new commercial building to be a bit soft through 2021. So that's not really driving our growth here, it really is a replacement piece. You may have heard us say before, when we talk about commercial, we talk about the institutional sector of commercial, not so much kind of the pure non-res. And that outlook actually is improving. And we think that will further improve just based upon some of the discussions like infrastructure spend, et cetera. We've also seen a healthy activity in Europe where we had double digit growth in the first quarter. That's come from some modest share games as well as we believe the resilience of our supply chain versus some of our peers. And again, really focusing on new product launches it's tied to things like smart drives, again, eco-friendly products being launched, the whole energy efficiency play that we're trying to get ahead of in terms of impending regulations that are coming forward. Thank you. Yes, certainly, and we'll talk more about this at Investor Day with real hard specifics and numbers around that to dimensionalize kind of where we see the conversion kind of pace being within the utilities specifically. But we are encouraged by the adoption there. And that is not only a U.S. phenomenon, we're seeing that in Europe in the emerging markets as well. And it really is \u2013 I think what we see it's tied to most importantly is around affordability. So, as our utility customers are looking to deal with these challenges in front of them around again, scarcity, water equity, building resilient infrastructure, it always comes down to how they're going to pay for it. And that's where we're really getting most traction right now is whether it be around reducing the initial capital outlay because of smarter infrastructure, whether it be reducing things like water losses which is immediate revenue generation for them. Those are the areas that we're seeing most traction right now in that dialogue. And we're seeing some of those pilots that we we've been talking about the last year or more really converting now into sustainable revenues. So absolutely interest, absolutely adoption wish it was even faster. We'll have more to talk about that in the Investor Day. Thank you. Well, thank you. Again, thanks for all of you for your continued interest. We look forward to our Investor Day on September 30. Again, as I mentioned, Matt and the team will be getting the details logistically out to you very shortly. Meanwhile, stay safe, stay well. And we wish you all the very best. Talk to you soon."

Now please turn to Slide 3, and I will turn the call over to our CEO, Patrick Decker.\nPatrick Decker: Thanks, Matt. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We announced earlier this morning that our first quarter results reflect strong operational performance, exceeding our expectations on orders, revenue, margin and earnings per share. The quarter's growth was broad-based, reflecting increasing demand across all of our segments, our end markets and geographies. Our momentum coming into the year accelerated through the quarter, with the team taking full advantage of economic recovery and pent-up demand in our markets. Orders were up double digits in all 3 of our business segments, and backlog was up 23% organically. Both Western Europe and emerging markets delivered exceptional organic revenue growth, with Western Europe up 11% and emerging markets up 33% year-on-year, and with momentum up strong sequentially. U.S. demand also continued to recover with orders up 18%. Alongside top line growth, our results reflect considerable margin expansion. I credit the team's discipline, building on the benefit of volume effects and positive impact from the cost actions we took in 2020. Our financial position, which was robust coming into the quarter, strengthened even further on the combination of revenue growth and margin expansion. Looking forward, we are confident about the remainder of 2021 and beyond. Therefore, we are raising our full year guidance on the top line, margin and EPS. I'll talk a bit more shortly about trends and focus areas for the team. But first, let me hand it over to Sandy to provide more detail on performance in the quarter.\nSandy Rowland: Thank you, Patrick. The first quarter was clearly a meaningful step forward. The team delivered exceptional performance, capitalizing on demand recovery in the majority of our markets. Revenue grew 8% organically versus the same period last year, with performance better than our expectations across the board. Strong double-digit revenue growth in wastewater utilities was paired with broad-based industrial demand recovery. Geographically, emerging markets in Western Europe both grew double digits, while the U.S. was down 1%. I'll touch on revenue performance in more detail covering each of the segments. But in short, utilities were up 3%; industrial was up 14%; commercial, up 5%; and residential was up 31%. Organic orders grew 19% in the quarter as all 3 business segments contributed double-digit order gains. Importantly, it was also the third consecutive quarter of sequential orders improvement. Looking at the key financial metrics. Margins were above our forecasted range with EBITDA margin coming in at 17.1% and operating margin at 11.4%. The 480 basis points of EBITDA expansion came largely from volume and productivity, partially offset by inflation. Earnings per share in the quarter was $0.56, which is up 143%. Please turn to Slide 5, and I'll review our segment performance for the quarter. Water Infrastructure orders in the first quarter were up 14% organically versus last year with revenues up 11%. And geographically, Western Europe grew on healthy demand, while emerging markets delivered strong performance, recovering from a COVID-impacted quarter last year. The U.S. was flattish as double-digit growth in wastewater transport was offset by soft industrial performance. EBITDA margin and operating margin for the segment were up 430 and 490 basis points, respectively, as strong productivity and volume leverage offset inflation. Please turn to Slide 6. In the Applied Water segment, orders were up 25% organically in the quarter, driven by recovery in demand in North America and strength in Western Europe. Revenue was up 13% in the quarter with growth in all end markets and geographies. Residential and industrial grew 31% and 15%, respectively, while commercial grew 5%. Geographically, the U.S. was up modestly as residential and industrial gains were offset by lagging commercial end markets. By contrast, improving commercial demand in Western Europe contributed 15% growth with additional strength in residential. Emerging markets were up 51% due to the timing of prior year COVID shutdowns as well as commercial recovery in Middle East and Africa. Segment EBITDA margin and operating margin grew 250 and 280 basis points, respectively. The expansion came from volume, absorption and productivity. And now please turn to Slide 7, and I'll cover our Measurement & Control Solutions business. In M&CS, orders were up 19% organically in the quarter with double-digit growth across both water and energy applications, driven by large metrology projects. Segment backlog is up 29%. As anticipated, organic revenue growth showed solid quarter sequential improvement, but finished flat year-on-year. Water applications grew in the mid-single digits with strong demand in the test business. In energy applications, revenue was down mid-teens as certain large deployments were completed in the same period last year. Geographically, the U.S. was down mid-single digits, but we anticipate project deployments will ramp through Q2 on loosening site access restrictions and then accelerate through the second half. Emerging markets were up 8%, and Western Europe grew 9% from metrology project deployments and demand in the test business. Segment EBITDA margin and operating margins in the quarter were up 770 and 600 basis points, respectively. Modest price realization and strong productivity savings as well as a prior year warranty charge more than offset inflation. Now, let's turn to Slide 8 for an overview of cash flows and the company's financial position. Our balance sheet continues to be very strong. We closed the quarter with $1.7 billion in cash. Free cash flow was in line with our expectations as well as our historical seasonality patterns. Managing working capital remains an enterprise-wide priority, and we are especially pleased with our accounts receivable performance. Net debt-to-EBITDA leverage was 1.6x at the end of the quarter. Now please turn to slide 9, and I'll turn the call back over to Patrick.\nPatrick Decker: Thanks, Sandy. I'd like to revisit the 3 focus areas we highlighted coming into the year: the performance of our growth platforms, the team's operational discipline and our progress on sustainability. Turning first to our growth platforms. You've already heard about our emerging markets teams exceptional first quarter performance with revenue and orders up 33% and 21%, respectively. Up until now, China and India have taken the spotlight. In both countries, our investments in capabilities and localization have created strong engines for sustainable growth. But of course, other areas of the emerging markets also represent great opportunity for us. Many countries in Eastern Europe, for example, continue to modernize their economies and represent a long runway of investment in Water Infrastructure. And in Africa, there are clearly big water challenges to solve as the higher growth nations continue to urbanize. We expect emerging markets overall will continue to be a source of healthy, sustainable growth for the foreseeable future. The second platform that continues to underpin sustainable growth is our digital strategy. Our broad portfolio enables us to combine multiple digital technologies into integrated offers, including AI-enabled software platforms, advanced communications networks and automated endpoints. Those capabilities have been key to our commercial momentum over the last several quarters with customer adoption of digital solutions accelerating through the pandemic. We've spoken previously about our headline wins in Texas and Ohio. In Q1, we added a large transformation project in Greensboro, North Carolina, and we have just signed another exciting deal to be announced in the next few weeks. All of these projects deliver network-as-a-service, software-as-a-service and advanced analytics. In each case, Xylem's ability to bring a suite of transformational capabilities distinguished us and was essential to winning. And just last week, we further extended the digital capabilities we can offer our customers by partnering with ESRI. ESRI is the global leader in geographic information systems, GIS for short. These systems are an essential component of utility's operating environment. By integrating their technology with our advanced digital solutions, water operators achieved unprecedented network visibility and a clear path to increased operational efficiency and sustainability. And with last week's agreement, Xylem and ESRI are bringing that powerful combination to the water sector together. Our partnership includes developing joint solution road maps and joint selling to water utilities around the world. We are very excited about this partnership and about the value we can deliver to customers together. Turning next to operating discipline. Our operational capabilities were absolutely key to coming through 2020 on strong foundations. As you know, last year, we made difficult but essential decisions on structural cost. And we're now clearly seeing the benefit of those actions. In addition, the team drove strong productivity gains in the first quarter, which offset the early impact of rising inflation. The result was solid margin expansion with incremental margins coming in at 55%. Over the last year, we've learned that we can do more with less, and we will remain absolutely vigilant on cost as economies reopen and demand continues to recover. That said, we are expecting some impact from the broad-based inflation and component supply challenges that are affecting the industrial and tech sectors. Now we've already taken action by strategically investing in inventory to support areas of strong demand, and we will continue driving productivity and pricing to mitigate inflation. Still, the supply environment is likely to remain challenging for some time. The third focus area we highlighted coming into the year was sustainability. I think many of us worried that the cause of sustainability might suffer setbacks through the economic hardships of 2020. However, instead of a retreat, we've actually seen a broad and energetic global embrace of sustainability. As an enterprise over the last year, we've taken several meaningful steps toward our Signature 2025 sustainability goals. We'll be those in our annual sustainability report to be published in June. We'll be reporting, for example, that in 2020, we helped our customers prevent 1.4 billion cubic meters of polluted water from entering local waterways. Now the report is largely retrospective, but of course, we continue to move forward. In 2021, we've deepened and broadened the link between compensation and sustainability performance. It is now a component in the long-term incentive program for a range of key executives. Our commitment and our action has put us in a leadership position, which is both gratifying and a tribute to the team. That said, we all know we have a lot more work ahead of us to deliver on our goals and on our mission and purpose. With that, I'll now hand it back over to Sandy to provide the forward view of our end markets, along with guidance for the remainder of the year.\nSandy Rowland: Thanks, Patrick. Consistent with our previous presentations, we have provided key facts for each end market in the appendix of our slide deck. The outlook for our end markets remains mostly consistent with our view from last quarter with a couple of notable changes. First, in utilities, we continue to see strong commercial momentum in both wastewater and clean water, and anticipate our utility business will grow in the mid to high single digits. On the wastewater side, operators remain focused on mission-critical applications and OpEx needs in the developed markets of Europe and North America. Capital spending outlook and bid activity in China and India remains robust, although we expect some lumpiness in India due to high COVID case rates there. On the clean water side, we are encouraged to see large project deployments beginning to ramp again. Before I move on from utilities, let me briefly touch on the U.S. administration's infrastructure plan. We're clearly positive about the prospect of investment in modernizing the country's water infrastructure. More broadly, the plan could represent an opportunity for communities across the U.S. to invest in greater resilience in several infrastructure categories, which would have the effect of reducing pressure on municipal budgets. We are encouraged by those possibilities. But to be clear, it's too early to know whether and in what form the plan may emerge from Congress, who have not built specific upside into our expectations. Please turn to Slide 11. The second notable change in our outlook is in the industrial end market. We have seen a rebound in global industrial activity and sentiment across all 3 of our business segments. We expect healthy growth in emerging markets in Western Europe to continue in the first half, while North America will deliver modest growth. And then we anticipate those relative market performances will flip in the second half, primarily because of the compares. Importantly, the industrial dewatering business is recovering, driven by demand in construction, mining and other verticals. And we now expect the industrial end market to grow in the mid-single digits for the year. Our outlook in the commercial segment remains unchanged. We continue to expect our commercial end market to be up low single digits. We are gaining share in Europe on healthy demand, and the U.S. replacement business is stable, although new commercial building is expected to be soft for most of 2021. In residential, we now anticipate high single-digit to low double-digit growth for the full year, which is up modestly from our previous expectation of mid to high single digits. We do expect growth will moderate through the second half due largely to prior year comparisons. Now, let's turn to Slide 12, and I'll walk you through our updated guidance. As you can see, we are raising our previous annual guidance. For Xylem overall, we now see full year 2021 organic revenue growth in the range of 5% to 7%, up from our previous guidance of 3% to 5%. This breaks down by segment as follows: mid to high single-digit growth in Water Infrastructure, up from low to mid single-digit growth previously; mid to high single-digit growth in Applied Water, up from low single-digit growth; and in Measurement & Control Solutions, we expect -- we continue to expect mid single-digit growth. While we anticipate delivering a number of large project deployments, growth may be somewhat constrained by component supply challenges. For 2021, we expect adjusted EBITDA margin to be up 90 to 140 basis points to a range of 17.2% to 17.7%. For your convenience, we are also providing the equivalent adjusted operating margin here, which we now expect to be in the range of 12% to 12.5%, up 120 to 170 basis points. This higher range reflects our expectation that volume, price and productivity gains will more than offset inflation. Benefits from restructuring savings remain unchanged, and this yields an adjusted EPS range of $2.50 to $2.70, an increase of 21% to 31% over last year. We continue to expect free cash flow conversion of between 80% to 90%, as previously guided, putting our 3-year average right around 130%. And we expect to continue delivering cash conversion of greater than 100% going forward. Our balance sheet will remain very strong even after $600 million of senior notes are retired in the fourth quarter, which clearly offers considerable room for capital deployment. We are continually assessing inorganic opportunities to strengthen our strategic position, differentiate our portfolio and enhance market access. We have provided you with a number of other full year assumptions to supplement your models. Those assumptions are unchanged from our original guidance, including our euro to dollar conversion rate of 1.22. And as you know, foreign exchange can be volatile, and therefore, we have included a foreign exchange sensitivity table in the appendix. Now drilling down on the second quarter. We anticipate total company organic revenues will grow in the range of 8% to 10%. This includes high single-digit growth in Water Infrastructure, low teens growth in Applied Water and mid-single digits growth in M&CS. We expect second quarter adjusted EBITDA margin to be in the range of 16.7% to 17.2%, representing 140 to 190 basis points of expansion versus the prior year. And with that, please turn to Slide 13, and I'll turn the call back over to Patrick for closing comments.\nPatrick Decker: Thanks, Sandy. Xylem is clearly in a strong position coming out of Q1, and we expect this momentum to continue throughout the rest of the year and beyond. Demand recovery and strong commercial performance will drive organic growth. Operating discipline will deliver margin expansion and strong cash conversion. And a robust balance sheet will continue to underpin our strategy. More broadly, our business and mission have never been more relevant than they are today. The economic and social value of critical infrastructure is more apparent than ever. Not only it is critical in times of crisis, but also as a driver of economic recovery, and it's a prerequisite for broader prosperity. From the shocks of the last year, the world has embraced the need for greater resilience and the imperative of a sustainable future. In that context, our mission, our business and our values put us in a privileged position, which will enable us to continue creating both economic and social value for our stakeholders over the medium and long term. We look forward to providing an update on our strategy and long-term plans at our next Investor Day, which is currently planned for September 30. It will most likely be a combined virtual and physical format, but we do hope to host as many of you as possible COVID restrictions permitting. Matt and the team will follow up with more details as soon as they're pinned down. Now with that, we'd be happy to take any questions you may have. So operator, please lead us into Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Scott Davis with Melius Research.\nScott Davis: Congrats on the incrementals. Good to see, for sure. I'm not sure, Sandy, if you mentioned anything about price. I didn't hear it in the prepared remarks. But is price generally up with your cost structure? Is there any color you can give us there?\nSandy Rowland: Yes, sure, Scott. So I think you're asking specifically about the first quarter. If we look at our first quarter performance around price, it's basically flat. It's slightly positive and very much in line with our expectations. We did go out with a price increase, but that was back-end loaded in the quarter. It didn't take effect until the back half of March. As -- we're not unique. We're seeing increased inflation headwinds. And so we do expect to see more realization on the price front as the year unfolds. We do have a second price increase that will take effect later in the second quarter. And that actually was a higher price increase than what we went out with earlier in March. So.\nPatrick Decker: And Scott, from our past experience, the teams are doing rather good job on making sure the pricing sticks. So we get pretty good realization when we go out with these price increases. And I think the market is clearly expecting something from us and our competitors.\nScott Davis: Okay. That's helpful. And then it sounds like this quarter, at least, you have a lot higher confidence on the meter deployments. Is it -- has visibility -- is it -- clearly site access is an issue kind of everywhere still. But is the increased confidence more around the efficacy of vaccines and some reopening in developed markets? Or is there other -- any other factors that you want to discuss?\nSandy Rowland: Yes. I think, Scott, I'll look at the data, right? So very encouraged about the projects that we have lined up from a deployment perspective. As we kind of track, we book an award. It goes into our backlog. The next phase is that we receive tangible orders from our customers. And then you start to see it reflected in our revenue. And so we're kind of at that middle stage now. If you look at our orders performance in the quarter, within M&CS, we're right about 20% orders growth year-over-year. And a big piece of that is the large project deployment starting to convert into tangible orders, so.\nPatrick Decker: And we saw -- Scott, to your question, it absolutely is being driven largely by sites opening up, not everywhere. But part of that is, again, the vaccine being distributed. I think part of it is just growing confidence in the part of the utilities to move forward with these projects. And that's also what drove our strong order growth and backlog growth in dewatering that we're seeing at this point in time is site access.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.\nDeane Dray: I would like to talk about guidance and some of the embedded assumptions here. First of all, I fully recognize it's a first quarter, and you guys don't typically boost guidance. So that's for starter is different. And we certainly recognize there's lots of COVID uncertainty still. We're early in the year. But -- so it really does flag the just the questions about component shortages. And the second quarter guide looks fine. And just that looks perfectly fine. So you're probably pretty locked in, in terms of visibility on the component supply. So is this a second half component supply? Just a risk? And maybe you can give us some more details about what particular components? I know it's probably changes day-to-day, but just as it stands today, which ones are -- where the supply chains are more stretched in a meaningful way?\nSandy Rowland: Yes. Sure, Dean. Let me start with some color. First of all, we think that our team did a really good job in the first quarter in meeting supply in what was a challenging supply chain environment. We feel like we're in good shape for Q2. And we're continuing to monitor the situation for the back half of the year. It's a fairly dynamic situation. And we have certain components, microchips that look good and then that can change and then we solve that problem. So it's a dynamic situation. Our team is on top of it, very focused on it. We've worked -- we work closely with our contract manufacturer partners, and they're very plugged in and larger than we are. And so we think that provides some protection. But having said that, it's a risk item for the second half of the year. And so we want to be measured and watch how this unfolds over the next 90 days. And next time together, we'll come back to you with an update.\nPatrick Decker: And this is -- Dean, as you well know, this is happening across our sector, especially in the metrology piece of the business. But it's broad -- it's widespread across the sector. So it's not really creating any competitive pressure right now. It would be a matter of -- if we had shortage, things would move to the right in terms of installations, et cetera. So we're not seeing that as of yet. But it certainly -- if it's a risk, it would be a risk in the latter part of the year.\nDeane Dray: That's good to hear. And so certainly, that's helpful in terms of the assumptions. And then the second question is a broader discussion around the ESRI partnership because it really looks like this has significant implications and expanding your offerings in smart water, especially applications using artificial intelligence in this -- the launch project with the utility that you cite, the water main feature. So just talk about specific applications? What does ESRI bring to the table? A little more color about this utility deal using AI for water main monitoring? And then any color on the economics of the partnership? Is this shared economics? And how is that structured?\nPatrick Decker: Sure. Yes. So on the -- in terms of what problem are we trying to solve for here? Particularly with the utilities, we already had some of our businesses working with ESRI. That was our pipeline condition assessment business, the formalin is pure as well as was water, which does a lot of the kind of valve pipe replacement work for utilities. And so really building off of that long-term partnership, but really expanding now across the rest of our portfolio that is sold into the utility. So it really is about harnessing the power of the geographical data that ESRI has -- they've got a very large share base of utilities around the world. This is not limited to a U.S. opportunity. We think that the power of the collective. I know they are very, very excited about working with us because what they don't have right now -- we don't have access to the weather data they do. At the same time, they don't have the deep subject matter expertise of being able to advise the utility on how to use this data to go address pipeline issues or water treatment plan issues, whatever challenges that utility may be facing and that's what they're looking for us to really bring in. And they see it's the power and breadth of our portfolio since we're not limited on a few offerings in terms of equipment. The case study example of the 1 utility that we talked about in the Mid-Atlantic, we help them reduce their non-revenue water through a 4x reduction in pipe failures. And that 1 project is going to end up cutting their pipe replacement cost by $70 million. On the commercial side of the relationship, I'd rather not get into details on that right now. We can perhaps cover that maybe at our Investor Day later in the year.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Patrick, you mentioned that China was up 90%, I think, year-over-year. So while it's an easy comparison versus last year, I think you had a 36% drop. I do think you put your business there well over where it was pre-COVID. So can you talk about what is going on over there in terms of your penetration to that market? You mentioned strength in transport and treatment. But maybe you could talk about how much is just more awareness about water sustainability, your own sustainable growth strategy? How much that's helping you in emerging markets? And what it could mean for Xylem's underlying growth moving forward?\nPatrick Decker: Yes, sure. Great question. I would say that -- you're right, part of the growth in Q1 is an easy comp, but we are expecting double-digit growth for the full year in China. It's really -- it's broad-based. It really is cutting across each one of our end markets. So it's not limited to treatment or transport or utilities even -- part of that is, again, there has been improvement in China in terms of side access, kind of an opening up more broadly of the economy. And so we see that investment flowing. From a long-term perspective, there really are -- we see a couple of key drivers here. The whole focus on sustainability and environmental impact by the central government there, which has been part of their long-range plan for a while now, is driving real investment, and we see that in our bidding pipeline and our project backlog. Secondly, it is really being driven also, from a competitive standpoint, by all of the work that we've done over the number of years to localize our supply chain as well as strengthening our engineering capabilities on the ground there and our selling capabilities. We've got a great team there, and we've got a quite strong brand name actually across China, especially on the utility side.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Got it. And then, Sandy, just following up on Dean's question. It looks like your implied incremental margins in the second half of the year are quite a bit lower than Q1. We know you have more difficult comparisons in the second half. But is your second half guidance reflecting just conservatism regarding the component shortages we just talked about and price versus cost? And would you say -- would you just be careful about how we model M&CS margin improvement given those issues?\nSandy Rowland: Yes. So good question, Andy. I think first of all, when we went out with our guidance for the full year of 2021, we did expect that the margin expansion would be stronger first half, second half. And there's multiple reasons for that. So starting with the restructuring actions that we took in 2020, we realized about $70 million of restructuring and structural cost benefit last year. About $50 million of that was in the back half of the year. And we're calling for about $60 million of restructuring savings in 2021, and that will be more front-end loaded. So 2/3 of that should come in the first half. So you have a little bit of a difference from a timing perspective on the restructuring side. And then the other thing is some of our discretionary costs. We took out about $60 million of discretionary costs last year. And in our plan, we have about 40% of that returning. That actually was a tailwind for us in Q1 because we've had travel and other items going on last year in Q1. That will start to flip in the second half of the year and become a headwind. And the other area, I think that it's really important is, we've strategically staggered the timing and phase, the timing of our investments. And so those are to support our growth platform. So things like building out our digital platform, continuing to -- we just talked about the emerging markets. We're expanding our channel in the emerging markets. We're continuing to focus on localization. And so those investments will come in higher in the second half of the year. And I think the new thing is that inflation and -- has continued to tick up. And while we're taking pricing actions, they don't always perfectly offset from a timing perspective. And certainly, we're watching the supply chain constraints closely.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones with Stifel.\nNathan Jones: Patrick, I'd like to start off with a comment you made in your prepared remarks talking about network-as-a-service. I know you guys have been testing various business models around that area. Has there been some movement on potentially putting Xylem's balance sheet to work a little bit more to transform the business model around how some of those things work? Any comments you can give around that initiative there?\nPatrick Decker: Yes. We do a combination of structures. And these are not actually for us, large-scale investments that are required. So I wouldn't want to spook anybody on the call thinking that when we say we'd be using our balance sheet, that we're talking about something larger than what it actually is. These are rather small investments in a network that we can make. And it oftentimes happens when maybe there's a consortium of utilities where on their own they can't really afford it, they don't need to have it, dedicated to them. So we will make the investment, and we'll lease it back to them. It does address the affordability issues for the utility for the customer. But that's not the only model we do. I mean there are customers that literally make the investment themselves. And so, two different models there. I would say we're still in early-stage of scaling. And again, we'll have -- we have much more to share there in Investor Day in September.\nNathan Jones: Fair enough. The next one -- my follow-up question then on productivity. I think productivity in the quarter was 510 basis points, which I don't think I've seen a number that high out of Xylem before in that category. Can you talk about what exactly goes into the productivity bucket? And what drove such good performance there in the first quarter?\nSandy Rowland: Yes. So we've put a number of things in that bucket. And first of all, I need to give a shout out to the team because the performance in the first quarter was exceptional and stronger than what we had modeled. So we put things in there like our continuous improvement activities that take place in our manufacturing centers and within our supply chain. We also put our procurement negotiation upside that comes through productivity. That kind of offset some of the inflation headwinds that we're feeling as we're able to incorporate things like value engineering or better designs for existing products. Our restructuring savings were a contributor this quarter as well. That was about 100 basis points, purely restructuring and other structural cost savings, takeout was another 100, 150 basis points. So it's really a combination of a number of factors, and every -- all parts of it contributed this quarter.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Connors with Boenning & Scattergood.\nRyan Connors: I think you slides in Q&A, have been very comprehensive. So I just kind of have a couple of bigger picture questions. Patrick, you talked earlier about the sort of tech to M&CS side of the business. And I understand that smart water is sort of an irresistible theme. But M&CS, it's kind of lagged the growth and profitability relative to other parts of the portfolio. You're not alone in that. We've seen that from some other peers as well, where sort of the more boring business, if you will, actually outperforms some of the sexier stuff, if you will. And what are your thoughts on that? And to what extent can we conclude from that, that maybe boring is good in mature markets with good channels that are established or good? And how does that inform your M&A mindset going forward?\nPatrick Decker: Yes. So obviously, we love all of our businesses. So I don't consider them being boring. But I know that's a bit tongue and shake on your part. The -- but if we think about our -- kind of our core businesses over the history of Xylem, we continue to invest organically in those businesses, and we've done some small tuck-in bolt-ons like in treatment, et cetera, as well. But we're increasing that investment in the second half of the year to where about 2/3 of the investment that we're going to be making in the second half is weighted towards kind of the core equipment product offerings that we need to do. The remainder really being in more the digital side. From an M&A standpoint, we are open. We evaluate opportunities across the spectrum for each one of our businesses in this segment because, hereby, it's really important that we maintain and extend our market share leadership in those businesses and not be purely fixated on just what's going on within M&CS. So that's a big theme across the company right now. In terms of the dynamics of slower ramp in top line growth and margin expansion in M&CS. I know we said this before, and you began to see that here in the first quarter. That really is a function of timing. I mean as these large deals begin to get deployed over the course of this year, second half and then next year and beyond, you're going to see that turn, especially when we look at it from an EBITDA standpoint relative to the rest of Xylem.\nRyan Connors: Okay. That's helpful. And then my second one was, again, another big picture question, Patrick. You're an important kind of voice in this industry. And I want to get your response to something as it relates to federal dollars, right? So we've seen some great progress in the last decade on full cost pricing by local water systems. We've seen great progress on consolidation and acquisitions by investor-owned players who are great customers for you, as you've demonstrated in your past Analyst Day's and so forth. So my question is, to what extent does a big infusion of sort of no strings attached to federal money into that sector put those sustainable drivers of full cost progress and consolidation at risk? In other words, you throw a lifeline, they don't have to increase price, they can even lower price, they don't have to sell through investor-owned. What are your thoughts on that and the risks associated with federal money coming in, in a big way?\nPatrick Decker: Yes. It's a great question. And the answer right now is no one really knows because nothing has been approved yet. But I think directionally, as you well know, historically, CapEx in the U.S. water utility space, which is really what we're talking about is more on the CapEx side, has not been funded by federal legislation. And so if this pilot money comes through -- I mean quite frankly, on a relative basis, right now, the number is around $110 billion, I believe. That to me personally is underwhelming relative to the price tag of the rest of infrastructure was being kicked around. And so I think by the time you spread that out across the utilities in the states or at a local level, I don't think it's going to put as much pressure on utilities, as you pointed out. Moving away from otherwise progress they would be forced to make to protect their investments. So we'll see when we get there. That's not the rumbling that we're getting. I mean we stay close, for example, to NACA, which you will know is the North American Clean Water Association. And that's one of the questions we ask of those large utility players, is what do they think about the proposed bill? They're encouraged, but they're not making any plans based on it right now. I mean not at least widespread.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Connor Lynagh with Morgan Stanley.\nConnor Lynagh: I think we've spent a fair bit of time on the chip supply chain issues, but obviously, there's plenty of issues in sort of basic commodities as well. I was wondering if you could just discuss any sort of material pressure you're feeling from steel or copper or anything like that? What your sort of sourcing strategy is? And if we should expect any sort of impact on your margins from that?\nSandy Rowland: Yes. So thanks for the question, Connor. We're feeling -- it's something that we're watching closely, both from an inflation perspective and a shortage perspective. Particularly from a shortage perspective around resins and plastics, we think that the storm that took place earlier in the year in Texas put some pressure on the global -- on the supply chain. And our teams have been working at that, and I think they've been making good progress. And so when it comes to plastic shortages, we feel good about the supply that we've secured for the second quarter. And I think we're in a good place from a momentum perspective. Still work to do, but those are kind of resolving themselves in a favorable way. We're seeing inflation in copper, aluminum and steel. And that's an important part of why we've gone out with the second price increase in the second quarter.\nConnor Lynagh: Yes. Understood. So I think in the bridge you provided, it seems like price-cost is pretty neutral thus far. I mean I think you were guiding the full year to be marginally dilutive. Any updated thoughts on that? Just how you're thinking about all those different moving parts there?\nSandy Rowland: Yes. I think that hasn't changed. But when you incorporate the productivity that we're going to continue to drive out of our manufacturing sites and within our supply chain that will be on the positive side of that.\nPatrick Decker: And I think partly what we're really suggesting here is the uncertainty continues around the supply chain, in areas that -- it's moving around, and we've just gone out with price increases, and we have another one being rolled out. So we really want to see how that sticks and how that plays out as we get through Q2. And then we'll have a better view on the second half at that point.\nConnor Lynagh: Yes, understood. I guess where I'm ultimately driving with this is you're starting from a very nice place on margins, particularly in the Water Infrastructure and Applied Water businesses. It doesn't sound like you're seeing anything right now that would suggest we should assume an abnormal seasonal trend, which usually is a positive one. Correct?\nSandy Rowland: No. I think if you look at what we implied through our guide, you'll see margin expansion in the second half compared to the first half. So we are -- I think we're off to a great start. And we're -- on a quarter -- on a sequential basis, you should see margin expansion in the second half as well.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Saree Boroditsky with Jefferies.\nSaree Boroditsky: Just a follow-up on your pricing commentary. You talked about this other price increase in the second quarter. But given your strong orders and backlog, how do you think about when you actually see the benefit of this price increase?\nSandy Rowland: Yes. I think that's a good question. There have been some orders that have been placed to take advantage of pre-price, before the price increase takes effect. And so that's why what we've modeled is that we'll see greater price realization coming in Q3 and Q4 as we work through the existing orders that are in backlog.\nSaree Boroditsky: And then it looks like the 25% order increase in Applied Water was partially attributed to extended lead times in North America. How should we think about the impact of this? And how is underlying demand trending?\nSandy Rowland: Yes. So first of all, with 25% year-over-year growth, there is definitely an uptick in demand. And so we can't dismiss. We think that there was some placement of orders a little bit earlier than normal because many, many companies are dealing with the supply chain constraints and shortages. And so customers want to get -- they want to be first in line to protect their supply. But net-net, very good performance. We're seeing good recovery on the industrial side. Residential remains strong. And commercial is starting to come back, particularly outside of the U.S.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Graham with Rosenblatt.\nScott Graham: Sandy, complements on your handle over the details, just really impressive. I'm hoping to maybe tap into that a little bit more on the productivity. I know some questions have been asked around the productivity of 510 basis points. Certainly, we know that discretionary was a little bit additive within that. And so structural, you said 100 to 150. But or that still leaves a lot of just sort of core productivity improvement in the quarter. And I'm just wondering if you can kind of take us underneath that a little bit and what that would look like for the rest of the year?\nSandy Rowland: Yes. So if we look at Q1, what we're seeing is about 70 basis points from -- came from what we call continuous improvement. And that's hard work that takes place day after day in our manufacturing centers. And then our procurement organization delivered about 220 basis points of savings this quarter, which was a really good number. And so I think that's a high number. But net-net, this productivity element is a core part of our planned margin expansion for the year, and we're very glad to start seeing it right out of the gate.\nScott Graham: So you think that, that -- you just laid out, that 300 is sustainable for the rest of the year?\nSandy Rowland: The -- our full year projection around productivity is right around 300 basis points.\nScott Graham: Okay. So then that would imply that, that comes off a little bit in the second half. I understand.\nSandy Rowland: The first quarter was very strong.\nScott Graham: Yes, get it. This is one for you, Patrick. I didn't hear mention of AIA. Just maybe you can kind of -- assuming you still called that. But kind of give us sort of what was the sales growth? And what you've called AIA? And what is the thinking for the full year?\nPatrick Decker: Sure. Matt, why don't you go through the numbers, and I'll talk about what we're seeing in terms of just momentum in the business. And we have -- I mean we still show it that from a reporting standpoint as AIA within the M&CS segment. But from a branding standpoint, we now refer a piece of that, which is the pure digital as Xylem view, which is our consultative business. And then we have the Pipeline Condition Assessment business, the artist formally known as Pure that's in there as well. So, those are two very different businesses, and they're now run separately. We saw nice momentum in both businesses. Matt can share the detailed numbers. But really good look at bidding activity on the digital side, order growth, backlog growth, margins, strong incremental margins on that business. So that team that we set up last year really is beginning to get some big traction now, not just with utilities in the U.S. but also across emerging markets in Europe.\nMatt Latino: Yes, Scott. I would just say, looking at it in a whole, right, in terms of AIA, we've been down a little bit in the first quarter. Most of that is pure because seasonally, this is usually a slower period of time for them, doing a lot of that in-pipeline assessment service work. It's harder to do, as you know, in the lot colder freezing temperature. So down a little bit. That was expected. They both are kind of on target for what our plan was. That will ramp. We're seeing good activity, good interest, bidding around both of the businesses. Some good orders, good momentum on the BU side. And we'll have more to share about that digital strategy and the component that is view at Investor Day. But I think importantly, too, it's also their synergies with that view business into other parts of the business. And so for example, we highlighted that Greensboro win that we had this quarter. And that is an AMI deployment, but it also comes with some digital components in terms of pipeline condition assessment service, on the water piece. So it addresses nonrevenue water. And also our Valor analytics technology that goes at the meters that need to be replaced and targeted first to address. So both of those are in that deal. It's nice to see that bidding and scope work getting expanded.\nPatrick Decker: And I would say, Scott, it was those digital capabilities that were, in some cases, the distinguishing competitive advantage that really kind of helped get it across the finishing line.\nScott Graham: Yes. That was something you've been talking about for a while, Patrick.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Lee with Goldman Sachs.\nBrian Lee: I just wanted to maybe talk about M&CS for a second. It's the only segment that isn't getting a bump up in the outlook for the guidance. So just trying to understand how much of that is just project timing and visibility not having improved or changed much versus just building in more risk for supply chain issues? So maybe the puts and takes there as you thought about providing the updated guidance here? And if it is some of the latter. I know you talked about this a little bit, but what specific actions are you taking to mitigate? Are you adding new suppliers? Are you building inventory? I just want to better understand kind of what the situation is there?\nSandy Rowland: Yes. Thanks, Brian. Good question. I think from the orders growth, if we did not have supply chain constraints, we would have likely increased the guidance there because the large project deployments, which is a core part of our plan, are coming through in line with our expectations, and our customers are ready to go, which we're very, very encouraged about. But the situation on the electronics components is very, very dynamic. And so we want to continue to monitor and see how that plays out over the next few months. And we've taken extra inventory where it was possible. It takes a little bit of time to substitute parts out and get those certified, but that's something that our team is also working on. And I think we're not alone here. So I think this is well understood in the industry that there's a shortage of microchips. And so far, we've kept everything up and going, and we're going to keep fighting.\nPatrick Decker: Yes, we have been -- I mean we have been working to qualify additional suppliers. But the predominant work that's been done is to work closely with our largest contract manufacturer, which is Flextronics. And obviously, with their large procurement capabilities in the mass procurement they do, we've got a really nice partnership with them, and we've been able to make sure at this point that we're getting our fair share of the components that are out there despite the shortage. And we just got to stay close to them and keep working that through the year.\nBrian Lee: Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then maybe one for you, Patrick, and I'll pass it on. Just a high level, big picture outlook for M&A. You guys obviously have a very healthy balance sheet, sticking to the free cash flow view here for the year. Generally, what are you seeing in terms of multiples out there? Are there -- is there anything more attractive in the context of your stock having done well over the past year? And then just what focus areas or holes you might be looking to address in the portfolio here?\nPatrick Decker: Yes. No, thanks. M&A is clearly an important piece of our long-term strategy, and so we continue to actively cultivate the pipeline. It is a very robust pipeline. It's very active. We would really be focused on further strengthening our digital platform, really diversifying some of our end market concentration. So as we said before, perhaps something in the industrial water space. And then, of course, as I mentioned earlier, always look at opportunities to strengthen our core. In terms of valuation, we have seen some multiple inflation there, but really tends to be around things in the digital space of scale. We've not been actively participating in some of those deals have been announced here recently because we like the portfolio that we've got. But we're always in the game on those in terms of looking at it. But we do want to be disciplined on valuation. What I would say is I acknowledge your comment and that is we've got a strong balance sheet, our equity is a valuable currency right now and both of those give us, we think, relative advantage to bring some of these differentiated assets into our portfolio. There is a reminder that we've got this $600 million note that's due in early Q4. So we -- that's not going to constrain us. But as you all are modeling cash and balance sheet, just make sure that you keep that in mind.\nOperator: We have reached the end of our allotted time for questions. I will now turn the floor back over to Patrick Decker for additional or closing remarks.\nPatrick Decker: Thank you. Well, thank you all for joining and for your continued interest and engagement here. Really appreciate the support. Look forward to seeing you again on our next earnings call, but also at our Investor Day, September 30. Matt and the team will be reaching out and coordinating with all of you to make sure that we get that scheduled for you. And so in the meantime, again, have a great remainder of your spring and summer. Stay safe. Stay well. And all the best of your families and colleagues. We'll see you soon.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude today's Xylem First Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Please disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Sandy Rowland",
            "content": "Thank you, Patrick. The first quarter was clearly a meaningful step forward. The team delivered exceptional performance, capitalizing on demand recovery in the majority of our markets. Revenue grew 8% organically versus the same period last year, with performance better than our expectations across the board. Strong double-digit revenue growth in wastewater utilities was paired with broad-based industrial demand recovery. Geographically, emerging markets in Western Europe both grew double digits, while the U.S. was down 1%. I'll touch on revenue performance in more detail covering each of the segments. But in short, utilities were up 3%; industrial was up 14%; commercial, up 5%; and residential was up 31%. Organic orders grew 19% in the quarter as all 3 business segments contributed double-digit order gains. Importantly, it was also the third consecutive quarter of sequential orders improvement. Looking at the key financial metrics. Margins were above our forecasted range with EBITDA margin coming in at 17.1% and operating margin at 11.4%. The 480 basis points of EBITDA expansion came largely from volume and productivity, partially offset by inflation. Earnings per share in the quarter was $0.56, which is up 143%. Please turn to Slide 5, and I'll review our segment performance for the quarter. Water Infrastructure orders in the first quarter were up 14% organically versus last year with revenues up 11%. And geographically, Western Europe grew on healthy demand, while emerging markets delivered strong performance, recovering from a COVID-impacted quarter last year. The U.S. was flattish as double-digit growth in wastewater transport was offset by soft industrial performance. EBITDA margin and operating margin for the segment were up 430 and 490 basis points, respectively, as strong productivity and volume leverage offset inflation. Please turn to Slide 6. In the Applied Water segment, orders were up 25% organically in the quarter, driven by recovery in demand in North America and strength in Western Europe. Revenue was up 13% in the quarter with growth in all end markets and geographies. Residential and industrial grew 31% and 15%, respectively, while commercial grew 5%. Geographically, the U.S. was up modestly as residential and industrial gains were offset by lagging commercial end markets. By contrast, improving commercial demand in Western Europe contributed 15% growth with additional strength in residential. Emerging markets were up 51% due to the timing of prior year COVID shutdowns as well as commercial recovery in Middle East and Africa. Segment EBITDA margin and operating margin grew 250 and 280 basis points, respectively. The expansion came from volume, absorption and productivity. And now please turn to Slide 7, and I'll cover our Measurement & Control Solutions business. In M&CS, orders were up 19% organically in the quarter with double-digit growth across both water and energy applications, driven by large metrology projects. Segment backlog is up 29%. As anticipated, organic revenue growth showed solid quarter sequential improvement, but finished flat year-on-year. Water applications grew in the mid-single digits with strong demand in the test business. In energy applications, revenue was down mid-teens as certain large deployments were completed in the same period last year. Geographically, the U.S. was down mid-single digits, but we anticipate project deployments will ramp through Q2 on loosening site access restrictions and then accelerate through the second half. Emerging markets were up 8%, and Western Europe grew 9% from metrology project deployments and demand in the test business. Segment EBITDA margin and operating margins in the quarter were up 770 and 600 basis points, respectively. Modest price realization and strong productivity savings as well as a prior year warranty charge more than offset inflation. Now, let's turn to Slide 8 for an overview of cash flows and the company's financial position. Our balance sheet continues to be very strong. We closed the quarter with $1.7 billion in cash. Free cash flow was in line with our expectations as well as our historical seasonality patterns. Managing working capital remains an enterprise-wide priority, and we are especially pleased with our accounts receivable performance. Net debt-to-EBITDA leverage was 1.6x at the end of the quarter. Now please turn to slide 9, and I'll turn the call back over to Patrick. Thanks, Patrick. Consistent with our previous presentations, we have provided key facts for each end market in the appendix of our slide deck. The outlook for our end markets remains mostly consistent with our view from last quarter with a couple of notable changes. First, in utilities, we continue to see strong commercial momentum in both wastewater and clean water, and anticipate our utility business will grow in the mid to high single digits. On the wastewater side, operators remain focused on mission-critical applications and OpEx needs in the developed markets of Europe and North America. Capital spending outlook and bid activity in China and India remains robust, although we expect some lumpiness in India due to high COVID case rates there. On the clean water side, we are encouraged to see large project deployments beginning to ramp again. Before I move on from utilities, let me briefly touch on the U.S. administration's infrastructure plan. We're clearly positive about the prospect of investment in modernizing the country's water infrastructure. More broadly, the plan could represent an opportunity for communities across the U.S. to invest in greater resilience in several infrastructure categories, which would have the effect of reducing pressure on municipal budgets. We are encouraged by those possibilities. But to be clear, it's too early to know whether and in what form the plan may emerge from Congress, who have not built specific upside into our expectations. Please turn to Slide 11. The second notable change in our outlook is in the industrial end market. We have seen a rebound in global industrial activity and sentiment across all 3 of our business segments. We expect healthy growth in emerging markets in Western Europe to continue in the first half, while North America will deliver modest growth. And then we anticipate those relative market performances will flip in the second half, primarily because of the compares. Importantly, the industrial dewatering business is recovering, driven by demand in construction, mining and other verticals. And we now expect the industrial end market to grow in the mid-single digits for the year. Our outlook in the commercial segment remains unchanged. We continue to expect our commercial end market to be up low single digits. We are gaining share in Europe on healthy demand, and the U.S. replacement business is stable, although new commercial building is expected to be soft for most of 2021. In residential, we now anticipate high single-digit to low double-digit growth for the full year, which is up modestly from our previous expectation of mid to high single digits. We do expect growth will moderate through the second half due largely to prior year comparisons. Now, let's turn to Slide 12, and I'll walk you through our updated guidance. As you can see, we are raising our previous annual guidance. For Xylem overall, we now see full year 2021 organic revenue growth in the range of 5% to 7%, up from our previous guidance of 3% to 5%. This breaks down by segment as follows: mid to high single-digit growth in Water Infrastructure, up from low to mid single-digit growth previously; mid to high single-digit growth in Applied Water, up from low single-digit growth; and in Measurement & Control Solutions, we expect -- we continue to expect mid single-digit growth. While we anticipate delivering a number of large project deployments, growth may be somewhat constrained by component supply challenges. For 2021, we expect adjusted EBITDA margin to be up 90 to 140 basis points to a range of 17.2% to 17.7%. For your convenience, we are also providing the equivalent adjusted operating margin here, which we now expect to be in the range of 12% to 12.5%, up 120 to 170 basis points. This higher range reflects our expectation that volume, price and productivity gains will more than offset inflation. Benefits from restructuring savings remain unchanged, and this yields an adjusted EPS range of $2.50 to $2.70, an increase of 21% to 31% over last year. We continue to expect free cash flow conversion of between 80% to 90%, as previously guided, putting our 3-year average right around 130%. And we expect to continue delivering cash conversion of greater than 100% going forward. Our balance sheet will remain very strong even after $600 million of senior notes are retired in the fourth quarter, which clearly offers considerable room for capital deployment. We are continually assessing inorganic opportunities to strengthen our strategic position, differentiate our portfolio and enhance market access. We have provided you with a number of other full year assumptions to supplement your models. Those assumptions are unchanged from our original guidance, including our euro to dollar conversion rate of 1.22. And as you know, foreign exchange can be volatile, and therefore, we have included a foreign exchange sensitivity table in the appendix. Now drilling down on the second quarter. We anticipate total company organic revenues will grow in the range of 8% to 10%. This includes high single-digit growth in Water Infrastructure, low teens growth in Applied Water and mid-single digits growth in M&CS. We expect second quarter adjusted EBITDA margin to be in the range of 16.7% to 17.2%, representing 140 to 190 basis points of expansion versus the prior year. And with that, please turn to Slide 13, and I'll turn the call back over to Patrick for closing comments. Yes, sure, Scott. So I think you're asking specifically about the first quarter. If we look at our first quarter performance around price, it's basically flat. It's slightly positive and very much in line with our expectations. We did go out with a price increase, but that was back-end loaded in the quarter. It didn't take effect until the back half of March. As -- we're not unique. We're seeing increased inflation headwinds. And so we do expect to see more realization on the price front as the year unfolds. We do have a second price increase that will take effect later in the second quarter. And that actually was a higher price increase than what we went out with earlier in March. So. Yes. I think, Scott, I'll look at the data, right? So very encouraged about the projects that we have lined up from a deployment perspective. As we kind of track, we book an award. It goes into our backlog. The next phase is that we receive tangible orders from our customers. And then you start to see it reflected in our revenue. And so we're kind of at that middle stage now. If you look at our orders performance in the quarter, within M&CS, we're right about 20% orders growth year-over-year. And a big piece of that is the large project deployment starting to convert into tangible orders, so. Yes. Sure, Dean. Let me start with some color. First of all, we think that our team did a really good job in the first quarter in meeting supply in what was a challenging supply chain environment. We feel like we're in good shape for Q2. And we're continuing to monitor the situation for the back half of the year. It's a fairly dynamic situation. And we have certain components, microchips that look good and then that can change and then we solve that problem. So it's a dynamic situation. Our team is on top of it, very focused on it. We've worked -- we work closely with our contract manufacturer partners, and they're very plugged in and larger than we are. And so we think that provides some protection. But having said that, it's a risk item for the second half of the year. And so we want to be measured and watch how this unfolds over the next 90 days. And next time together, we'll come back to you with an update. Yes. So good question, Andy. I think first of all, when we went out with our guidance for the full year of 2021, we did expect that the margin expansion would be stronger first half, second half. And there's multiple reasons for that. So starting with the restructuring actions that we took in 2020, we realized about $70 million of restructuring and structural cost benefit last year. About $50 million of that was in the back half of the year. And we're calling for about $60 million of restructuring savings in 2021, and that will be more front-end loaded. So 2/3 of that should come in the first half. So you have a little bit of a difference from a timing perspective on the restructuring side. And then the other thing is some of our discretionary costs. We took out about $60 million of discretionary costs last year. And in our plan, we have about 40% of that returning. That actually was a tailwind for us in Q1 because we've had travel and other items going on last year in Q1. That will start to flip in the second half of the year and become a headwind. And the other area, I think that it's really important is, we've strategically staggered the timing and phase, the timing of our investments. And so those are to support our growth platform. So things like building out our digital platform, continuing to -- we just talked about the emerging markets. We're expanding our channel in the emerging markets. We're continuing to focus on localization. And so those investments will come in higher in the second half of the year. And I think the new thing is that inflation and -- has continued to tick up. And while we're taking pricing actions, they don't always perfectly offset from a timing perspective. And certainly, we're watching the supply chain constraints closely. Yes. So we've put a number of things in that bucket. And first of all, I need to give a shout out to the team because the performance in the first quarter was exceptional and stronger than what we had modeled. So we put things in there like our continuous improvement activities that take place in our manufacturing centers and within our supply chain. We also put our procurement negotiation upside that comes through productivity. That kind of offset some of the inflation headwinds that we're feeling as we're able to incorporate things like value engineering or better designs for existing products. Our restructuring savings were a contributor this quarter as well. That was about 100 basis points, purely restructuring and other structural cost savings, takeout was another 100, 150 basis points. So it's really a combination of a number of factors, and every -- all parts of it contributed this quarter. Yes. So thanks for the question, Connor. We're feeling -- it's something that we're watching closely, both from an inflation perspective and a shortage perspective. Particularly from a shortage perspective around resins and plastics, we think that the storm that took place earlier in the year in Texas put some pressure on the global -- on the supply chain. And our teams have been working at that, and I think they've been making good progress. And so when it comes to plastic shortages, we feel good about the supply that we've secured for the second quarter. And I think we're in a good place from a momentum perspective. Still work to do, but those are kind of resolving themselves in a favorable way. We're seeing inflation in copper, aluminum and steel. And that's an important part of why we've gone out with the second price increase in the second quarter. Yes. I think that hasn't changed. But when you incorporate the productivity that we're going to continue to drive out of our manufacturing sites and within our supply chain that will be on the positive side of that. No. I think if you look at what we implied through our guide, you'll see margin expansion in the second half compared to the first half. So we are -- I think we're off to a great start. And we're -- on a quarter -- on a sequential basis, you should see margin expansion in the second half as well. Yes. I think that's a good question. There have been some orders that have been placed to take advantage of pre-price, before the price increase takes effect. And so that's why what we've modeled is that we'll see greater price realization coming in Q3 and Q4 as we work through the existing orders that are in backlog. Yes. So first of all, with 25% year-over-year growth, there is definitely an uptick in demand. And so we can't dismiss. We think that there was some placement of orders a little bit earlier than normal because many, many companies are dealing with the supply chain constraints and shortages. And so customers want to get -- they want to be first in line to protect their supply. But net-net, very good performance. We're seeing good recovery on the industrial side. Residential remains strong. And commercial is starting to come back, particularly outside of the U.S. Yes. So if we look at Q1, what we're seeing is about 70 basis points from -- came from what we call continuous improvement. And that's hard work that takes place day after day in our manufacturing centers. And then our procurement organization delivered about 220 basis points of savings this quarter, which was a really good number. And so I think that's a high number. But net-net, this productivity element is a core part of our planned margin expansion for the year, and we're very glad to start seeing it right out of the gate. The -- our full year projection around productivity is right around 300 basis points. The first quarter was very strong. Yes. Thanks, Brian. Good question. I think from the orders growth, if we did not have supply chain constraints, we would have likely increased the guidance there because the large project deployments, which is a core part of our plan, are coming through in line with our expectations, and our customers are ready to go, which we're very, very encouraged about. But the situation on the electronics components is very, very dynamic. And so we want to continue to monitor and see how that plays out over the next few months. And we've taken extra inventory where it was possible. It takes a little bit of time to substitute parts out and get those certified, but that's something that our team is also working on. And I think we're not alone here. So I think this is well understood in the industry that there's a shortage of microchips. And so far, we've kept everything up and going, and we're going to keep fighting."

            "content": "Thanks, Matt. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We announced earlier this morning that our first quarter results reflect strong operational performance, exceeding our expectations on orders, revenue, margin and earnings per share. The quarter's growth was broad-based, reflecting increasing demand across all of our segments, our end markets and geographies. Our momentum coming into the year accelerated through the quarter, with the team taking full advantage of economic recovery and pent-up demand in our markets. Orders were up double digits in all 3 of our business segments, and backlog was up 23% organically. Both Western Europe and emerging markets delivered exceptional organic revenue growth, with Western Europe up 11% and emerging markets up 33% year-on-year, and with momentum up strong sequentially. U.S. demand also continued to recover with orders up 18%. Alongside top line growth, our results reflect considerable margin expansion. I credit the team's discipline, building on the benefit of volume effects and positive impact from the cost actions we took in 2020. Our financial position, which was robust coming into the quarter, strengthened even further on the combination of revenue growth and margin expansion. Looking forward, we are confident about the remainder of 2021 and beyond. Therefore, we are raising our full year guidance on the top line, margin and EPS. I'll talk a bit more shortly about trends and focus areas for the team. But first, let me hand it over to Sandy to provide more detail on performance in the quarter. Thanks, Sandy. I'd like to revisit the 3 focus areas we highlighted coming into the year: the performance of our growth platforms, the team's operational discipline and our progress on sustainability. Turning first to our growth platforms. You've already heard about our emerging markets teams exceptional first quarter performance with revenue and orders up 33% and 21%, respectively. Up until now, China and India have taken the spotlight. In both countries, our investments in capabilities and localization have created strong engines for sustainable growth. But of course, other areas of the emerging markets also represent great opportunity for us. Many countries in Eastern Europe, for example, continue to modernize their economies and represent a long runway of investment in Water Infrastructure. And in Africa, there are clearly big water challenges to solve as the higher growth nations continue to urbanize. We expect emerging markets overall will continue to be a source of healthy, sustainable growth for the foreseeable future. The second platform that continues to underpin sustainable growth is our digital strategy. Our broad portfolio enables us to combine multiple digital technologies into integrated offers, including AI-enabled software platforms, advanced communications networks and automated endpoints. Those capabilities have been key to our commercial momentum over the last several quarters with customer adoption of digital solutions accelerating through the pandemic. We've spoken previously about our headline wins in Texas and Ohio. In Q1, we added a large transformation project in Greensboro, North Carolina, and we have just signed another exciting deal to be announced in the next few weeks. All of these projects deliver network-as-a-service, software-as-a-service and advanced analytics. In each case, Xylem's ability to bring a suite of transformational capabilities distinguished us and was essential to winning. And just last week, we further extended the digital capabilities we can offer our customers by partnering with ESRI. ESRI is the global leader in geographic information systems, GIS for short. These systems are an essential component of utility's operating environment. By integrating their technology with our advanced digital solutions, water operators achieved unprecedented network visibility and a clear path to increased operational efficiency and sustainability. And with last week's agreement, Xylem and ESRI are bringing that powerful combination to the water sector together. Our partnership includes developing joint solution road maps and joint selling to water utilities around the world. We are very excited about this partnership and about the value we can deliver to customers together. Turning next to operating discipline. Our operational capabilities were absolutely key to coming through 2020 on strong foundations. As you know, last year, we made difficult but essential decisions on structural cost. And we're now clearly seeing the benefit of those actions. In addition, the team drove strong productivity gains in the first quarter, which offset the early impact of rising inflation. The result was solid margin expansion with incremental margins coming in at 55%. Over the last year, we've learned that we can do more with less, and we will remain absolutely vigilant on cost as economies reopen and demand continues to recover. That said, we are expecting some impact from the broad-based inflation and component supply challenges that are affecting the industrial and tech sectors. Now we've already taken action by strategically investing in inventory to support areas of strong demand, and we will continue driving productivity and pricing to mitigate inflation. Still, the supply environment is likely to remain challenging for some time. The third focus area we highlighted coming into the year was sustainability. I think many of us worried that the cause of sustainability might suffer setbacks through the economic hardships of 2020. However, instead of a retreat, we've actually seen a broad and energetic global embrace of sustainability. As an enterprise over the last year, we've taken several meaningful steps toward our Signature 2025 sustainability goals. We'll be those in our annual sustainability report to be published in June. We'll be reporting, for example, that in 2020, we helped our customers prevent 1.4 billion cubic meters of polluted water from entering local waterways. Now the report is largely retrospective, but of course, we continue to move forward. In 2021, we've deepened and broadened the link between compensation and sustainability performance. It is now a component in the long-term incentive program for a range of key executives. Our commitment and our action has put us in a leadership position, which is both gratifying and a tribute to the team. That said, we all know we have a lot more work ahead of us to deliver on our goals and on our mission and purpose. With that, I'll now hand it back over to Sandy to provide the forward view of our end markets, along with guidance for the remainder of the year. Thanks, Sandy. Xylem is clearly in a strong position coming out of Q1, and we expect this momentum to continue throughout the rest of the year and beyond. Demand recovery and strong commercial performance will drive organic growth. Operating discipline will deliver margin expansion and strong cash conversion. And a robust balance sheet will continue to underpin our strategy. More broadly, our business and mission have never been more relevant than they are today. The economic and social value of critical infrastructure is more apparent than ever. Not only it is critical in times of crisis, but also as a driver of economic recovery, and it's a prerequisite for broader prosperity. From the shocks of the last year, the world has embraced the need for greater resilience and the imperative of a sustainable future. In that context, our mission, our business and our values put us in a privileged position, which will enable us to continue creating both economic and social value for our stakeholders over the medium and long term. We look forward to providing an update on our strategy and long-term plans at our next Investor Day, which is currently planned for September 30. It will most likely be a combined virtual and physical format, but we do hope to host as many of you as possible COVID restrictions permitting. Matt and the team will follow up with more details as soon as they're pinned down. Now with that, we'd be happy to take any questions you may have. So operator, please lead us into Q&A. And Scott, from our past experience, the teams are doing rather good job on making sure the pricing sticks. So we get pretty good realization when we go out with these price increases. And I think the market is clearly expecting something from us and our competitors. And we saw -- Scott, to your question, it absolutely is being driven largely by sites opening up, not everywhere. But part of that is, again, the vaccine being distributed. I think part of it is just growing confidence in the part of the utilities to move forward with these projects. And that's also what drove our strong order growth and backlog growth in dewatering that we're seeing at this point in time is site access. And this is -- Dean, as you well know, this is happening across our sector, especially in the metrology piece of the business. But it's broad -- it's widespread across the sector. So it's not really creating any competitive pressure right now. It would be a matter of -- if we had shortage, things would move to the right in terms of installations, et cetera. So we're not seeing that as of yet. But it certainly -- if it's a risk, it would be a risk in the latter part of the year. Sure. Yes. So on the -- in terms of what problem are we trying to solve for here? Particularly with the utilities, we already had some of our businesses working with ESRI. That was our pipeline condition assessment business, the formalin is pure as well as was water, which does a lot of the kind of valve pipe replacement work for utilities. And so really building off of that long-term partnership, but really expanding now across the rest of our portfolio that is sold into the utility. So it really is about harnessing the power of the geographical data that ESRI has -- they've got a very large share base of utilities around the world. This is not limited to a U.S. opportunity. We think that the power of the collective. I know they are very, very excited about working with us because what they don't have right now -- we don't have access to the weather data they do. At the same time, they don't have the deep subject matter expertise of being able to advise the utility on how to use this data to go address pipeline issues or water treatment plan issues, whatever challenges that utility may be facing and that's what they're looking for us to really bring in. And they see it's the power and breadth of our portfolio since we're not limited on a few offerings in terms of equipment. The case study example of the 1 utility that we talked about in the Mid-Atlantic, we help them reduce their non-revenue water through a 4x reduction in pipe failures. And that 1 project is going to end up cutting their pipe replacement cost by $70 million. On the commercial side of the relationship, I'd rather not get into details on that right now. We can perhaps cover that maybe at our Investor Day later in the year. Yes, sure. Great question. I would say that -- you're right, part of the growth in Q1 is an easy comp, but we are expecting double-digit growth for the full year in China. It's really -- it's broad-based. It really is cutting across each one of our end markets. So it's not limited to treatment or transport or utilities even -- part of that is, again, there has been improvement in China in terms of side access, kind of an opening up more broadly of the economy. And so we see that investment flowing. From a long-term perspective, there really are -- we see a couple of key drivers here. The whole focus on sustainability and environmental impact by the central government there, which has been part of their long-range plan for a while now, is driving real investment, and we see that in our bidding pipeline and our project backlog. Secondly, it is really being driven also, from a competitive standpoint, by all of the work that we've done over the number of years to localize our supply chain as well as strengthening our engineering capabilities on the ground there and our selling capabilities. We've got a great team there, and we've got a quite strong brand name actually across China, especially on the utility side. Yes. We do a combination of structures. And these are not actually for us, large-scale investments that are required. So I wouldn't want to spook anybody on the call thinking that when we say we'd be using our balance sheet, that we're talking about something larger than what it actually is. These are rather small investments in a network that we can make. And it oftentimes happens when maybe there's a consortium of utilities where on their own they can't really afford it, they don't need to have it, dedicated to them. So we will make the investment, and we'll lease it back to them. It does address the affordability issues for the utility for the customer. But that's not the only model we do. I mean there are customers that literally make the investment themselves. And so, two different models there. I would say we're still in early-stage of scaling. And again, we'll have -- we have much more to share there in Investor Day in September. Yes. So obviously, we love all of our businesses. So I don't consider them being boring. But I know that's a bit tongue and shake on your part. The -- but if we think about our -- kind of our core businesses over the history of Xylem, we continue to invest organically in those businesses, and we've done some small tuck-in bolt-ons like in treatment, et cetera, as well. But we're increasing that investment in the second half of the year to where about 2/3 of the investment that we're going to be making in the second half is weighted towards kind of the core equipment product offerings that we need to do. The remainder really being in more the digital side. From an M&A standpoint, we are open. We evaluate opportunities across the spectrum for each one of our businesses in this segment because, hereby, it's really important that we maintain and extend our market share leadership in those businesses and not be purely fixated on just what's going on within M&CS. So that's a big theme across the company right now. In terms of the dynamics of slower ramp in top line growth and margin expansion in M&CS. I know we said this before, and you began to see that here in the first quarter. That really is a function of timing. I mean as these large deals begin to get deployed over the course of this year, second half and then next year and beyond, you're going to see that turn, especially when we look at it from an EBITDA standpoint relative to the rest of Xylem. Yes. It's a great question. And the answer right now is no one really knows because nothing has been approved yet. But I think directionally, as you well know, historically, CapEx in the U.S. water utility space, which is really what we're talking about is more on the CapEx side, has not been funded by federal legislation. And so if this pilot money comes through -- I mean quite frankly, on a relative basis, right now, the number is around $110 billion, I believe. That to me personally is underwhelming relative to the price tag of the rest of infrastructure was being kicked around. And so I think by the time you spread that out across the utilities in the states or at a local level, I don't think it's going to put as much pressure on utilities, as you pointed out. Moving away from otherwise progress they would be forced to make to protect their investments. So we'll see when we get there. That's not the rumbling that we're getting. I mean we stay close, for example, to NACA, which you will know is the North American Clean Water Association. And that's one of the questions we ask of those large utility players, is what do they think about the proposed bill? They're encouraged, but they're not making any plans based on it right now. I mean not at least widespread. And I think partly what we're really suggesting here is the uncertainty continues around the supply chain, in areas that -- it's moving around, and we've just gone out with price increases, and we have another one being rolled out. So we really want to see how that sticks and how that plays out as we get through Q2. And then we'll have a better view on the second half at that point. Sure. Matt, why don't you go through the numbers, and I'll talk about what we're seeing in terms of just momentum in the business. And we have -- I mean we still show it that from a reporting standpoint as AIA within the M&CS segment. But from a branding standpoint, we now refer a piece of that, which is the pure digital as Xylem view, which is our consultative business. And then we have the Pipeline Condition Assessment business, the artist formally known as Pure that's in there as well. So, those are two very different businesses, and they're now run separately. We saw nice momentum in both businesses. Matt can share the detailed numbers. But really good look at bidding activity on the digital side, order growth, backlog growth, margins, strong incremental margins on that business. So that team that we set up last year really is beginning to get some big traction now, not just with utilities in the U.S. but also across emerging markets in Europe. And I would say, Scott, it was those digital capabilities that were, in some cases, the distinguishing competitive advantage that really kind of helped get it across the finishing line. Yes, we have been -- I mean we have been working to qualify additional suppliers. But the predominant work that's been done is to work closely with our largest contract manufacturer, which is Flextronics. And obviously, with their large procurement capabilities in the mass procurement they do, we've got a really nice partnership with them, and we've been able to make sure at this point that we're getting our fair share of the components that are out there despite the shortage. And we just got to stay close to them and keep working that through the year. Yes. No, thanks. M&A is clearly an important piece of our long-term strategy, and so we continue to actively cultivate the pipeline. It is a very robust pipeline. It's very active. We would really be focused on further strengthening our digital platform, really diversifying some of our end market concentration. So as we said before, perhaps something in the industrial water space. And then, of course, as I mentioned earlier, always look at opportunities to strengthen our core. In terms of valuation, we have seen some multiple inflation there, but really tends to be around things in the digital space of scale. We've not been actively participating in some of those deals have been announced here recently because we like the portfolio that we've got. But we're always in the game on those in terms of looking at it. But we do want to be disciplined on valuation. What I would say is I acknowledge your comment and that is we've got a strong balance sheet, our equity is a valuable currency right now and both of those give us, we think, relative advantage to bring some of these differentiated assets into our portfolio. There is a reminder that we've got this $600 million note that's due in early Q4. So we -- that's not going to constrain us. But as you all are modeling cash and balance sheet, just make sure that you keep that in mind. Thank you. Well, thank you all for joining and for your continued interest and engagement here. Really appreciate the support. Look forward to seeing you again on our next earnings call, but also at our Investor Day, September 30. Matt and the team will be reaching out and coordinating with all of you to make sure that we get that scheduled for you. And so in the meantime, again, have a great remainder of your spring and summer. Stay safe. Stay well. And all the best of your families and colleagues. We'll see you soon."

Now please turn to Slide 4, and I'll turn the call over to our CEO, Patrick Decker.\nPatrick Decker: Thanks, Andrea, and good morning, everyone. As we indicated in our press release, the team delivered a very strong operational performance in the fourth quarter, exceeding our expectations across each segment and region. Resilient demand and strong backlog execution delivered 20% revenue growth for the quarter and healthy EBITDA margin expansion. That performance continued and built upon the team's solid delivery through the year, fueling healthy momentum coming into 2023. On a full year basis, revenue grew 11% and earnings per share grew 14%. Water Infrastructure grew 15% in the quarter on robust utilities and industrial demand in the U.S. and Western Europe, and the segment was up 12% for the full year. M&CS posted very strong fourth quarter performance. This segment was up 35% in the quarter on backlog execution from improved chip supply and continued strong demand, bringing full year growth to 8%. Applied Water grew 17% in the quarter and finished 2022 with 14% growth for the full year. Overall, higher volumes and positive price cost performance drove significant EBITDA margin expansion in the quarter, up 250 basis points versus the same period a year ago. The team delivered that growth and margin performance on continuing resilient demand globally. We saw healthy orders growth sequentially. And for the full year, orders were up 4%, demonstrating the durability of our business. I am so proud of the team's performance in serving our customers and of their commitment to our purpose, solving water. The global trends driving investment in water systems continue to intensify. And as today's results demonstrate, we are already very strongly positioned to address them. That said, our recent agreement to acquire Evoqua announced 2 weeks ago, will create a powerful platform to address the world's most critical water challenges with greater capability, depth and scale. We've begun the important work of integration planning to set the combined company up for success and are well into the process of seeking the necessary approvals. Until the deal closes, which we anticipate will be midyear, we remain focused on delivering results to the stakeholders we serve today. On that stand-alone basis, we see continuing resilient demand in our largest end markets, particularly utilities, despite the possibility of macroeconomic softness, Execution of our backlogs with ongoing price cost discipline, further supply chain improvements and a return to 100% free cash flow conversion. We expect that this will allow us to deliver 2023 organic revenue growth in the mid-single digits with solid EBITDA margin expansion, resulting in earnings per share between $3 and $3.25, up 10% versus last year at the midpoint of the range. We'll give more color on the outlook and guide in a moment, but first, I'll hand it over to Sandy to dig in briefly on the quarter's results before we look ahead at 2023.\nSandy Rowland: Thanks, Patrick. Please turn to Slide 5, and I'll cover our fourth quarter results. As Patrick highlighted, the team closed out a strong 2022 with another quarter of robust growth and margin expansion. Revenue grew 20% year-over-year, led by 26% growth in the U.S. and mid-teen growth in Western Europe and the emerging markets. In a moment, I'll give you a detailed performance by segment. But in short, utilities was up 24%, with strength in the U.S. driven by chip supply improvements in M&CS, and robust OpEx demand in Water Infrastructure. Industrial grew 15% on particularly strong demand in Western Europe and emerging markets and sustained strength in the U.S. Commercial was up 24%, mainly due to continued backlog execution in the U.S. and Western Europe. And residential was up 17%, driven by strength in emerging markets, partially offset by softness in the U.S. Compared to prior year, orders were down 3% in the quarter versus up 23% in the same period last year, but underlying demand remains resilient and in line sequentially. Water Infrastructure orders were up 13%, AWS down 6% and M&CS down 19%, following exceptionally high orders last year. However, M&CS orders were in line with the last quarter with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.1x. EBITDA margin was 18.7%, up 250 basis points from the prior year and up 40 basis points sequentially on strong volume and price, which more than offset inflation. Our EPS in the quarter was $0.92, up 46% year-over-year. Please turn to Slide 6, and I'll review the quarter's segment performance in a bit more detail. Water Infrastructure outperformed expectations with revenues up 15% in the quarter. Growth was robust across the portfolio, led by our wastewater utility business in the U.S. and industrial strength in emerging markets on continued dewatering demand. Geographically, the U.S. was up 26% with solid price realization on strong utilities OpEx demand and continued improvements in the supply chain. Foster Europe grew low double digits, driven by healthy industrial activity and emerging markets was also up low double digits, driven by dewatering demand in Latin America and Africa. Orders in the fourth quarter were up 13% with solid dewatering demand in emerging markets and continued utility strength in the U.S. EBITDA margin for the segment was up 80 basis points as price, net of inflation and volume conversion more than offset strategic investments. Please turn to Page 7. The Applied Water segment also exceeded expectations with fourth quarter revenues up 17% on strong price realization and backlog execution. Geographically, Western Europe was up over 20%, led by supply chain improvements and strong industrial and commercial demand. Emerging Markets was up mid-double digits on strong residential demand in the Middle East and India. The U.S. was up low double digits as supply chain improvements and price realization were partially offset by moderating residential volumes. Orders were down 6% in the quarter, with healthy industrial demand in the U.S. and Western Europe, offset by slowing U.S. residential orders. Segment EBITDA margin was up 270 basis points in the quarter. Margin expansion was driven by continued strong price realization, more than offsetting inflation and further supplemented by productivity savings. And now let's turn to Slide 8, and I'll cover our Measurement & Control Solutions business. M&CS revenue was up 35%, driven by recoveries in chip supply year-over-year and strong project execution in our test and measurement and pipeline assessment services businesses. Geographically, all regions were up more than 20%, led by U.S. growth of over 40%. M&CS orders were down 19% in the quarter, lapping a prior year compare of 28% orders growth during the peak of supply chain constraints. Demand for our AMI offering remains strong and our $2.1 billion backlog in M&CS is up 14% versus prior year. EBITDA margin for the segment was up 800 basis points versus the prior year and importantly, 130 basis points quarter sequentially. Strong volume conversion, coupled with price realization offsetting inflation, drove the expansion. And now let's turn to Slide 9 for an overview of cash flows and the company's financial position. In the fourth quarter, we generated free cash flow of $302 million. The team did a great job driving down working capital to hit our previous outlook of 80% free cash flow conversion for the year. While inventory remains elevated versus where we targeted to be longer term, as there still are pockets of the supply chain that necessitate the extra safety stock that we are carrying, our performance in Q4 gives us confidence in our path to return to 100% conversion in 2023. Our financial position remains robust as we exit the year with over $900 million in cash and available liquidity of $1.7 billion. And this is after paying down over $500 million of debt in December. Net debt-to-EBITDA leverage is 1.0x. Please turn to Slide 10, and I'll hand back to Patrick to look forward at 2023.\nPatrick Decker: Thanks, Sandy. The team did an excellent job delivering for our customers and communities in 2022. Their commitment and performance stood out during a tumultuous year of global economic and geopolitical uncertainty; lingering pandemic effects, especially in China; and a challenging supply chain environment. I'm very proud of everything the team achieved, and they are already carrying all that commercial momentum, operational discipline and resilience into 2023. As we look forward, we see continued healthy demand in our major markets despite the possibility of macroeconomic softness in certain sectors of the global economy. We expect that the essential nature of our solutions and the secular trends in water will continue to underpin demand in the attractive, stable end markets that we serve. And we expect to be even better able to serve that demand as supply chain friction continues to ease, and we can progressively work down our $3.6 billion backlogs. Looking ahead, we are advancing our strategic delivery of solutions to the acquisition of Evoqua. As I mentioned earlier, and as you would expect, until the deal closes, we are only providing organic guidance for Xylem on a stand-alone basis. But there's no doubt that the combination of Xylem's global utility scale and Evoqua's strength in attractive industrial end markets creates a powerful platform for growth. We expect significant revenue synergies in areas such as cross-selling of our respective utility and industrial portfolios in North America, and growing Evoqua's international exposure via Xylem's global channels and customer relationships. Now those are just 2 of the areas where we see tremendous potential to add to the growth of the combined companies and expand our value to customers globally, especially in a number of the most attractive water end markets. But it's not the only inorganic move we're making to give customers more of what they need most. We've also taken a big step forward in helping them adopt the digital solutions they need to increase the resilience of communities essential water infrastructure. In the shadow of our big announcement with Evoqua, another important partnership flew under the radar, one which will accelerate and enhance our ability to deliver more digital solutions to the utility customers around the world. Last quarter, we signed an exclusive commercial partnership with Idrica to make adoption of digital technologies easier, faster and more affordable for our utility customers. Headquartered in Valentia, Spain, Idrica is a leader in data management and analytics for water utilities. Idrica's GoAigua platform simplifies deployment and operation of new digital capabilities in any water utilities operations. It gives them one secure integrated interface that brings together data capture, analytics and asset and process management onto 1 platform. Having been born out of a utility operator itself, the platform has the advantage of having been built by utility for utilities, and it's already been deployed by over 300 customers around the world. Under the partnership, we will take a minority stake in Idrica and become the exclusive global distributor of their technology. Together, we will enable more utilities to harness the power of connected solutions. We're very excited about it, and we look forward to sharing more as the partnership progresses. We made one other important announcement recently. This one was just before the end of the year, appointing Matthew Pine as Chief Operating Officer. The move ensures that we have continuing focus on operational excellence from an enterprise perspective across all our business segments and regions to continue delivering on our commitment to faster-than-market revenue growth and margin expansion. At the same time, it's also freed up some of my capacity to deliver on Xylem's strategic evolution and capital deployment. In a moment, we'll turn the call back to Sandy for more detail on our guide. But first, I want to invite Matthew to say a few words on his key areas of focus in the new role and provide some color on our end market outlook. Matthew?\nMatthew Pine: Thanks, Patrick. We are very strongly positioned on intensifying trends with technology leadership in a large and growing installed base in attractive end markets. My focus as Chief Operating Officer is to further accelerate profitable growth and maximize the value we deliver to customers and communities around the world. Across the business, we continue to remove complexity, increase our local agility and unlock further scale efficiencies. This is all aimed, of course, at better serving our customers at the same time we deliver continuing margin expansion. We're driving this margin focus across the enterprise, taking particular aim at even more enhanced productivity and customer satisfaction. For example, in the M&CS segment, improvements in chip supply enabled us to build momentum, delivering the accretive backlog, we deploy resources back to productivity as well as new product introductions from innovation. Secondly, we continue to enhance our digital portfolio, as Patrick covered. Our customers need simple, integrated digital technologies that solve their problems cost effectively. Our portfolio increasingly meets that demand with attractive growth and margin profiles. Lastly, our customers depend on Xylem as a trusted partner to deliver ongoing support. So our third operational focus is in standardizing our solutions and creating new offerings. This will take us deeper into our installed base with aftermarket sales and services. New offerings such as outcome-based solutions and condition-based maintenance will enable us to capture demand, address customers' needs and expand reoccurring revenues. It's no accident that there's a theme running through all 3 of these priorities. Each is about growing revenues and improving our margins by serving our customers better, more thoroughly and more simply, making it even easier for them to do business with us and solve more of their challenges. When we talk about being in a privileged position, that's not mentally to refer to our strategic or market positioning. It also reflects our view that we are fortunate to work alongside the kind of customers that we do, partner with them to solve their critical water challenges they face. It's a privilege and also a great opportunity for continuing value creation from our shareholders, communities and all stakeholders. Now let's turn to Slide 11, and I'll walk you through our end market outlook. We expect underlying demand and most of our end markets will continue to be healthy through 2023. We've taken a balanced view based on the strength of our backlog, critical nature of our largest end markets, and the continued value proposition of our differentiated products. We anticipate our utility business overall, which is our largest end market, will grow high single digits in 2023.  On the wastewater side, we expect mid-single-digit growth as we see a continuation of steady global demand. We anticipate resilient OpEx demand in developed markets due to the critical nature of our offerings as well as the benefit of continued CapEx spend in emerging markets. The outlook for longer-term capital project spending and bid activity remains robust. On the clean water side, we anticipate revenues being up low teens. This growth is driven by continued robust demand for our AMI solutions and expected improvements in ship supply through 2023, allowing for significant large deal deployments already secured in our backlog. We foresee healthy momentum in our test and measurement and our pipeline assessment service businesses due to increased focus on infrastructure and climate challenges.  Looking at the industrial end market, we expect to go low to mid-single digits on steady demand for our solutions globally. We continue to see strong growth in dewatering due to mining demand in emerging markets and the benefits of our strategic investments in our U.S. and European dewatering business. The commercial end market should deliver low single-digit growth on solid replacement business and backlog execution, partially offset by moderation in new construction. In residential, our smallest end market, we are expecting low single-digit decline due to normalizing demand in the U.S., partially offset by continued strength in emerging markets. In both commercial and residential, we would expect moderation to emerge in the second half results as we continue to work through the backlog in the first half of 2023. Now I'll turn it over to Sandy to walk you through our updated guidance.\nSandy Rowland: Thank you, Matthew. Turning to Slide 12. As mentioned, we expect Evoqua to join us in mid-2023. We Until then, our full year guidance is on an organic basis and excludes the combination of the 2 companies. For Xylem overall, we foresee full year 2023 revenue growth in the range of 4% to 6%. This breaks down by segment as follows: mid-single-digit growth in Water Infrastructure with solid growth in both wastewater utilities and industrial; low single-digit growth in Applied Water from growth in industrial and commercial, partially offset by residential; We expect Measurement & Control Solutions to be up low teens. For 2023, we expect EBITDA to be in the range of 17.5% to 18%. This represents a 50 to 100 basis point margin expansion versus prior year. And this yields an EPS range of $3 to $3.25, up 10% at the midpoint over the prior year. Free cash flow conversion is expected to be 100% of net income. In addition, today, we announced an increase in our annual dividend of 10%, aligned with our capital allocation framework to grow dividends in line with earnings. We've also provided you with a number of other full year assumptions in the slide to supplement your models. We're assuming a euro-to-dollar conversion rate of 1.08 and a foreign exchange can be volatile, our FX sensitivity table is included in the appendix. And now drilling down on the first quarter, we anticipate total company revenues will be in the range of 7% to 9% growth. By segment, we expect high single-digit growth in Water Infrastructure, low single digits in Applied Water and high teens growth for M&CS. We expect first quarter EBITDA margin to be approximately 16%, driven by higher volumes and more favorable price cost dynamics.  And with that, please turn to Slide 13, and I'll turn the call back over to Patrick for closing comments.\nPatrick Decker: Thanks, Sandy. We're coming into 2023, very strongly positioned. Our end markets continue to show resilient underlying demand. We're confident in delivering mid-single-digit revenue growth and strong margin expansion and the team continues to outperform on strong operational and commercial execution. Beyond 2023, we remain well on track to deliver our longer-term strategic and financial milestones. We are very excited about all of the combination of Xylem and Evoqua will offer towards the creation of a more water secure, resilient and sustainable world, while driving value for our shareholders by accelerating growth and scale. The integration team met last week at our headquarters in D.C. The first of many meetings to set us up for success on day 1. And last week, I traveled with Ron Keating, Evoqua's CEO, to a number of their key sites to spend time with their incredibly talented people. Those visits only heighten my appreciation of the potential opportunities ahead and confirm the strong strategic and cultural fit of our 2 companies. We've also taken the next step in the regulatory process, having submitted the required filings here in the U.S. and progressing toward filings in the relevant international jurisdictions. We continue to anticipate the deal closing midyear A great deal of opportunity will open up when we bring our 2 companies together. During our next earnings call, we will provide an update on our progress. Meanwhile, our business remains squarely focused on delivering on our 2023 financial commitments and continuing our commercial momentum and execution.  Now operator, I'll turn the call back over to you for questions.\nOperator: We'll take our first question from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.\nDeane Dray: Strong finish to the year, both revenues and margins. And I just want to say congrats again on finally getting to the altar on Evoqua. This has made strategic sense for so long. And have a midyear target closing is lightning fast in our view. I know that there's a lot of heavy lifting. So best of luck.\nPatrick Decker: Thank you very much, Deane.\nDeane Dray: Can we start with M&CS margins? It sounds like the 2 drivers here, the chip supply improving, and this has been kind of a steady story for the past couple of quarters. How much have you worked through that backlog? And how much of the chip supply improvement contributed to the margin improvement in the segment? And then I've seen a nice shutout for pipeline assessment. Is this all pure and what's driving that?\nSandy Rowland: Yes, Deane, thanks for the question. Let me start, and Matt can add some color here. So we are very pleased with our Q4 performance in M&CS. The year has unfolded very much like we thought it would with continuing improvement in chip supply. The story in Q4 is actually a twofold story. We saw some upside compared to what we had forecast, and half of that upside came from some better chip supply. And the other half of the upside came from some of our other businesses in the portfolio that we don't talk as much about. So our pipeline assessment services business, a lot of projects were completed in Q4, really good results in our test and measurement business. And all of -- the entire portfolio across M&CS has good margin potential and good leverage. And so as we've got the top line going again, we're really encouraged that you're seeing that drop to the bottom line.\nMatthew Pine: Yes. I think the only thing I would add, Deane, is that we did pivot in Q4 to a more continuous improvement as we started to roll off of our product redesigns. So we saw a really good lift in Q4 and continuous improvement. And if you look at the price cost and the exit rate in Q4, it was really solid building momentum. This was -- if you recall, this was the last segment to really be impacted by inflation and really overcoming that in Q4, which also led to the margin improvement.\nDeane Dray: All sounds good. And just as a follow-up, I was hoping to get some more color on this announcement of the software platform investment at Idrica. If you listen to all of the trade shows and conferences, the biggest pain point for utilities is they get so much data, but none of it is connected, and it's all different formats. So this sounds really promising if it's one platform that then is able to integrate all of this. So some color on the pricing. Is this a SaaS business? Is it on-prem? Is it licensed? How will it fit in terms of the revenue stream? And you've got 300 customers now. What's the pipeline for new customers, new logos?\nPatrick Decker: Sure. So Deane, I'll just make a few comments, and I'll have Matthew go a little deeper because Matthew was part of the team that was integral to this courtship over the course of the past year or more. So he's well versed along with other team members on the opportunity here. But you're right, you said it best. It's the amalgamation of data coming from different data sources that we refer to as the power babble, with different languages, different code, and it makes it very difficult for the utility to optimize their overall network. So that's really what Idrica is getting at. They got a great platform already around the world, and our channels to utilities is really the big opportunity for them. But overlaying this solution to where effectively the way I described it, it's almost as they built the interoperable operating software on which our operating technologies will sit along with other apps that make it easier for the utility user to interface. But Matthew, do you want to talk a little bit about pricing and just the opportunity in the upside?\nMatthew Pine: Yes. So from a pricing point of view, Deane, really there's an implementation cost, obviously, to go implement the platform, which is a fee. And then it's really, to your point, a Software-as-a-Service. It's a subscription fee that's ongoing in some term is really the model that we've built. And just really amplifying your point, again, one of the biggest pain points we hear and we believe really this partnership will translate into really the digital adoption rates in the water sector. We see this as really being an aggregator in terms of bringing all these disparate systems together that Patrick mentioned. And our teams are engaged in building commercial momentum. We've implemented a few pilots that are starting to see great results from our collaboration already. But as we ramp through the year and build backlog, that will start to really unpack in Q4 and into '24.\nPatrick Decker: And I would clarify, Deane, that when we say pilots in this case, these are actual commercial arrangements that are revenue generating. It's not a pilot where we're going and testing something. So we've already had some very impressive potential wins there that we'll talk about in the, hopefully, the next quarter.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Joe Giordano with Cowen.\nJoe Giordano: So I just want to follow up on that Idrica stuff real quick and then move on. But is that something that utilities would put in, like, on top of what they already have? Or would it like more likely go like something that they would decide to move forward with like if they're putting in a new deployment?\nPatrick Decker: A lot of utilities don't have anything like this. So it's really on top of what they have, Joe, and it's integrating all their disparate systems, their SCADA systems, their PLC systems, their ERPs. Anything that's bringing data into their ecosystem gets consolidated into the platform with 1 dashboard and 1 interface. And if you think about a lot of the challenges of our utility customers and lots of different industrial customers in general, is they've got multiple applications, multiple passwords, all the information is siloed and they don't have a way to aggregate it. So this would come on as a layer to do that aggregation and give them a way to, as people say, democratize the data, be able to get the data to a user to make sense of all the information coming in.\nMatthew Pine: And Joe, just to add, what -- when we say it's built by utility for, utilities is that there are many other solutions that are out there, but they can tend to be quite complex and overly sophisticated. And this really allows them to design a solution that meets the utility where they are on the journey. Not every utility is of the same space or the same place in the journey as to how sophisticated the system needs to be. And so it could be tailored in that regard, but it's also a highly standardized platform. And that's part of the efficiency of their rollout is how easy it is to maintain.\nJoe Giordano: And then you guys were spending like a decent amount of resources kind of thinking about developing something like this internally at Xylem, if I'm correct. So now that you've made this decision here, which looks like it's already kind of packaged and ready to go for you, how do you reallocate the resources and what kind of impact does that have of not spending money trying to develop this internally?\nSandy Rowland: Yes. So I think that's a great question, Joe. There are certainly some overlaps between what we're spending money on from an R&D perspective. Just to remind you, the structure of the transaction is that it's a commercial agreement, which allows us to take the product and sell it on a global basis. And on top of that, we have a minority investment. And so there are certain things that we're going to keep going on our end. And then there are certain things that we're going to be able to leverage between the 2 companies. But there are certainly some synergies there. But really, this is a growth play.\nJoe Giordano: Okay. Just wanted to move to the 1Q guide here. Can you kind of talk a little bit about a bridge from maybe where we're exiting to where we are in 1Q? I'm trying to discern how much of this is being conservative versus how much is -- I guess it's early in the year and it's an uncertain year. Like if I look at, let's say, applied for example, or even M&CS. You're guiding applies basically up low single digits for the quarter and for the year. I would have thought that just given what's happening in resi, maybe it starts the year well above that and then finishes maybe flattish. So now you're kind of anticipating similar growth all year. Maybe talk us through that and M&CS, the guidance there kind of was what we expected heading in. But after the 4Q suggests like a 1Q step down off the 4Q run rate on revenue. So maybe talk us through that.\nSandy Rowland: Yes. Joe, I mean, there's a few things to unpack there. Let me start and the team here will remind me what else you asked. So look, there is some seasonality in our business. And if you look at it from a revenue perspective, we'll have a step down in revenue between Q4 and Q1. We always do. The biggest step down is actually in Water Infrastructure that has a big Q4. M&CS, there will be a little bit of a step down to. It's not so much in the metrology business, but some of the other businesses that we highlighted earlier on the call, our pipeline assessment services business, our test business, there's some seasonality there. So I think it's somewhere between $150 million and $200 million step down, Q4 to Q1. And that aligns with sort of our historical patterns. As we think about the year and the seasonality in the year, different businesses look a little bit different. Certainly, you touched on AWS, which is our most cyclical business when it comes to macro. And from an AWS perspective, we're entering the year with a very, very strong backlog. And so as we've modeled that business, we have modeled a stronger first half versus a stronger second half. The other businesses don't have quite as much seasonality built into the plan, other than in M&CS, we have been calling for a bigger ramp-up in the second half when some of the redesign work comes online and that coincide with better chip supply.\nPatrick Decker: So I would just add a couple of things, from a historical perspective, just to amplify what Sandy had said here. We are reflecting in our guide that backlog in AWS carries into the first half of the year, but we are forecasting softness in the second half. So obviously, that remains to be seen. Hopefully, things recover faster, and we kind of glide through this and don't get impacted by that. But right now, we're embedding our guide that there is softness that hits us in terms of conversion in the second half. Historically, Water Infrastructure has a bigger Q4 and slows down in Q1 because we're serving the wastewater side of utilities and they spend out their capital and OpEx budgets through the end of the fourth quarter and then they ramp up again in the following year. So just to give some context for those of you that may be new to the story.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Mike Halloran with Baird.\nMike Halloran : So just following up on that last little bit there. Patrick, you gave some context on the applied backlog. It seems like you're expecting normalization as you work through the year that it makes sense and it's a short-cycle business. Maybe some thoughts on how you're thinking about the backlog tracking for the other 2 segments? And if you think that there's a chance for normalization either of those as we move towards the end of the year towards a more consistent run rate or more consistent balance between how you think about orders and backlog and revenue conversion.\nSandy Rowland: Yes, Mike. I think we are already starting to see some normalization. If you look at the orders rate that we've had in the second half of the year, as -- particularly as the pockets where the supply chain has stabilized, we're seeing some of our customers there return to normal behaviors. I'd say Water Infrastructure is a great example of that. We've had a more stable supply chain there. And so that's where we've seen more normal order patterns, and we don't see a backlog that has been as elevated. We still have quite a bit of our backlog that's past due in M&CS, and we do expect to start eating into some of that in 2023. And I think that's a good thing because that means our projects are getting deployed.\nPatrick Decker: Go ahead, sorry.\nMatthew Pine: Yes. I was just going to build on the M&CS comment. We still have 30% of the backlog past due coming into the year. And so we'll still continue to monitor that as the chip supply continues sequentially to improve. That's something where we're looking at. But orders sequentially are good in that business, and we see good momentum going forward commercially.\nMike Halloran : Makes sense. And then on the kind of order side in the quoting pipeline side of things, obviously, orders taking the quarter not a surprise, given the comps, given some balancing out here. How do you think that the sequentials will work out through the year on the order side? What are the expectations there? And maybe any comments on how you're looking at the bidding pipeline as we sit here today in the areas where that's relevant?\nMatthew Pine: Yes. From a bidding pipeline standpoint, I would say, look, industrial remains really strong globally. We primarily play in the general industry. there, and that's been pretty resilient. So that continues strong. Commercial is a bit of -- it's showing strength, however, expected to be slow in the back half, primarily due to new construction moderating. We track the ABI Index, the architectural billing index, that's been less than 50 in the past 3 months. And so looking for a little bit of a slowdown in the bid activity for new construction for commercial. And we talked resi, that's primarily a replacement for us. the orders are slowing down, largely due to the improved supply chain. It's probably the biggest area that we've seen the supply chain improve and also from pandemic investments. And so that's really what's impacted that. And then a strong pipeline in M&CS, plus water infrastructure, especially treatment. We're starting to see treatment really ramp up and the net backlog also continues to build, and we have a strong funnel.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Nathan Jones with Stifel.\nNathan Jones : I think I'm going to go to questions and if I can get any answers around revenue synergies from the combination of Xylem and Evoqua. I mean this is clearly a growth-enabling deal, and Patrick, you highlighted a couple of avenues for that. Investors have been very hungry for information on what kind of value that might add. So is there any color on kind of what your targets are going to be in terms of the expected growth for the combined businesses, how you're going to approach it? Are you going to have specific growth teams assigned to these kinds of projects? Any color and more color you can give us around those kinds of things?\nPatrick Decker: Sure, sure. Yes. So as you've said, Nate, I mean -- so first of all, I mean, the economic returns of this combination are justified on the cost synergies alone. And I don't want to look past those because I want to make sure that our investors understand that we've got strong conviction around the $140 million of cost synergies within 3 years. Going forward, we will lay out exactly what the -- not only the 3 buckets are that we've talked about, and I can reiterate those if we need to, but specific delivery time frames, ownership, et cetera. So strong conviction around that cost synergy. Then beyond that, clearly, this combination is about growth. It really is taking a long-term view, not on the realization of synergies, but a long-term view on what the world needs right now in terms of a water company at scale and depth, and there are so many things that we can do together that we could not do as separate companies. Now on the revenue synergies I'm not going to give you a specific number as of yet. We clearly will do that, and I can talk a little bit about process. But clearly, we expect that there's going to be an accelerated growth rate of the combined company. And we will put a specific target out there as we get closer to finalization of this. In terms of the process, there is going to be a clear ownership within our integration work that's already kicked off. We have teams that have been assigned to go after each one of the several areas of gross synergy. Obviously, we have a view on that before we got the deal approved by both boards, but we're looking to see where there might even be other opportunities beyond that as we go forward. I laid out in my prepared remarks what some of those areas are. A few others that we did not highlight in my comments were around the combination of digital enablement in both companies. Evoqua is already doing a fair amount in digital enablement of their services, really focused on productivity and growth, and we continue to progress quite nicely in our digital enablement of more on the product side and the aftermarket service side. Last area is, we believe between Ron and I and the team that there is tremendous opportunity in the area of joint R&D, innovation and portfolio enhancement, whether that be organic or inorganic, given the complementary nature of the businesses. So that's what I can share with you right now, Nate. Obviously, we're as excited as you all are at being in a position to come out and share numbers around this, but we -- right now, we're focusing on getting the deal closed.\nNathan Jones : I have one follow-up question on a specific avenue of revenue synergies. Xylem historically been a product company and Evoqua developed this service-based model. Is there -- do you see the opportunity for you to implement new kinds of service-based business models on the legacy Xylem portfolio leveraging their service footprint?\nPatrick Decker: Yes, we certainly do. I mean it will take some time. That will not be a day 1 synergy and likely not even a year 1 synergy. But absolutely, we see bringing some elements of their best-in-breed service offerings. And quite frankly, just their -- the whole cultural model around services, we believe is going to be an enhancement to our more legacy traditional product-oriented aftermarket services that are out there. Two, they've already done a terrific work, and I realized that Ron would say they're still on that journey. And I certainly appreciated that last week whenever I spent a few days with him at multiple sites is that they're very much focused on outcome-based solutions. And so I think there's an opportunity there to enhance our business models and offerings whether that be both on the utility side but also on the industrial. There's -- as you know, Nate, there's a fair amount of complementary nature of pulling through there. They've got some terrific products within their APT business on the treatment side that complement what we do and vice versa, our treatment portfolio, enhancing what they can deliver in their industrial services offering.\nNathan Jones : Yes, it seems to be a lot of avenues for growth there. So I look forward to hearing more about it over the next few months and few quarters.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Scott Davis with Melius Research.\nScott Davis : Every -- just a couple -- one kind of point of clarification then a real question. But are you still raising price here and now that we're into '23 or the price increases you did in '22 pretty much enough to offset your inflation.\nMatthew Pine: Yes. We did -- Scott, we did the last round of price increases back in November of 2022. So really, the price increase, in essence would be for '23 kind of heading into this year. So obviously, we're continuing to watch the marketplace and understand not only the inflationary environment and how that continues on. It really -- it's moderated some, but it's still up and also just also make sure we're monitoring our win-loss rate in the marketplace and making sure that we're appropriately priced accordingly in the market.\nScott Davis : All right. Helpful. And then I think about 2022, so much of the year, not just you guys, but most companies were held hostage by the chip makers. And how -- where do you guys see yourselves going forward and kind of redundancy or flexibility or whatever other words that we want to use to kind of describe it just to make sure that this chip issue doesn't come back every time there's some sort of dislocation that design is more perspective in the future?\nPatrick Decker: Sure. Scott, this is Patrick. So I'd say, first of all, we, by no means, are out of the woods on this yet, even though we've seen sequential improvement. I would say that the health, all the discussions that we have with both the chip suppliers themselves and our intermediaries all have stabilized and strengthened. Clearly, I know people are looking at auto right now and hearing about weakness there and wondering whether or not all of a sudden, we're going to get a boat load of chips that show up. It just doesn't work that way in terms of the allocation. We continue -- the substitutes aren't easy in this space. And so the main thing we did, as Matthew alluded to earlier, was we spent a lot of time and energy and quite frankly, money this past year, redesigning our offerings to get to the next generation. So we could be best in line. I do think that as other sectors perhaps show slowness that will simply further strengthen the recovery for us, but we're not counting on that right now or baking that into our outlook for the year.\nScott Davis : That\u2019s helpful, Patrick. Just to be clear, so when you talk about redesigning, are you talking about going to a chip design that\u2019s more ubiquitous and more commonly used in consumer electronics? Or is there some sort of level in between where you\u2019re at from that next-gen chip?\nA \u2013Patrick Decker: It\u2019s just really getting to next-gen chips, where the capacity is being allocated are being built so we have more capacity for the future, yes, because we\u2019re on legacy designs that they\u2019re bringing down the capacity on those chips.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Patrick or Matt, I know you've talked about forecasting a slower second half in Applied Water, especially as new construction potentially sows in commercial. But have you begun to see any evidence of channel destocking or other customer behavior that concerns you in commercial markets? And then separately, have you put in any contingency in your guide for China reopening related noise? It looks like China was still strong for you in Q4?\nMatthew Pine: Yes. So Andy, on the first one on channel inventory. We have really good visibility into the inventory given our relationship with our channel partners. The teams we meet monthly and actually quarterly with counsel meetings in addition to weekly sales calls in contact. So we have really good insight into the inventory. The levels are healthy and normalizing and they're not sitting on any excess inventory, which is reported back to us. There are some pockets that have not fully recovered. Commercial is not back to kind of prepandemic levels in terms of inventory. But resi, I would say, is normalized due to the improved supply chain and softening from the pandemic investments. On the industrial front, that's really more of an engineer-to-order product. There's not a lot of build to stock. And so that's where I'd leave it on the channel inventory there.\nSandy Rowland: Andy, let me take the China part of your question. So China was tough for us this year. We were down in China about 20% in the first half of the year. We saw a moderation in the second half -- and as we -- a little bit stronger Q3 than Q4 given the outbreak of COVID in Q4. And I think we've taken a measured approach to China and our guide for 2023. We do expect more of a recovery in the second half of the year in China. The slowdown has been more acute more on the utility side of the business, and we've seen stronger performance on the industrial side. And so our focus for our team is building orders momentum again. And we remain very bullish long term on China. We're just working through some of the dynamics there now.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Appreciate that, Sandy. And then it seems like industrial dewatering continues to hold up well as it does tend to be more historically cyclical, but could the business be much less cyclical during the current cycle given the amount of activity that's out there. I know you mentioned mining. Maybe you could comment on the support you're getting from your strategic growth investments as well, what exactly you're doing there?\nMatthew Pine: Yes. We made a constant effort back a few years ago to be a bit more balanced in our segmentation of that business, especially shifting more to the muni side, which is a bit more stable. And we've seen that part of the portfolio grow and also just making investments in our fleet and upgrading our technology. We are digitizing those assets and making those remotely connectable so we can improve the productivity for our customers. So it's a mixed bag of really, I'd say, some innovation as well as being thoughtful about being more balanced in the segmentation of the business.\nOperator: It appears that we have no further questions at this time. I will now turn the program back over to Patrick Decker for any additional or closing remarks.\nPatrick Decker: Thank you. So again, thanks, everybody, for your time today. I know you're all very, very busy at this time of the year. Really appreciate your ongoing continued interest in Xylem. I very much look forward to providing you updates on our progress around the Evoqua transaction. And between now and then, safe travels, everyone and all the very best. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's Xylem fourth quarter and full year 2022 earnings conference call. Please disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Sandy Rowland",
            "content": "Thanks, Patrick. Please turn to Slide 5, and I'll cover our fourth quarter results. As Patrick highlighted, the team closed out a strong 2022 with another quarter of robust growth and margin expansion. Revenue grew 20% year-over-year, led by 26% growth in the U.S. and mid-teen growth in Western Europe and the emerging markets. In a moment, I'll give you a detailed performance by segment. But in short, utilities was up 24%, with strength in the U.S. driven by chip supply improvements in M&CS, and robust OpEx demand in Water Infrastructure. Industrial grew 15% on particularly strong demand in Western Europe and emerging markets and sustained strength in the U.S. Commercial was up 24%, mainly due to continued backlog execution in the U.S. and Western Europe. And residential was up 17%, driven by strength in emerging markets, partially offset by softness in the U.S. Compared to prior year, orders were down 3% in the quarter versus up 23% in the same period last year, but underlying demand remains resilient and in line sequentially. Water Infrastructure orders were up 13%, AWS down 6% and M&CS down 19%, following exceptionally high orders last year. However, M&CS orders were in line with the last quarter with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.1x. EBITDA margin was 18.7%, up 250 basis points from the prior year and up 40 basis points sequentially on strong volume and price, which more than offset inflation. Our EPS in the quarter was $0.92, up 46% year-over-year. Please turn to Slide 6, and I'll review the quarter's segment performance in a bit more detail. Water Infrastructure outperformed expectations with revenues up 15% in the quarter. Growth was robust across the portfolio, led by our wastewater utility business in the U.S. and industrial strength in emerging markets on continued dewatering demand. Geographically, the U.S. was up 26% with solid price realization on strong utilities OpEx demand and continued improvements in the supply chain. Foster Europe grew low double digits, driven by healthy industrial activity and emerging markets was also up low double digits, driven by dewatering demand in Latin America and Africa. Orders in the fourth quarter were up 13% with solid dewatering demand in emerging markets and continued utility strength in the U.S. EBITDA margin for the segment was up 80 basis points as price, net of inflation and volume conversion more than offset strategic investments. Please turn to Page 7. The Applied Water segment also exceeded expectations with fourth quarter revenues up 17% on strong price realization and backlog execution. Geographically, Western Europe was up over 20%, led by supply chain improvements and strong industrial and commercial demand. Emerging Markets was up mid-double digits on strong residential demand in the Middle East and India. The U.S. was up low double digits as supply chain improvements and price realization were partially offset by moderating residential volumes. Orders were down 6% in the quarter, with healthy industrial demand in the U.S. and Western Europe, offset by slowing U.S. residential orders. Segment EBITDA margin was up 270 basis points in the quarter. Margin expansion was driven by continued strong price realization, more than offsetting inflation and further supplemented by productivity savings. And now let's turn to Slide 8, and I'll cover our Measurement & Control Solutions business. M&CS revenue was up 35%, driven by recoveries in chip supply year-over-year and strong project execution in our test and measurement and pipeline assessment services businesses. Geographically, all regions were up more than 20%, led by U.S. growth of over 40%. M&CS orders were down 19% in the quarter, lapping a prior year compare of 28% orders growth during the peak of supply chain constraints. Demand for our AMI offering remains strong and our $2.1 billion backlog in M&CS is up 14% versus prior year. EBITDA margin for the segment was up 800 basis points versus the prior year and importantly, 130 basis points quarter sequentially. Strong volume conversion, coupled with price realization offsetting inflation, drove the expansion. And now let's turn to Slide 9 for an overview of cash flows and the company's financial position. In the fourth quarter, we generated free cash flow of $302 million. The team did a great job driving down working capital to hit our previous outlook of 80% free cash flow conversion for the year. While inventory remains elevated versus where we targeted to be longer term, as there still are pockets of the supply chain that necessitate the extra safety stock that we are carrying, our performance in Q4 gives us confidence in our path to return to 100% conversion in 2023. Our financial position remains robust as we exit the year with over $900 million in cash and available liquidity of $1.7 billion. And this is after paying down over $500 million of debt in December. Net debt-to-EBITDA leverage is 1.0x. Please turn to Slide 10, and I'll hand back to Patrick to look forward at 2023. Thank you, Matthew. Turning to Slide 12. As mentioned, we expect Evoqua to join us in mid-2023. We Until then, our full year guidance is on an organic basis and excludes the combination of the 2 companies. For Xylem overall, we foresee full year 2023 revenue growth in the range of 4% to 6%. This breaks down by segment as follows: mid-single-digit growth in Water Infrastructure with solid growth in both wastewater utilities and industrial; low single-digit growth in Applied Water from growth in industrial and commercial, partially offset by residential; We expect Measurement & Control Solutions to be up low teens. For 2023, we expect EBITDA to be in the range of 17.5% to 18%. This represents a 50 to 100 basis point margin expansion versus prior year. And this yields an EPS range of $3 to $3.25, up 10% at the midpoint over the prior year. Free cash flow conversion is expected to be 100% of net income. In addition, today, we announced an increase in our annual dividend of 10%, aligned with our capital allocation framework to grow dividends in line with earnings. We've also provided you with a number of other full year assumptions in the slide to supplement your models. We're assuming a euro-to-dollar conversion rate of 1.08 and a foreign exchange can be volatile, our FX sensitivity table is included in the appendix. And now drilling down on the first quarter, we anticipate total company revenues will be in the range of 7% to 9% growth. By segment, we expect high single-digit growth in Water Infrastructure, low single digits in Applied Water and high teens growth for M&CS. We expect first quarter EBITDA margin to be approximately 16%, driven by higher volumes and more favorable price cost dynamics.  And with that, please turn to Slide 13, and I'll turn the call back over to Patrick for closing comments. Yes, Deane, thanks for the question. Let me start, and Matt can add some color here. So we are very pleased with our Q4 performance in M&CS. The year has unfolded very much like we thought it would with continuing improvement in chip supply. The story in Q4 is actually a twofold story. We saw some upside compared to what we had forecast, and half of that upside came from some better chip supply. And the other half of the upside came from some of our other businesses in the portfolio that we don't talk as much about. So our pipeline assessment services business, a lot of projects were completed in Q4, really good results in our test and measurement business. And all of -- the entire portfolio across M&CS has good margin potential and good leverage. And so as we've got the top line going again, we're really encouraged that you're seeing that drop to the bottom line. Yes. So I think that's a great question, Joe. There are certainly some overlaps between what we're spending money on from an R&D perspective. Just to remind you, the structure of the transaction is that it's a commercial agreement, which allows us to take the product and sell it on a global basis. And on top of that, we have a minority investment. And so there are certain things that we're going to keep going on our end. And then there are certain things that we're going to be able to leverage between the 2 companies. But there are certainly some synergies there. But really, this is a growth play. Yes. Joe, I mean, there's a few things to unpack there. Let me start and the team here will remind me what else you asked. So look, there is some seasonality in our business. And if you look at it from a revenue perspective, we'll have a step down in revenue between Q4 and Q1. We always do. The biggest step down is actually in Water Infrastructure that has a big Q4. M&CS, there will be a little bit of a step down to. It's not so much in the metrology business, but some of the other businesses that we highlighted earlier on the call, our pipeline assessment services business, our test business, there's some seasonality there. So I think it's somewhere between $150 million and $200 million step down, Q4 to Q1. And that aligns with sort of our historical patterns. As we think about the year and the seasonality in the year, different businesses look a little bit different. Certainly, you touched on AWS, which is our most cyclical business when it comes to macro. And from an AWS perspective, we're entering the year with a very, very strong backlog. And so as we've modeled that business, we have modeled a stronger first half versus a stronger second half. The other businesses don't have quite as much seasonality built into the plan, other than in M&CS, we have been calling for a bigger ramp-up in the second half when some of the redesign work comes online and that coincide with better chip supply. Yes, Mike. I think we are already starting to see some normalization. If you look at the orders rate that we've had in the second half of the year, as -- particularly as the pockets where the supply chain has stabilized, we're seeing some of our customers there return to normal behaviors. I'd say Water Infrastructure is a great example of that. We've had a more stable supply chain there. And so that's where we've seen more normal order patterns, and we don't see a backlog that has been as elevated. We still have quite a bit of our backlog that's past due in M&CS, and we do expect to start eating into some of that in 2023. And I think that's a good thing because that means our projects are getting deployed. Andy, let me take the China part of your question. So China was tough for us this year. We were down in China about 20% in the first half of the year. We saw a moderation in the second half -- and as we -- a little bit stronger Q3 than Q4 given the outbreak of COVID in Q4. And I think we've taken a measured approach to China and our guide for 2023. We do expect more of a recovery in the second half of the year in China. The slowdown has been more acute more on the utility side of the business, and we've seen stronger performance on the industrial side. And so our focus for our team is building orders momentum again. And we remain very bullish long term on China. We're just working through some of the dynamics there now."

            "name": "Patrick Decker",
            "content": "Thanks, Andrea, and good morning, everyone. As we indicated in our press release, the team delivered a very strong operational performance in the fourth quarter, exceeding our expectations across each segment and region. Resilient demand and strong backlog execution delivered 20% revenue growth for the quarter and healthy EBITDA margin expansion. That performance continued and built upon the team's solid delivery through the year, fueling healthy momentum coming into 2023. On a full year basis, revenue grew 11% and earnings per share grew 14%. Water Infrastructure grew 15% in the quarter on robust utilities and industrial demand in the U.S. and Western Europe, and the segment was up 12% for the full year. M&CS posted very strong fourth quarter performance. This segment was up 35% in the quarter on backlog execution from improved chip supply and continued strong demand, bringing full year growth to 8%. Applied Water grew 17% in the quarter and finished 2022 with 14% growth for the full year. Overall, higher volumes and positive price cost performance drove significant EBITDA margin expansion in the quarter, up 250 basis points versus the same period a year ago. The team delivered that growth and margin performance on continuing resilient demand globally. We saw healthy orders growth sequentially. And for the full year, orders were up 4%, demonstrating the durability of our business. I am so proud of the team's performance in serving our customers and of their commitment to our purpose, solving water. The global trends driving investment in water systems continue to intensify. And as today's results demonstrate, we are already very strongly positioned to address them. That said, our recent agreement to acquire Evoqua announced 2 weeks ago, will create a powerful platform to address the world's most critical water challenges with greater capability, depth and scale. We've begun the important work of integration planning to set the combined company up for success and are well into the process of seeking the necessary approvals. Until the deal closes, which we anticipate will be midyear, we remain focused on delivering results to the stakeholders we serve today. On that stand-alone basis, we see continuing resilient demand in our largest end markets, particularly utilities, despite the possibility of macroeconomic softness, Execution of our backlogs with ongoing price cost discipline, further supply chain improvements and a return to 100% free cash flow conversion. We expect that this will allow us to deliver 2023 organic revenue growth in the mid-single digits with solid EBITDA margin expansion, resulting in earnings per share between $3 and $3.25, up 10% versus last year at the midpoint of the range. We'll give more color on the outlook and guide in a moment, but first, I'll hand it over to Sandy to dig in briefly on the quarter's results before we look ahead at 2023. Thanks, Sandy. The team did an excellent job delivering for our customers and communities in 2022. Their commitment and performance stood out during a tumultuous year of global economic and geopolitical uncertainty; lingering pandemic effects, especially in China; and a challenging supply chain environment. I'm very proud of everything the team achieved, and they are already carrying all that commercial momentum, operational discipline and resilience into 2023. As we look forward, we see continued healthy demand in our major markets despite the possibility of macroeconomic softness in certain sectors of the global economy. We expect that the essential nature of our solutions and the secular trends in water will continue to underpin demand in the attractive, stable end markets that we serve. And we expect to be even better able to serve that demand as supply chain friction continues to ease, and we can progressively work down our $3.6 billion backlogs. Looking ahead, we are advancing our strategic delivery of solutions to the acquisition of Evoqua. As I mentioned earlier, and as you would expect, until the deal closes, we are only providing organic guidance for Xylem on a stand-alone basis. But there's no doubt that the combination of Xylem's global utility scale and Evoqua's strength in attractive industrial end markets creates a powerful platform for growth. We expect significant revenue synergies in areas such as cross-selling of our respective utility and industrial portfolios in North America, and growing Evoqua's international exposure via Xylem's global channels and customer relationships. Now those are just 2 of the areas where we see tremendous potential to add to the growth of the combined companies and expand our value to customers globally, especially in a number of the most attractive water end markets. But it's not the only inorganic move we're making to give customers more of what they need most. We've also taken a big step forward in helping them adopt the digital solutions they need to increase the resilience of communities essential water infrastructure. In the shadow of our big announcement with Evoqua, another important partnership flew under the radar, one which will accelerate and enhance our ability to deliver more digital solutions to the utility customers around the world. Last quarter, we signed an exclusive commercial partnership with Idrica to make adoption of digital technologies easier, faster and more affordable for our utility customers. Headquartered in Valentia, Spain, Idrica is a leader in data management and analytics for water utilities. Idrica's GoAigua platform simplifies deployment and operation of new digital capabilities in any water utilities operations. It gives them one secure integrated interface that brings together data capture, analytics and asset and process management onto 1 platform. Having been born out of a utility operator itself, the platform has the advantage of having been built by utility for utilities, and it's already been deployed by over 300 customers around the world. Under the partnership, we will take a minority stake in Idrica and become the exclusive global distributor of their technology. Together, we will enable more utilities to harness the power of connected solutions. We're very excited about it, and we look forward to sharing more as the partnership progresses. We made one other important announcement recently. This one was just before the end of the year, appointing Matthew Pine as Chief Operating Officer. The move ensures that we have continuing focus on operational excellence from an enterprise perspective across all our business segments and regions to continue delivering on our commitment to faster-than-market revenue growth and margin expansion. At the same time, it's also freed up some of my capacity to deliver on Xylem's strategic evolution and capital deployment. In a moment, we'll turn the call back to Sandy for more detail on our guide. But first, I want to invite Matthew to say a few words on his key areas of focus in the new role and provide some color on our end market outlook. Matthew? Thanks, Sandy. We're coming into 2023, very strongly positioned. Our end markets continue to show resilient underlying demand. We're confident in delivering mid-single-digit revenue growth and strong margin expansion and the team continues to outperform on strong operational and commercial execution. Beyond 2023, we remain well on track to deliver our longer-term strategic and financial milestones. We are very excited about all of the combination of Xylem and Evoqua will offer towards the creation of a more water secure, resilient and sustainable world, while driving value for our shareholders by accelerating growth and scale. The integration team met last week at our headquarters in D.C. The first of many meetings to set us up for success on day 1. And last week, I traveled with Ron Keating, Evoqua's CEO, to a number of their key sites to spend time with their incredibly talented people. Those visits only heighten my appreciation of the potential opportunities ahead and confirm the strong strategic and cultural fit of our 2 companies. We've also taken the next step in the regulatory process, having submitted the required filings here in the U.S. and progressing toward filings in the relevant international jurisdictions. We continue to anticipate the deal closing midyear A great deal of opportunity will open up when we bring our 2 companies together. During our next earnings call, we will provide an update on our progress. Meanwhile, our business remains squarely focused on delivering on our 2023 financial commitments and continuing our commercial momentum and execution.  Now operator, I'll turn the call back over to you for questions. Thank you very much, Deane. Sure. So Deane, I'll just make a few comments, and I'll have Matthew go a little deeper because Matthew was part of the team that was integral to this courtship over the course of the past year or more. So he's well versed along with other team members on the opportunity here. But you're right, you said it best. It's the amalgamation of data coming from different data sources that we refer to as the power babble, with different languages, different code, and it makes it very difficult for the utility to optimize their overall network. So that's really what Idrica is getting at. They got a great platform already around the world, and our channels to utilities is really the big opportunity for them. But overlaying this solution to where effectively the way I described it, it's almost as they built the interoperable operating software on which our operating technologies will sit along with other apps that make it easier for the utility user to interface. But Matthew, do you want to talk a little bit about pricing and just the opportunity in the upside? And I would clarify, Deane, that when we say pilots in this case, these are actual commercial arrangements that are revenue generating. It's not a pilot where we're going and testing something. So we've already had some very impressive potential wins there that we'll talk about in the, hopefully, the next quarter. A lot of utilities don't have anything like this. So it's really on top of what they have, Joe, and it's integrating all their disparate systems, their SCADA systems, their PLC systems, their ERPs. Anything that's bringing data into their ecosystem gets consolidated into the platform with 1 dashboard and 1 interface. And if you think about a lot of the challenges of our utility customers and lots of different industrial customers in general, is they've got multiple applications, multiple passwords, all the information is siloed and they don't have a way to aggregate it. So this would come on as a layer to do that aggregation and give them a way to, as people say, democratize the data, be able to get the data to a user to make sense of all the information coming in. So I would just add a couple of things, from a historical perspective, just to amplify what Sandy had said here. We are reflecting in our guide that backlog in AWS carries into the first half of the year, but we are forecasting softness in the second half. So obviously, that remains to be seen. Hopefully, things recover faster, and we kind of glide through this and don't get impacted by that. But right now, we're embedding our guide that there is softness that hits us in terms of conversion in the second half. Historically, Water Infrastructure has a bigger Q4 and slows down in Q1 because we're serving the wastewater side of utilities and they spend out their capital and OpEx budgets through the end of the fourth quarter and then they ramp up again in the following year. So just to give some context for those of you that may be new to the story. Go ahead, sorry. Sure, sure. Yes. So as you've said, Nate, I mean -- so first of all, I mean, the economic returns of this combination are justified on the cost synergies alone. And I don't want to look past those because I want to make sure that our investors understand that we've got strong conviction around the $140 million of cost synergies within 3 years. Going forward, we will lay out exactly what the -- not only the 3 buckets are that we've talked about, and I can reiterate those if we need to, but specific delivery time frames, ownership, et cetera. So strong conviction around that cost synergy. Then beyond that, clearly, this combination is about growth. It really is taking a long-term view, not on the realization of synergies, but a long-term view on what the world needs right now in terms of a water company at scale and depth, and there are so many things that we can do together that we could not do as separate companies. Now on the revenue synergies I'm not going to give you a specific number as of yet. We clearly will do that, and I can talk a little bit about process. But clearly, we expect that there's going to be an accelerated growth rate of the combined company. And we will put a specific target out there as we get closer to finalization of this. In terms of the process, there is going to be a clear ownership within our integration work that's already kicked off. We have teams that have been assigned to go after each one of the several areas of gross synergy. Obviously, we have a view on that before we got the deal approved by both boards, but we're looking to see where there might even be other opportunities beyond that as we go forward. I laid out in my prepared remarks what some of those areas are. A few others that we did not highlight in my comments were around the combination of digital enablement in both companies. Evoqua is already doing a fair amount in digital enablement of their services, really focused on productivity and growth, and we continue to progress quite nicely in our digital enablement of more on the product side and the aftermarket service side. Last area is, we believe between Ron and I and the team that there is tremendous opportunity in the area of joint R&D, innovation and portfolio enhancement, whether that be organic or inorganic, given the complementary nature of the businesses. So that's what I can share with you right now, Nate. Obviously, we're as excited as you all are at being in a position to come out and share numbers around this, but we -- right now, we're focusing on getting the deal closed. Yes, we certainly do. I mean it will take some time. That will not be a day 1 synergy and likely not even a year 1 synergy. But absolutely, we see bringing some elements of their best-in-breed service offerings. And quite frankly, just their -- the whole cultural model around services, we believe is going to be an enhancement to our more legacy traditional product-oriented aftermarket services that are out there. Two, they've already done a terrific work, and I realized that Ron would say they're still on that journey. And I certainly appreciated that last week whenever I spent a few days with him at multiple sites is that they're very much focused on outcome-based solutions. And so I think there's an opportunity there to enhance our business models and offerings whether that be both on the utility side but also on the industrial. There's -- as you know, Nate, there's a fair amount of complementary nature of pulling through there. They've got some terrific products within their APT business on the treatment side that complement what we do and vice versa, our treatment portfolio, enhancing what they can deliver in their industrial services offering. Sure. Scott, this is Patrick. So I'd say, first of all, we, by no means, are out of the woods on this yet, even though we've seen sequential improvement. I would say that the health, all the discussions that we have with both the chip suppliers themselves and our intermediaries all have stabilized and strengthened. Clearly, I know people are looking at auto right now and hearing about weakness there and wondering whether or not all of a sudden, we're going to get a boat load of chips that show up. It just doesn't work that way in terms of the allocation. We continue -- the substitutes aren't easy in this space. And so the main thing we did, as Matthew alluded to earlier, was we spent a lot of time and energy and quite frankly, money this past year, redesigning our offerings to get to the next generation. So we could be best in line. I do think that as other sectors perhaps show slowness that will simply further strengthen the recovery for us, but we're not counting on that right now or baking that into our outlook for the year. Thank you. So again, thanks, everybody, for your time today. I know you're all very, very busy at this time of the year. Really appreciate your ongoing continued interest in Xylem. I very much look forward to providing you updates on our progress around the Evoqua transaction. And between now and then, safe travels, everyone and all the very best. Thank you."

            "content": "Thanks, Patrick. We are very strongly positioned on intensifying trends with technology leadership in a large and growing installed base in attractive end markets. My focus as Chief Operating Officer is to further accelerate profitable growth and maximize the value we deliver to customers and communities around the world. Across the business, we continue to remove complexity, increase our local agility and unlock further scale efficiencies. This is all aimed, of course, at better serving our customers at the same time we deliver continuing margin expansion. We're driving this margin focus across the enterprise, taking particular aim at even more enhanced productivity and customer satisfaction. For example, in the M&CS segment, improvements in chip supply enabled us to build momentum, delivering the accretive backlog, we deploy resources back to productivity as well as new product introductions from innovation. Secondly, we continue to enhance our digital portfolio, as Patrick covered. Our customers need simple, integrated digital technologies that solve their problems cost effectively. Our portfolio increasingly meets that demand with attractive growth and margin profiles. Lastly, our customers depend on Xylem as a trusted partner to deliver ongoing support. So our third operational focus is in standardizing our solutions and creating new offerings. This will take us deeper into our installed base with aftermarket sales and services. New offerings such as outcome-based solutions and condition-based maintenance will enable us to capture demand, address customers' needs and expand reoccurring revenues. It's no accident that there's a theme running through all 3 of these priorities. Each is about growing revenues and improving our margins by serving our customers better, more thoroughly and more simply, making it even easier for them to do business with us and solve more of their challenges. When we talk about being in a privileged position, that's not mentally to refer to our strategic or market positioning. It also reflects our view that we are fortunate to work alongside the kind of customers that we do, partner with them to solve their critical water challenges they face. It's a privilege and also a great opportunity for continuing value creation from our shareholders, communities and all stakeholders. Now let's turn to Slide 11, and I'll walk you through our end market outlook. We expect underlying demand and most of our end markets will continue to be healthy through 2023. We've taken a balanced view based on the strength of our backlog, critical nature of our largest end markets, and the continued value proposition of our differentiated products. We anticipate our utility business overall, which is our largest end market, will grow high single digits in 2023.  On the wastewater side, we expect mid-single-digit growth as we see a continuation of steady global demand. We anticipate resilient OpEx demand in developed markets due to the critical nature of our offerings as well as the benefit of continued CapEx spend in emerging markets. The outlook for longer-term capital project spending and bid activity remains robust. On the clean water side, we anticipate revenues being up low teens. This growth is driven by continued robust demand for our AMI solutions and expected improvements in ship supply through 2023, allowing for significant large deal deployments already secured in our backlog. We foresee healthy momentum in our test and measurement and our pipeline assessment service businesses due to increased focus on infrastructure and climate challenges.  Looking at the industrial end market, we expect to go low to mid-single digits on steady demand for our solutions globally. We continue to see strong growth in dewatering due to mining demand in emerging markets and the benefits of our strategic investments in our U.S. and European dewatering business. The commercial end market should deliver low single-digit growth on solid replacement business and backlog execution, partially offset by moderation in new construction. In residential, our smallest end market, we are expecting low single-digit decline due to normalizing demand in the U.S., partially offset by continued strength in emerging markets. In both commercial and residential, we would expect moderation to emerge in the second half results as we continue to work through the backlog in the first half of 2023. Now I'll turn it over to Sandy to walk you through our updated guidance. Yes. I think the only thing I would add, Deane, is that we did pivot in Q4 to a more continuous improvement as we started to roll off of our product redesigns. So we saw a really good lift in Q4 and continuous improvement. And if you look at the price cost and the exit rate in Q4, it was really solid building momentum. This was -- if you recall, this was the last segment to really be impacted by inflation and really overcoming that in Q4, which also led to the margin improvement. Yes. So from a pricing point of view, Deane, really there's an implementation cost, obviously, to go implement the platform, which is a fee. And then it's really, to your point, a Software-as-a-Service. It's a subscription fee that's ongoing in some term is really the model that we've built. And just really amplifying your point, again, one of the biggest pain points we hear and we believe really this partnership will translate into really the digital adoption rates in the water sector. We see this as really being an aggregator in terms of bringing all these disparate systems together that Patrick mentioned. And our teams are engaged in building commercial momentum. We've implemented a few pilots that are starting to see great results from our collaboration already. But as we ramp through the year and build backlog, that will start to really unpack in Q4 and into '24. And Joe, just to add, what -- when we say it's built by utility for, utilities is that there are many other solutions that are out there, but they can tend to be quite complex and overly sophisticated. And this really allows them to design a solution that meets the utility where they are on the journey. Not every utility is of the same space or the same place in the journey as to how sophisticated the system needs to be. And so it could be tailored in that regard, but it's also a highly standardized platform. And that's part of the efficiency of their rollout is how easy it is to maintain. Yes. I was just going to build on the M&CS comment. We still have 30% of the backlog past due coming into the year. And so we'll still continue to monitor that as the chip supply continues sequentially to improve. That's something where we're looking at. But orders sequentially are good in that business, and we see good momentum going forward commercially. Yes. From a bidding pipeline standpoint, I would say, look, industrial remains really strong globally. We primarily play in the general industry. there, and that's been pretty resilient. So that continues strong. Commercial is a bit of -- it's showing strength, however, expected to be slow in the back half, primarily due to new construction moderating. We track the ABI Index, the architectural billing index, that's been less than 50 in the past 3 months. And so looking for a little bit of a slowdown in the bid activity for new construction for commercial. And we talked resi, that's primarily a replacement for us. the orders are slowing down, largely due to the improved supply chain. It's probably the biggest area that we've seen the supply chain improve and also from pandemic investments. And so that's really what's impacted that. And then a strong pipeline in M&CS, plus water infrastructure, especially treatment. We're starting to see treatment really ramp up and the net backlog also continues to build, and we have a strong funnel. Yes. We did -- Scott, we did the last round of price increases back in November of 2022. So really, the price increase, in essence would be for '23 kind of heading into this year. So obviously, we're continuing to watch the marketplace and understand not only the inflationary environment and how that continues on. It really -- it's moderated some, but it's still up and also just also make sure we're monitoring our win-loss rate in the marketplace and making sure that we're appropriately priced accordingly in the market. Yes. So Andy, on the first one on channel inventory. We have really good visibility into the inventory given our relationship with our channel partners. The teams we meet monthly and actually quarterly with counsel meetings in addition to weekly sales calls in contact. So we have really good insight into the inventory. The levels are healthy and normalizing and they're not sitting on any excess inventory, which is reported back to us. There are some pockets that have not fully recovered. Commercial is not back to kind of prepandemic levels in terms of inventory. But resi, I would say, is normalized due to the improved supply chain and softening from the pandemic investments. On the industrial front, that's really more of an engineer-to-order product. There's not a lot of build to stock. And so that's where I'd leave it on the channel inventory there. Yes. We made a constant effort back a few years ago to be a bit more balanced in our segmentation of that business, especially shifting more to the muni side, which is a bit more stable. And we've seen that part of the portfolio grow and also just making investments in our fleet and upgrading our technology. We are digitizing those assets and making those remotely connectable so we can improve the productivity for our customers. So it's a mixed bag of really, I'd say, some innovation as well as being thoughtful about being more balanced in the segmentation of the business."

Now, please turn to Slide 4 and I\u2019ll turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Patrick Decker.\nPatrick Decker: Thanks, Andrea and good morning, everyone. We're pleased to announce a very strong third quarter performance, continuing our momentum from the first half of the year. Across the board, the team delivered above expectations with all our business segments and regions posting strong double-digit revenue growth. And we see quite resilient demand in our backlogs and bidding pipeline. Overall, revenues were up 16% for the quarter, beating the high end of our guidance by 4 percentage points. Applied Water grew fastest at 20%. Water infrastructure exceeded expectations by the widest margin and M&CS came in right on target with healthy mid-teens growth. Regionally, Americas, Western Europe and emerging markets each grew mid-teens. Demand at all of our largest end markets continued to be strong driven by the essential nature of our solutions and services and by intensifying long-term trends in Water. The team, from our factories to our channel partners and distributors, also delivered a tremendous operational performance. Their actions entirely offset inflation with very strong price cost discipline and effectively manage through continuing chip supply constraints. That focus paid off in growth but also with very strong EBITDA margin expansion. Margins exceeded the high end of our guidance by 130 basis points. This delivered on our previous commitment to significantly improve our margins in the second half of this year. Strong organic revenue growth and accretive margins drove third quarter earnings well above expectations, with earnings per share of $0.79. As you all know, our key end markets have consistently been resilient in the face of macroeconomic headwinds and we expect that underlying demand pattern to continue. M&CS orders continue to be very strong. Water Infrastructure was up solidly. Backlogs continue to be up sharply year-over-year and the digital solutions proportion of our backlogs continue to expand. That said, some of our smaller end markets are more cyclical, such as residential within our Applied Water segment. Orders in those markets were down in the quarter and are expected to remain soft. Looking forward, we anticipate the demand dynamics of the third quarter to continue into 2023. On supply, especially chip supply, the outlook remains consistent with what we said last quarter. As expected, we have not seen meaningful easing of chip supply constraints. But forecasting visibility has improved, as has the reliability of deliveries. We expect to exit the year as we've outlined before. Things are gradually improving. Given the resilience of our demand profile, the vitality of our business and the team\u2019s strong operational track record in this environment, we are raising our full year guidance. We now expect full year adjusted earnings per share to be between $2.65 to $2.75 on organic revenue growth between 9% and 10%. In a few minutes, we\u2019ll discuss dynamics in our different end markets, along with some trends we\u2019re seeing through the current cycle. I\u2019ll also touch on how we\u2019re serving communities as they invest to become more resilient in the face of intensifying water challenges. But first, let me hand it over to Sandy to offer you some more detail on the third quarter.\nSandy Rowland: Thanks, Patrick. Please turn to Slide 5. The team did a great job over delivering on commitments with disciplined commercial and operational execution on continuing strong demand. As a result, revenues grew globally, high teens in the U.S. and mid-teens in emerging markets in Western Europe on strong price and backlog execution as supply chains modestly improved. In a moment, I'll detail performance by segment. But in short, utilities was up 15%, led by strength in the U.S. and Western Europe. Industrial grew 16% with strength across all geographies, particularly in emerging markets in Western Europe. Commercial was up 17%, mainly due to strong backlog execution in the U.S.; and Residential was up 19%, led by commercial execution and backlog conversion in the U.S. Global demand remains healthy on strong end market fundamentals, especially in Water Infrastructure and M&CS. That said, organic orders were down 1% in the quarter versus up 20% in the same period last year. Water Infrastructure was up 3%, AWS down 4% and M&CS down 2%. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 18.3%, up 40 basis points from the prior year and up 170 basis points sequentially as price more than offset inflation. And as Patrick mentioned, our EPS in the quarter was $0.79, well above expectations. Please turn to Slide 6 and I'll review the quarter's performance by segment. Water Infrastructure revenue grew 13% organically in the quarter, exceeding expectations. Growth was broad-based, led by our wastewater utility business in the U.S. and Western Europe, both up high teens as supply chain constraints improved. Industrial growth remained robust, driven by continued dewatering demand in emerging markets and increased activity in Western Europe. Geographically, Western Europe grew mid-teens, driven by robust transport and treatment demand. The U.S. was up low teens, led by strong utilities OpEx demand. Emerging Markets was up low double digits, driven by strength across Latin America and Africa, a continued growth in dewatering. Orders in the third quarter were up 3% organically with robust dewatering demand in emerging markets and continued utilities strengths in the U.S. Segment EBITDA margin was largely in line with the prior year as favorable price realization offset inflation but was also impacted by unfavorable mix and strategic investments. Please turn to Page 7. SP999 In the Applied Water segment, third quarter revenues grew 20% organically, exceeding expectations. Growth was robust across all end markets, with each up high teens or greater. Geographically, the U.S. was up high teens with strength across all 3 end markets due to price realization and modest improvements in supply chain. Western Europe was also up high teens, led by growth in industrial, on strong price and continued demand. Emerging Markets was up almost 30%, driven by strong industrial demand in China and commercial development in the Middle East and Africa. Orders were down 4% organically with continued growth in emerging markets, offset by some moderation in Residential in the U.S. As a reminder, Residential, our most cyclical end market, is only about 5% of our overall revenue. EBITDA margin for the segment was up 110 basis points compared to the prior year and 200 basis points sequentially. Margin expansion was driven by strong price realization, more than offsetting inflation, supplemented with productivity savings. And now, let's turn to Slide 8 and I'll cover our Measurement & Control Solutions business. M&CS revenue was up 15% organically, in line with our prior guidance as chip supply played out as expected, with continued modest improvement sequentially. We also saw strong growth in test applications and our pipeline assessment services business. Geographically, the U.S. was up more than 20% on improved chip availability versus the prior year and favorable price realization. Emerging Markets was up mid-teens and Western Europe was up high single digits, driven by strength in our Test and Pipeline Assessment Services businesses. M&CS orders declined 2% organically in the quarter, lapping a tough prior year compare of 42% orders growth. Underlying demand for our AMI offerings remains strong and orders continue to outpace revenue, yielding backlog growth of 35% versus the prior year. Our M&CS backlog alone exceeds $2 billion. Segment EBITDA margin in the quarter expanded 400 basis points sequentially and is now approaching prior year levels. The team did a great job driving margin improvement, even though volumes continue to be constrained by chip supply. And now let's turn to Slide 9 for an overview of cash flows and our balance sheet. In the third quarter, we generated free cash flow of $149 million, driven by income conversion, partially offset by higher working capital. You will note that our working capital levels are elevated as we've chosen to carry about 30 days of extra inventory. And while supply chains are gradually improving, delivery metrics are below historical levels and we can best serve our customers and communities by making this short-term investment. Having said that, our financial position remains strong with $1.2 billion in cash and $2 billion of available liquidity and our net debt-to-EBITDA leverage is 1.3x. Please turn to Slide 10 and I'll hand it back to Patrick to give some color on underlying demand.\nPatrick Decker: Thanks, Sandy. In our last quarter's earnings call, we impact how demand in different end markets respond to macroeconomic headwinds. What we described then is what we're seeing in the marketplace now with healthy underlying demand in our largest end markets. Those patterns have repeated over past economic cycles. So they inform how we manage our operations in an environment like this one. Since all water is local, we experienced those patterns and trends playing out at a community level. What we're seeing is more and more communities selling increasing impact from climate change. They're finding their aging infrastructure isn't up to the task and then confronting the economic anxiety of major upgrades. So communities are investing both in short-term response and in longer-term resilience. Infrastructure investment is the much bigger driver of underlying demand. But our customers have to know we will also be there in near-term crisis which are happening all too frequently. For example, when Hurricane Ian hit Florida, our dewatering pumps were already in place ahead of the storm to prevent the worst and recover fast. And storms are the only immediate needs. One Southeastern U.S. city called us with sewer lines leaching waste into community groundwater and their aging pipes are on the brink of collapse. Within days of that call, we were building [indiscernible] that will help that city's wastewater treatment running without interruption, while they make long-term repairs. Helping communities respond to shocks is a fundamental part of our mission. But the more durable value is in helping communities build the strength to withstand future water challenges and economic stresses. Xylem Solutions like advanced metering infrastructure, wastewater network optimization and municipal water recycling, amongst so many others, provide much more than compelling economics. They deliver game-changing resilience. With AMI as an example, cities can cut off water in the event of storm damage, respond instantly to customer crisis and even promote conservation through periods of scarcity and drought. And all of that additional capability costs a city less than their conventional meter networks. That value equation isn't unique to AMI. It's a hallmark of digital solutions across our Xylem portfolio, greater resilience and capability delivered far more affordably than conventional approaches. Those benefits are so important to our customers that we have been steadily extending digital capability into every part of our portfolio. The mini water crisis making headlines in recent months make it clear that the effects of climate change are already driving rapid increases in cost at the community level. To attack the problem at its source, more and more cities are making net zero emissions commitments. Our opportunity is to help water utilities reduce their own carbon footprint. More than 80 leading utilities around the world have already set net zero targets. Last month at Webtech which is one of the largest water trade events each year, we shared research showing how utilities can dramatically cut their emissions while boosting operational efficiency at the same time. The message is good for our customers, good for communities and good for our business. With existing technologies, you can reduce emissions quickly at low cost or even saving money. I am so proud of the team for leading the way on this topic with our customers and our communities. Several of my Xylem colleagues will be speaking at the upcoming COP27 climate meetings in Egypt later this month, to promote the discussion of water which we believe is the most important topic of our time. Now, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Sandy to provide detail on our increased guidance and outlook for the year.\nSandy Rowland: Thanks, Patrick. Consistent with our previous presentations, we provided key facts for each end market in the appendix. The 2022 full year outlook across our end markets remains largely in line with our previous guidance, with an increase in commercial upon improved backlog execution. We expect healthy underlying demand will carry on through the remainder of the year with continued modest improvements in supply chain. The outlook for our utility business remains unchanged with mid-single-digit growth across both wastewater and clean water. In wastewater, we see continued OpEx strength and the CapEx outlook is supported by modernization of aging infrastructure and continued new development, particularly in emerging markets. For clean water utilities, although chip supply remains constrained, we do expect a continued modest easing of chip supply sequentially. We also expect momentum in our test and pipeline assessment businesses to continue due to increasing focus on infrastructure and climate challenges. Looking at the industrial end market, we now expect low double-digit growth lifted from a previous range of high single-digit to low double-digit growth, driven by strong global demand for dewatering and continued underlying demand for our solutions in the U.S. and Western Europe. We now expect the commercial end market to deliver high single to low double-digit growth, up from mid-single to high single digits on strong demand and backlog execution. In Residential, our smallest end market, we expect strong price realization and continued backlog execution to drive growth in the high teens. As a reminder, our Commercial and Residential exposure is largely replacement-driven and is approximately 15% of our total revenue. And now let's turn to Slide 12 and I'll walk you through our updated guidance. Our continued out performance gives us confidence to raise our full year guidance for adjusted EPS to a range of $2.65 to $2.75, up from $2.50 to $2.70. Our raised guidance is driven by stronger price, backlog execution and continued underlying demand. We are also lifting the low end of our full year organic revenue growth, now 9% to 10%, up from 8% to 10%. Our revenue outlook on a reported basis is largely unchanged due to FX headwinds. Looking by segment, we expect high single-digit growth in Water Infrastructure and low double-digit growth in Applied Water. We expect measurement and control solutions to be up mid-single digits as chip supply continues to modestly improve. For 2022, we are raising our adjusted EBITDA margin outlook to approximately 17%. We now expect free cash flow conversion to be approximately 80% of net income. This is lower than our previous outlook, largely due to higher working capital levels as I referenced earlier. While we\u2019re carrying about an extra month of inventory, our position is fully aligned with the requirements needed to fulfill our backlog. As supply chain stabilize, we will bring inventory down, enabling us to return free cash flow conversion of at least 100% and as we have consistently done in prior years. We\u2019ve provided you with a number of other full year assumptions on the slide to supplement your models as well as our latest assumptions on our basket of currency exposures which can also be found in the appendix. And now drilling down on the fourth quarter, we anticipate total company organic revenues will be up 12% to 14%. This includes mid-single-digit growth in Water Infrastructure, mid-teens growth in Applied Water and M&CS growth of mid-20%. We expect fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA margin to be in the range of 17.5% to 18.5%. And with that, please turn to Slide 13 and I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Patrick for closing comments.\nPatrick Decker: Thanks, Sandy. I'm very proud of the team's performance overall. We delivered strong results this past quarter by continuing to do what we said we would do. And indeed, the team overdelivered, thanks to our commercial momentum and operational discipline. Even in an environment of macro uncertainty, the durability of our business model and the discipline of our team gives us great confidence in our continued growth and significant value creation over the long run. Before we turn the call over to your questions, I'd like to share a couple of executive appointments we've just made, adding even further strength to Xylem's leadership bench. Earlier, I referred to our strategy of extending digital capabilities across Xylem's product, solutions and services portfolio. We've just taken an important step in accelerating that process, appointing Xylem's first Chief Digital Officer. [Indiscernible] joined our senior leadership team last week, bringing extensive experience of growing digital businesses in the industrial sector. He'll be working with the team to further build out a simple powerful platform of digitized solutions for our customers and communities. He joins us in Danaher and I look forward to introducing him to you in future conversations. Before sharing our second recent appointment, I first want to recognize a colleague many of you know. Tony Milando our Chief Supply Chain Officer, has been looking for to retirement for a while but he graciously agreed to stay on while helping us guide the company through the challenges of the pandemic. He's built agility and durability into our supply chain, put safety and sustainability at the center of our operations and created a culture of continuous improvement that has made operational excellence a core part of Xylem's competitive advantage. We're finally letting Tony retire but his contributions will continue to benefit our stakeholders for many years to come. To build on the foundation of excellence that Tony has laid, we've appointed [indiscernible] Xylem's Chief Operations and Supply Chain Officer. Tom joined us next week coming from Generac Power Systems and he brings 20-plus years of experience leading global supply chains and operations in the industrial and services sectors. We're very pleased to welcome Tom at a time when supply chain and operations continue to be a foundation of competitive advantage. His remit is to take our operational excellence to the next level. Tony is going to stay on for a brief time to give him a good start and ensure a smooth transition. So with that, operator, let's now open it up for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.\nDeane Dray: Can I start with -- I want to wish Tony all the best. He\u2019s been a tremendous help all along. So we\u2019ll miss him but wish him well. And welcome to the 2 new leaders, Tom and [indiscernible].\nPatrick Decker: Thank you, Deane. Happy to have him on board and with mixed emotions to see Tony move on. But yes, it's been a great run. -- for sure.\nDeane Dray: All right. So first question and look, really good numbers here, good growth. So that all kind of is a standout. What I\u2019d like to talk about is the forward look -- and for the fourth quarter, just talk about the backlog conversion, earnings visibility and how has -- how did October get off in terms of demand?\nSandy Rowland: Yes. Deane, let me start there. I think we've built good momentum throughout the year. We've had -- throughout the year, we've had strong orders growth all along. I think we have good visibility into Q4. The way we're kind of envisioning it is that it looks very much like what we just printed in Q3. So we'll see strong top line growth, EBITDA margins that are very similar to the strong step-up that we saw from Q2 to Q3 this year and maybe a little bit of a difference in mix. Water Infrastructure typically has a stronger Q4 when projects get completed towards the end of the year. A little bit of moderation in AWS. They were doing some catch-up orders to work through some of the supply chain and a slight ramp in M&CS. As we've talked about on prior calls, we're continuing to see a more modest step-up on the chip supply situation. And then sometimes in the -- towards the back half, second half of 2023 when the redesign work and some more supply comes online, you'll see a bigger ramp. So long story short, I think our Q3 and our Q4 look pretty similar. All along, we've called for a stronger back half compared to our first half. And we're really happy to report that that's playing out very much in line with our expectations.\nDeane Dray: And specifically on backlog, what would be the typical 4Q backlog conversion on a percent basis versus what you\u2019re expecting this quarter?\nSandy Rowland: Yes. I'll give you some color around the backlog. When we look year-over-year, the backlogs are up about 30%. It's a little higher than that in M&CS and a little bit lower than that in the other 2 businesses. So all around, Deane, backlogs remain elevated. And so we're not able to convert as much of the backlog as we would have in other periods. And that's not because production levels are falling short. It's just because backlog still remain elevated.\nPatrick Decker: And Deane, I would just offer that coming into this quarter, like we did this past our Applied Water backlog is up almost at least a month or more normally than what we would have visibility to. That's because of supply chain constraints -- we're going to -- and demand. We're going to see that begin to work off in Q4 going into Q1. And so Applied Water will normalize down to its historical levels which is still going to be attractive at very attractive margins. But where you're really going to see the strength come through continued is in the Water Infrastructure resilience because of utility demand and again, the conversion of chip supply on M&CS and given the deals that we've gotten back on.\nDeane Dray: That\u2019s real helpful. And then just as a follow-up, on free cash flow, completely understand the tweak here, adding more inventory. We\u2019re seeing that elsewhere. But maybe share for us, Sandy, the precision, adding an extra 30 days, how does that square across the segments? And maybe weave in like how has lead times on -- how heavy [ph] lead times with your suppliers? How are those trending? Are they beginning anything close to normalization there?\nSandy Rowland: Yes, great question. I think, first of all, Deane, where our inventory is most elevated is within our AWS segment. And in that supply chain, we have more China dependency, more global dependency from a supply chain perspective than we do in our other businesses. And so as -- that's where we've seen more disruptions as well. So that's exactly where we put some higher inventory levels. I would say that we've done a lot of scrubbing to make sure that, that inventory aligns with what we're seeing from a backlog perspective and we feel very, very good about that.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Nathan Jones with Stifel.\nNathan Jones: I will -- I\u2019ll start off on price and price cost. It was very good to see price more than offset inflation this quarter. Can you maybe talk about the pricing trends, the inflation trends? Should we continue to see price ramp up over the next couple of quarters as more price read through? Should we start to see the year-over inflation moderate? And so maybe price cost becomes an even bigger tailwind to margins over the next 2 or 3 quarters?\nSandy Rowland: Yes. I think, Nate, obviously, this has been something that our teams have been really focused on all year long. And I really applaud the good work that our commercial teams have done securing these important price increases to get in line with inflation. So a couple of milestones. On a year-to-date basis now, we're price cost neutral. In the quarter, we were ahead from a price cost perspective on both a dollar perspective and a percentage perspective. We still expect that price will be a tailwind in Q4 and that's part of the year-over-year margin expansion that we're calling for. Having said that, we start to anniversary some of the quarters where we secured price momentum. And so that starts to happen a little bit in Q4 and more as we move into Q3. But I think as we go into 2023, we'll be in a better spot from a price cost perspective than we certainly were going in this year.\nNathan Jones: And you probably start to anniversary the worst of the inflation comps at the same time, right?\nSandy Rowland: Yes. And so I think inflation, we've definitely seen an increase inflation compared to what we guided initially this year. We sort of came into the year thinking inflation would run around 10% or 11%. When we look all in for the year, inflation is running more in the mid-teens. I would say there is some slight moderation from a commodity perspective but we're still seeing headwinds on inflation in both areas like energy, particularly in Europe. And labor inflation is still out there. And when we look at labor inflation, that's not transitory, that's probably more permanent. So our pricing strategies are dynamic and they need to be in line with what we're seeing and experiencing from a costing perspective.\nNathan Jones: And I would think we should probably see the pricing improve in M&CS as we go forward. It\u2019s the segment where it looks like pricing is coming through the lowest. Some of that backlog that doesn\u2019t get repriced. I would pick some of that, it\u2019s a bit hard to tell your customers you\u2019re raising prices when you have all that pass-through backlog. So should we see price read through more in 2023 in the M&CS segment as we start to clear some of that?\nSandy Rowland: Yes. Yes, I think our -- where we've seen price -- we've seen -- it's sort of matched where we've seen the highest inflation levels. And so from an ordering perspective, that's been AWS, what our Infrastructure and M&CS. Having said that, if you look at the past couple of quarters, we're starting to see some of our price increases that we've implemented in M&CS drop through. And so we still have good momentum there from a pricing perspective. And I think you'll continue to see that through the next couple of quarters. And I think that's also made a significant part of why we saw quarter sequential improvement in the M&CS EBITDA rate.\nPatrick Decker: And I think, Nate, I would just offer on the M&CS side, specifically, AMI deals. Again, these are long lead time negotiated regulatory approval deals. They\u2019ve got great economics associated with them. And I think our customers understand that we\u2019re operating in a fairly high inflationary environment and they understand. And they understand that we\u2019re being very transparent with them, around what the inflation impact goes in us and that we\u2019re being responsible and disciplined. And the economics of these deals are so important to them that right now, the most important thing we can do is just continue to get chips and get the meters installed. And the good news is we\u2019ve not seen any cancellations of those deals and backlog. So we feel good. We wish we had more chips, of course. But again, these projects require multiyear planning and utilities don\u2019t tend to go backwards on these deals.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Michael Halloran with Baird.\nMichael Halloran: So a couple here. First, just on the utility building cycle which I suppose dovetails a little bit of the comments you just made there, Patrick. But -- what\u2019s the frontlog look at this point? And what\u2019s the -- and that\u2019s kind of part 1 of the question and what the kind of underlying thought process is at the utility level today? And then secondarily, any update on what the adoption looks like for the more technology-oriented pieces of that utility pie?\nPatrick Decker: Yes. So as you know, Mike, the -- so roughly 70% of our demand in utilities is OpEx. So it's repair replacement, very stable. If anything, right now, I would say it's probably overcharged because of just aging infrastructure and climate change. So we're seeing really strong growth there. CapEx which is the 30% roughly and this is a global number, not just the U.S. That's the one that we do keep close eye on throughout cycles. And as you know, what we've tended to see is the one driver that can lead to a reduction in CapEx spend historically if we were to see it which we've not seen it yet. I mean our frontline right -- our frontlog right now is very strong. the bidding pipeline is very strong right now. But if we were to see a slowdown in muni-tax receipts, if we were to see a slowdown prolonged in residential expansion in the U.S., those things tend to be later cycle, so it'd be a couple of years down the road. We're not seeing it right now, Mike but that's what we would look for -- on -- and that's on the wastewater side. Now historically, even during the past recessions around the world, if you set aside dewatering for a moment which does tend to be more short cycle and we diversified that part of the business away from kind of pure mining, oil and gas were much more in the muni space now and broader industrial space. But we would see it there. We haven't seen it. And we would ultimately see maybe a low single-digit kind of water infrastructure growth if we were to see a recession but we've not seen that in our frontlogs at this point in time. So we're keeping a close eye on it and we're trying to be responsible and prudent in our planning here.\nMichael Halloran: Great. Second one, just on the European side of things. It seems awfully resilient from you at this point. Just some thoughts on the trends you\u2019re seeing on that side.\nSandy Rowland: Yes. We look at our results, Mike, in Europe and they're very, very strong. We're also seeing good orders growth, especially on a year-to-date basis. And when we look historically and benchmark kind of one region to the other, Europe tends to be very steady. And I think you see very disciplined and resilient spend from the European -- so I think -- the European market. So on the industrial side, we're not seeing a slowdown either. So -- we're staying close to it. We're talking very frequently with our commercial teams who are in constant contact with our customers. But so far, it's hanging in there.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Scott Davis with Melius Research.\nScott Davis: Can we talk a little bit about M&A and your pipeline and it seems your balance sheet is in just great shape and asset prices are coming down a bit. So just some color on that would be helpful.\nPatrick Decker: Sure. Yes. So as you said, Scott, we've got a really strong balance sheet. I mean we've got $2 billion liquidity. We got probably firepower of north of $4 billion. We're not going to hesitate if the opportunity presents itself. Pipeline remains really robust. It's a combination of larger opportunities. But we've got a number of small, medium-sized opportunities that are out there, mainly in the utilities space but also in the industrial services space. And so we're going to continue to be disciplined. As you well know, it always takes two to tango. But nothing's changed in our view on valuations and our discipline in that space.\nScott Davis: Okay. Helpful. And then can you guys just remind us, [indiscernible], Sandy, you can help with us on these big extreme moves we\u2019ve had in FX and you guys have a little bit different clearly situation than most of the companies we cover. But the net-net of all the different moves in FX, what that really means for you guys?\nSandy Rowland: Yes. So I mean, I think when you look sort of year-over-year -- actually compared to our budget, we're seeing significant headwinds from an FX perspective. I would say from an EPS perspective, it's been a negative by about $0.15 to $0.20. We'll see where the things ultimately shake out in the fourth quarter because even over the past months, the FX rates have been volatile. But I think we're really proud of the team. That's one of the challenges we've been able to overcome when we look at sort of we started the year and where we stand today. Just as an example, we started the year planning for a euro assumption at 1.13, dipping down below a 1:1 ratio for the end of last quarter and into this quarter. So good work that we've been able to overcome, continue to stay disciplined and controlling what we can control.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Joe Giordano with Cowen.\nJoe Giordano: I thought it was interesting on the new role for a Chief Digital Officer. Can you talk about like the buy versus build proposition for a true digital platform kind of like on top of your AMI platform?\nPatrick Decker: Sure. That's a great question, Joe. So digital is certainly not new. So we've got a great foundation that we've already built, both organically as well as through a number of the acquisitions we've done. So [indiscernible] comes in really building on that solid foundation. We are continuing to look at the opportunity to both build internally which is really as much about talent capability, commercializing, selling those opportunities. But our pipeline from an M&A standpoint is still very much focused on adding other solutions and technologies to the mix. And I look forward to having [indiscernible] join us on one of our upcoming calls and share his perspective on what he sees and the opportunities in front of us. But it's a combination, Joe, between organic and M&A.\nJoe Giordano: Okay, great. I know -- look, it's good to see the progress at M&CS but I know that you're not happy with where margins are like big picture. So can you kind of walk us from where we're exiting this year to like what a 20% margin looks like at M&CS, like on EBITDA, what things have to happen to get there?\nSandy Rowland: Yes. I think great question, Joe. We've been working really hard to get our margins back up in the M&CS side. And obviously, volume plays a big role in that. we've talked historically that when we get revenue up into the $350 million level per quarter, you'll see revenues -- you'll see EBITDA margins in the mid-teens. To get to the high teens, 20% benchmark, we need to be north of $400 million of revenue per quarter. And we are certainly focused on productivity initiatives the disciplined steps we're taking around, pricing and looking at our backlog and incremental pricing opportunities there are an important catalyst as well. And then, of course, our backlog has a higher digital mix. And so that will naturally bring with it some higher margins. So it's a real combination of factors and the good news is we've seen some uptick in the revenue, a little bit of a flattening from Q2 to Q3 and we'll expect that continued moderation and then another kind of step up more in the back half of next year.\nPatrick Decker: And Joe, I would just add that one of the things that we've not really punctuated in the past is as we were going through the redesign of our chips to be able to help support our customers through this challenging time to move these installations along, there were costs that we added in our P&L to support that. At the same time, we had to redirect some engineering resources away from classic productivity, continuous improvement. So we're working through that. But despite that, you see the margin expansion that we've laid out in the quarter and that we expect for the year and that we expect to win the next year. So I just want to make sure we're making strategic choices here to take care of our customers, not just for the future, for the long run but like right now because that's the value they expect from us.\nJoe Giordano: That all makes sense. And just last quick for me. Just given how shorter cycle AWS is, I know backlog is extended there but it's like the shortest backlog throughout the company. And just when I think about price this quarter at 1,000 basis points, when price starts to normalize and orders are coming down and that business just starts to get to more like reasonable levels, what do we -- how do we think about like margin deleveraging in that kind of scenario? You made a lot of progress there. So how much of that do you expect to be able to hold on to as volumes kind of come down?\nSandy Rowland: Yes. I think one thing that is important to remember is if you look back the past few quarters, our price increases were not in line with inflation. So we're now at a point where we're getting back to our more historical margins and we can drive margin expansion through productivity levels and incremental growth. So I think we're getting back to a place that's good and healthy for that business and a lot of work to make that happen.\nPatrick Decker: And we continue, Joe, to make investments in innovation and R&D within that segment also within Water Infrastructure. I know M&CS has kind of gotten more the headline over the last few years. But we continue to make increases in R&D spend in those segments because that kind of refreshment of our offerings and portfolio, we see and our new products that we bring to market that they\u2019ve got much higher margin and growth rates than what they\u2019re replacing. So it\u2019s important to note that there\u2019s a refresh that continues to go on in both of those segments.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Andrew Kaplowitz with Citigroup.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Patrick, I know you\u2019ve said that you have elevated backlog and a strong pipeline of opportunities but just focusing on orders for a second, down a bit this quarter, they decelerated over the last couple of quarters. I know it\u2019s really just more difficult comps. But you did mention a little slower U.S. in Applied Water, for instance. So could you give us some more color into what you\u2019re seeing in orders and whether you believe orders will continue to decelerate or how to think about orders going into '23?\nPatrick Decker: Sure. So we feel good about the trend lines on demand. And again, that goes back to the question around what our frontlogs look like in terms of bidding pipeline, whether that be AMI, whether that be treatment which is a precursor for wastewater demand and we see healthy demand within our channel partners, even on the Applied Water side. So it is really a year-over-year comp issue. If you look at our orders year-to-date, we're still up 7% year-to-date and it really is a tough comp in the third quarter. I would say that, again, it varies by end market. We've obviously -- we haven't talked China, for example. China is 7% of our revenue. China was up 10% in the third quarter on revenue. But I would say that the public utility funding there in China has been pushed to the right because of the lockdown restrictions there. But we still expect there to be a recovery in utilities but it's probably not going to be until later next year. And there is no change in our long-term plan or outlook on China. But it's a meaningful part of our revenue and we've overcome that with demand across the rest of the portfolio. So the fundamentals are there. We are watching all the signs. We've got our KPIs that we track, especially in our short-cycle businesses. We have seen some moderation, as Sandy said earlier, in Residential which is a very small part of our business. We've seen some slowdown in a couple of other small pieces of our business. So we'll keep a close eye on it. I mean we're not out of the woods yet. But even in commercial, the ABI, the Architectural Billing Index, is still strong at north of 50. And when it's north of 50, that indicates strength in that part of our segment which we continued to see growth in. But again, we're keeping a close eye on all this, Andy.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Very helpful, Patrick. And maybe if I could just follow up on your dewatering business. Kind of a similar question. I know you raised your industrial growth to low teens but what are your industrial customers telling you about the opportunities in dewatering? And do you see those orders staying positive and dewatering into \u201823?\nSandy Rowland: Yes, Andy, good question. We're seeing both strong revenue conversion in dewatering and we're seeing good orders momentum there. I think Patrick referenced a little bit earlier on the call. I think there are some important things to note if you look at our business today than what our business looked like a couple of years ago. Seeing good emerging markets growth, good growth, that includes Latin America as well where they're seeing good activity. We've made some investments on the rental fleet in really all of our markets on a global basis. And those projects are -- have good returns, fast paybacks. We're seeing a lot of that equipment out on order and converting to revenue. And we're still seeing resiliency on our equipment sales side of the business in dewatering. Put it right up there in one of those end markets that we need to really continue to focus on. It is absolutely one of the shorter cycle businesses and understanding the -- what our customers are seeing is important there. So -- but so far, that's been pretty resilient.\nPatrick Decker: I would just add Andy, that the thing -- when we say customers and dewatering, there's the part that we handle direct, where we have our rental fleet and then there are our channel partners that we actually replenish their fleet and then they have their own rental fleet. And in the past, the part of that business that can turn very quickly is if our channel partners that are all local around the U.S. predominantly, if they get nervous and they see things, they then pull back on replenishing their fleet and that can happen very short cycle. And so we are in regular calls with them to get a feel for how they're feeling about the general macro economy right now. Thus far, it's strong and resilient but that's the area that we would keep a very close eye on.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Brian Lee with Goldman Sachs.\nBrian Lee: I guess first question I had just following up on an earlier one. Price read out by almost 250 basis points more this quarter than in 2Q. It sounded like based on Sandy\u2019s comments that maybe you\u2019re starting to see a peaking sort of cadence in terms of price. So I just wanted to make sure that I heard that correctly. And as we start to lap some of the price increases over the past year and we head into \u201823, are we thinking more like a typical low single-digit price year starting early next year, just kind of get a sense of the cadence of price are into next year?\nSandy Rowland: Yes, Brian, I think I touched on it a little bit earlier. Last year, starting in Q4 is really where we started to see some of the impact of our price increases, hitting our revenue. So absolutely, the compares start to get tougher, a little bit tougher next quarter. I think you're going to still see strong pricing. It should be one of the key drivers for the margin expansion that we're calling for. And then we're obviously -- pricing has become very dynamic. It's not a decision we make at one point in time. We need to continue to take all the inputs from we're seeing on all the different components of our bill of materials, everything from the commodities we buy to the freight costs to deliver the product. So I'm not going to share what our price realization looks like for 2023 at this time. Certainly, we're in a much, much better position as we go into '23 from an equilibrium perspective around on price cost.\nBrian Lee: Absolutely. Yes, makes sense. And I guess a follow-up here, just to focus too much on the short term. But if I look at the guidance here for 4Q, I know nothing about the past couple of years has been sort of normal but it does imply a pretty flattish performance across key metrics, revenue, EBITDA, operating margin. Seasonally, you typically have a pretty meaningful increase from 3Q to 4Q across a lot of those headline metrics. So kind of walk us through, is there anything impacting near-term seasonality in the model here? You just kind of working off more backlog in 3Q than you expected. Just any sense of why this year, maybe 3Q to 4Q is a little bit lighter than you typically see in past years?\nSandy Rowland: Yes. I think you touched on a bit of it, Brian. If you look at particularly our water infrastructure business, we typically see a bigger drop-off Q2 to Q3. We didn't see that as much this year. That was a big part of why our revenue came in higher. And so as a result of that, we see more of a flattening Q3 to -- we still see a little bit of a step-up going into Q4 on Water Infrastructure but not as dramatic. And some of that is -- we did see a little bit of supply chain improvement and we got some more projects across the finish line. So for the full year, yes, Q3 and Q4 look good. It's a big step-up from what we saw in the first half and we're exiting the year right in line with what we were expecting.\nPatrick Decker: Yes. And I think, Brian, the other -- I mean, regionally, the 2 areas that I would say that we\u2019re just seeing things playing out a little bit differently this year than we have in the past. I mentioned earlier, things shifting to the right in China. And again, we have the uncertainties in Europe. And so we just think it\u2019s prudent to build that into our outlook for Q4.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Saree Boroditsky with Jefferies.\nSaree Boroditsky: A lot has been covered on the call but there is a big differential between the strong order growth between Applied Water growth and the decline in orders. So since you expect to work down the backlog through this year, how do you think about growth as we head into 2023?\nPatrick Decker: Is that specifically for Applied Water?\nSaree Boroditsky: Yes for Applied Water.\nSandy Rowland: Yes, I\u2019ll take it. We obviously have a very elevated backlog in AWS. We have more than doubled the backlog than we typically have in any one quarter. And so I think -- we actually are able to work some of that backlog down. I think it\u2019s a real positive sign that supply chains are improving, that customers are reverting back to more typical ordering patterns. And as we look at that business longer term, it\u2019s probably the lowest grower in our portfolio. It delivers a lot of cash. It\u2019s a good operating business for us. But over a longer-term basis, it\u2019s low to mid-single-digit grower in our portfolio. And when do we exactly revert to those levels and it will take a little bit of time to work through the backlog. But that\u2019s sort of how we see that business longer term fitting into our portfolio.\nPatrick Decker: I mean we look at that part of our portfolio as market growth itself is GDP on a global basis. And we always look to and have historically beat that by some share gain. And that comes through investments in innovation through R&D. We continue to refresh the portfolio. But to Sandy's point, we're coming off of elevated backlogs due to one demand but also supply chain constraints. We'll see that normalize as we go into 2023. And in our upcoming call, we'll lay out by segment what our outlook is for '23.\nSaree Boroditsky: Great. That\u2019s helpful. And then obviously, you put out the strong book to build in AMI. How long and advanced are you seeing customers place their orders? And then when does this show up in revenues?\nSandy Rowland: AMI is -- it's a very long selling cycle. It's a big decision for the utilities to make -- we're working on RFPs that go out anywhere from 1 to 3 years. We have a big backlog in M&CS. If you look today, we still have about 1/4 of it that's past due. And so we're going to start working through that as chip supply recover. What we're most excited about is that the pipeline remains strong. We're winning a good percentage of those awards. And the value proposition is very, very sound.\nPatrick Decker: We are still early in the conversion of large utilities across the U.S. to AMI let alone the smaller- to medium-sized utilities. So that\u2019s why the front log, the bidding pipeline looks so attractive across the market and that\u2019s why we remain confident. But these are long-term deals that take a while to negotiate and we\u2019re pleased with our position.\nOperator: It appears that we have no further questions at this time. I will now turn the program back over to Patrick Decker for any additional or closing remarks.\nPatrick Decker: Well, thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning and for your continued interest and support. Really appreciate it. I know between now and the next earnings call, we\u2019ll have a chance to meet with many of you in person. Between now and then, stay safe and safe travels. Look forward to seeing you. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's Xylem third quarter 2022 earnings conference call. Please disconnect your line at this time and have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Sandy Rowland",
            "content": "Thanks, Patrick. Please turn to Slide 5. The team did a great job over delivering on commitments with disciplined commercial and operational execution on continuing strong demand. As a result, revenues grew globally, high teens in the U.S. and mid-teens in emerging markets in Western Europe on strong price and backlog execution as supply chains modestly improved. In a moment, I'll detail performance by segment. But in short, utilities was up 15%, led by strength in the U.S. and Western Europe. Industrial grew 16% with strength across all geographies, particularly in emerging markets in Western Europe. Commercial was up 17%, mainly due to strong backlog execution in the U.S.; and Residential was up 19%, led by commercial execution and backlog conversion in the U.S. Global demand remains healthy on strong end market fundamentals, especially in Water Infrastructure and M&CS. That said, organic orders were down 1% in the quarter versus up 20% in the same period last year. Water Infrastructure was up 3%, AWS down 4% and M&CS down 2%. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 18.3%, up 40 basis points from the prior year and up 170 basis points sequentially as price more than offset inflation. And as Patrick mentioned, our EPS in the quarter was $0.79, well above expectations. Please turn to Slide 6 and I'll review the quarter's performance by segment. Water Infrastructure revenue grew 13% organically in the quarter, exceeding expectations. Growth was broad-based, led by our wastewater utility business in the U.S. and Western Europe, both up high teens as supply chain constraints improved. Industrial growth remained robust, driven by continued dewatering demand in emerging markets and increased activity in Western Europe. Geographically, Western Europe grew mid-teens, driven by robust transport and treatment demand. The U.S. was up low teens, led by strong utilities OpEx demand. Emerging Markets was up low double digits, driven by strength across Latin America and Africa, a continued growth in dewatering. Orders in the third quarter were up 3% organically with robust dewatering demand in emerging markets and continued utilities strengths in the U.S. Segment EBITDA margin was largely in line with the prior year as favorable price realization offset inflation but was also impacted by unfavorable mix and strategic investments. Please turn to Page 7. SP999 In the Applied Water segment, third quarter revenues grew 20% organically, exceeding expectations. Growth was robust across all end markets, with each up high teens or greater. Geographically, the U.S. was up high teens with strength across all 3 end markets due to price realization and modest improvements in supply chain. Western Europe was also up high teens, led by growth in industrial, on strong price and continued demand. Emerging Markets was up almost 30%, driven by strong industrial demand in China and commercial development in the Middle East and Africa. Orders were down 4% organically with continued growth in emerging markets, offset by some moderation in Residential in the U.S. As a reminder, Residential, our most cyclical end market, is only about 5% of our overall revenue. EBITDA margin for the segment was up 110 basis points compared to the prior year and 200 basis points sequentially. Margin expansion was driven by strong price realization, more than offsetting inflation, supplemented with productivity savings. And now, let's turn to Slide 8 and I'll cover our Measurement & Control Solutions business. M&CS revenue was up 15% organically, in line with our prior guidance as chip supply played out as expected, with continued modest improvement sequentially. We also saw strong growth in test applications and our pipeline assessment services business. Geographically, the U.S. was up more than 20% on improved chip availability versus the prior year and favorable price realization. Emerging Markets was up mid-teens and Western Europe was up high single digits, driven by strength in our Test and Pipeline Assessment Services businesses. M&CS orders declined 2% organically in the quarter, lapping a tough prior year compare of 42% orders growth. Underlying demand for our AMI offerings remains strong and orders continue to outpace revenue, yielding backlog growth of 35% versus the prior year. Our M&CS backlog alone exceeds $2 billion. Segment EBITDA margin in the quarter expanded 400 basis points sequentially and is now approaching prior year levels. The team did a great job driving margin improvement, even though volumes continue to be constrained by chip supply. And now let's turn to Slide 9 for an overview of cash flows and our balance sheet. In the third quarter, we generated free cash flow of $149 million, driven by income conversion, partially offset by higher working capital. You will note that our working capital levels are elevated as we've chosen to carry about 30 days of extra inventory. And while supply chains are gradually improving, delivery metrics are below historical levels and we can best serve our customers and communities by making this short-term investment. Having said that, our financial position remains strong with $1.2 billion in cash and $2 billion of available liquidity and our net debt-to-EBITDA leverage is 1.3x. Please turn to Slide 10 and I'll hand it back to Patrick to give some color on underlying demand. Thanks, Patrick. Consistent with our previous presentations, we provided key facts for each end market in the appendix. The 2022 full year outlook across our end markets remains largely in line with our previous guidance, with an increase in commercial upon improved backlog execution. We expect healthy underlying demand will carry on through the remainder of the year with continued modest improvements in supply chain. The outlook for our utility business remains unchanged with mid-single-digit growth across both wastewater and clean water. In wastewater, we see continued OpEx strength and the CapEx outlook is supported by modernization of aging infrastructure and continued new development, particularly in emerging markets. For clean water utilities, although chip supply remains constrained, we do expect a continued modest easing of chip supply sequentially. We also expect momentum in our test and pipeline assessment businesses to continue due to increasing focus on infrastructure and climate challenges. Looking at the industrial end market, we now expect low double-digit growth lifted from a previous range of high single-digit to low double-digit growth, driven by strong global demand for dewatering and continued underlying demand for our solutions in the U.S. and Western Europe. We now expect the commercial end market to deliver high single to low double-digit growth, up from mid-single to high single digits on strong demand and backlog execution. In Residential, our smallest end market, we expect strong price realization and continued backlog execution to drive growth in the high teens. As a reminder, our Commercial and Residential exposure is largely replacement-driven and is approximately 15% of our total revenue. And now let's turn to Slide 12 and I'll walk you through our updated guidance. Our continued out performance gives us confidence to raise our full year guidance for adjusted EPS to a range of $2.65 to $2.75, up from $2.50 to $2.70. Our raised guidance is driven by stronger price, backlog execution and continued underlying demand. We are also lifting the low end of our full year organic revenue growth, now 9% to 10%, up from 8% to 10%. Our revenue outlook on a reported basis is largely unchanged due to FX headwinds. Looking by segment, we expect high single-digit growth in Water Infrastructure and low double-digit growth in Applied Water. We expect measurement and control solutions to be up mid-single digits as chip supply continues to modestly improve. For 2022, we are raising our adjusted EBITDA margin outlook to approximately 17%. We now expect free cash flow conversion to be approximately 80% of net income. This is lower than our previous outlook, largely due to higher working capital levels as I referenced earlier. While we're carrying about an extra month of inventory, our position is fully aligned with the requirements needed to fulfill our backlog. As supply chain stabilize, we will bring inventory down, enabling us to return free cash flow conversion of at least 100% and as we have consistently done in prior years. We've provided you with a number of other full year assumptions on the slide to supplement your models as well as our latest assumptions on our basket of currency exposures which can also be found in the appendix. And now drilling down on the fourth quarter, we anticipate total company organic revenues will be up 12% to 14%. This includes mid-single-digit growth in Water Infrastructure, mid-teens growth in Applied Water and M&CS growth of mid-20%. We expect fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA margin to be in the range of 17.5% to 18.5%. And with that, please turn to Slide 13 and I'll turn the call back over to Patrick for closing comments. Yes. Deane, let me start there. I think we've built good momentum throughout the year. We've had -- throughout the year, we've had strong orders growth all along. I think we have good visibility into Q4. The way we're kind of envisioning it is that it looks very much like what we just printed in Q3. So we'll see strong top line growth, EBITDA margins that are very similar to the strong step-up that we saw from Q2 to Q3 this year and maybe a little bit of a difference in mix. Water Infrastructure typically has a stronger Q4 when projects get completed towards the end of the year. A little bit of moderation in AWS. They were doing some catch-up orders to work through some of the supply chain and a slight ramp in M&CS. As we've talked about on prior calls, we're continuing to see a more modest step-up on the chip supply situation. And then sometimes in the -- towards the back half, second half of 2023 when the redesign work and some more supply comes online, you'll see a bigger ramp. So long story short, I think our Q3 and our Q4 look pretty similar. All along, we've called for a stronger back half compared to our first half. And we're really happy to report that that's playing out very much in line with our expectations. Yes. I'll give you some color around the backlog. When we look year-over-year, the backlogs are up about 30%. It's a little higher than that in M&CS and a little bit lower than that in the other 2 businesses. So all around, Deane, backlogs remain elevated. And so we're not able to convert as much of the backlog as we would have in other periods. And that's not because production levels are falling short. It's just because backlog still remain elevated. Yes, great question. I think, first of all, Deane, where our inventory is most elevated is within our AWS segment. And in that supply chain, we have more China dependency, more global dependency from a supply chain perspective than we do in our other businesses. And so as -- that's where we've seen more disruptions as well. So that's exactly where we put some higher inventory levels. I would say that we've done a lot of scrubbing to make sure that, that inventory aligns with what we're seeing from a backlog perspective and we feel very, very good about that. Yes. I think, Nate, obviously, this has been something that our teams have been really focused on all year long. And I really applaud the good work that our commercial teams have done securing these important price increases to get in line with inflation. So a couple of milestones. On a year-to-date basis now, we're price cost neutral. In the quarter, we were ahead from a price cost perspective on both a dollar perspective and a percentage perspective. We still expect that price will be a tailwind in Q4 and that's part of the year-over-year margin expansion that we're calling for. Having said that, we start to anniversary some of the quarters where we secured price momentum. And so that starts to happen a little bit in Q4 and more as we move into Q3. But I think as we go into 2023, we'll be in a better spot from a price cost perspective than we certainly were going in this year. Yes. And so I think inflation, we've definitely seen an increase inflation compared to what we guided initially this year. We sort of came into the year thinking inflation would run around 10% or 11%. When we look all in for the year, inflation is running more in the mid-teens. I would say there is some slight moderation from a commodity perspective but we're still seeing headwinds on inflation in both areas like energy, particularly in Europe. And labor inflation is still out there. And when we look at labor inflation, that's not transitory, that's probably more permanent. So our pricing strategies are dynamic and they need to be in line with what we're seeing and experiencing from a costing perspective. Yes. Yes, I think our -- where we've seen price -- we've seen -- it's sort of matched where we've seen the highest inflation levels. And so from an ordering perspective, that's been AWS, what our Infrastructure and M&CS. Having said that, if you look at the past couple of quarters, we're starting to see some of our price increases that we've implemented in M&CS drop through. And so we still have good momentum there from a pricing perspective. And I think you'll continue to see that through the next couple of quarters. And I think that's also made a significant part of why we saw quarter sequential improvement in the M&CS EBITDA rate. Yes. We look at our results, Mike, in Europe and they're very, very strong. We're also seeing good orders growth, especially on a year-to-date basis. And when we look historically and benchmark kind of one region to the other, Europe tends to be very steady. And I think you see very disciplined and resilient spend from the European -- so I think -- the European market. So on the industrial side, we're not seeing a slowdown either. So -- we're staying close to it. We're talking very frequently with our commercial teams who are in constant contact with our customers. But so far, it's hanging in there. Yes. So I mean, I think when you look sort of year-over-year -- actually compared to our budget, we're seeing significant headwinds from an FX perspective. I would say from an EPS perspective, it's been a negative by about $0.15 to $0.20. We'll see where the things ultimately shake out in the fourth quarter because even over the past months, the FX rates have been volatile. But I think we're really proud of the team. That's one of the challenges we've been able to overcome when we look at sort of we started the year and where we stand today. Just as an example, we started the year planning for a euro assumption at 1.13, dipping down below a 1:1 ratio for the end of last quarter and into this quarter. So good work that we've been able to overcome, continue to stay disciplined and controlling what we can control. Yes. I think great question, Joe. We've been working really hard to get our margins back up in the M&CS side. And obviously, volume plays a big role in that. we've talked historically that when we get revenue up into the $350 million level per quarter, you'll see revenues -- you'll see EBITDA margins in the mid-teens. To get to the high teens, 20% benchmark, we need to be north of $400 million of revenue per quarter. And we are certainly focused on productivity initiatives the disciplined steps we're taking around, pricing and looking at our backlog and incremental pricing opportunities there are an important catalyst as well. And then, of course, our backlog has a higher digital mix. And so that will naturally bring with it some higher margins. So it's a real combination of factors and the good news is we've seen some uptick in the revenue, a little bit of a flattening from Q2 to Q3 and we'll expect that continued moderation and then another kind of step up more in the back half of next year. Yes. I think one thing that is important to remember is if you look back the past few quarters, our price increases were not in line with inflation. So we're now at a point where we're getting back to our more historical margins and we can drive margin expansion through productivity levels and incremental growth. So I think we're getting back to a place that's good and healthy for that business and a lot of work to make that happen. Yes, Andy, good question. We're seeing both strong revenue conversion in dewatering and we're seeing good orders momentum there. I think Patrick referenced a little bit earlier on the call. I think there are some important things to note if you look at our business today than what our business looked like a couple of years ago. Seeing good emerging markets growth, good growth, that includes Latin America as well where they're seeing good activity. We've made some investments on the rental fleet in really all of our markets on a global basis. And those projects are -- have good returns, fast paybacks. We're seeing a lot of that equipment out on order and converting to revenue. And we're still seeing resiliency on our equipment sales side of the business in dewatering. Put it right up there in one of those end markets that we need to really continue to focus on. It is absolutely one of the shorter cycle businesses and understanding the -- what our customers are seeing is important there. So -- but so far, that's been pretty resilient. Yes, Brian, I think I touched on it a little bit earlier. Last year, starting in Q4 is really where we started to see some of the impact of our price increases, hitting our revenue. So absolutely, the compares start to get tougher, a little bit tougher next quarter. I think you're going to still see strong pricing. It should be one of the key drivers for the margin expansion that we're calling for. And then we're obviously -- pricing has become very dynamic. It's not a decision we make at one point in time. We need to continue to take all the inputs from we're seeing on all the different components of our bill of materials, everything from the commodities we buy to the freight costs to deliver the product. So I'm not going to share what our price realization looks like for 2023 at this time. Certainly, we're in a much, much better position as we go into '23 from an equilibrium perspective around on price cost. Yes. I think you touched on a bit of it, Brian. If you look at particularly our water infrastructure business, we typically see a bigger drop-off Q2 to Q3. We didn't see that as much this year. That was a big part of why our revenue came in higher. And so as a result of that, we see more of a flattening Q3 to -- we still see a little bit of a step-up going into Q4 on Water Infrastructure but not as dramatic. And some of that is -- we did see a little bit of supply chain improvement and we got some more projects across the finish line. So for the full year, yes, Q3 and Q4 look good. It's a big step-up from what we saw in the first half and we're exiting the year right in line with what we were expecting. Yes, I'll take it. We obviously have a very elevated backlog in AWS. We have more than doubled the backlog than we typically have in any one quarter. And so I think -- we actually are able to work some of that backlog down. I think it's a real positive sign that supply chains are improving, that customers are reverting back to more typical ordering patterns. And as we look at that business longer term, it's probably the lowest grower in our portfolio. It delivers a lot of cash. It's a good operating business for us. But over a longer-term basis, it's low to mid-single-digit grower in our portfolio. And when do we exactly revert to those levels and it will take a little bit of time to work through the backlog. But that's sort of how we see that business longer term fitting into our portfolio. AMI is -- it's a very long selling cycle. It's a big decision for the utilities to make -- we're working on RFPs that go out anywhere from 1 to 3 years. We have a big backlog in M&CS. If you look today, we still have about 1/4 of it that's past due. And so we're going to start working through that as chip supply recover. What we're most excited about is that the pipeline remains strong. We're winning a good percentage of those awards. And the value proposition is very, very sound."

            "content": "Thanks, Andrea and good morning, everyone. We're pleased to announce a very strong third quarter performance, continuing our momentum from the first half of the year. Across the board, the team delivered above expectations with all our business segments and regions posting strong double-digit revenue growth. And we see quite resilient demand in our backlogs and bidding pipeline. Overall, revenues were up 16% for the quarter, beating the high end of our guidance by 4 percentage points. Applied Water grew fastest at 20%. Water infrastructure exceeded expectations by the widest margin and M&CS came in right on target with healthy mid-teens growth. Regionally, Americas, Western Europe and emerging markets each grew mid-teens. Demand at all of our largest end markets continued to be strong driven by the essential nature of our solutions and services and by intensifying long-term trends in Water. The team, from our factories to our channel partners and distributors, also delivered a tremendous operational performance. Their actions entirely offset inflation with very strong price cost discipline and effectively manage through continuing chip supply constraints. That focus paid off in growth but also with very strong EBITDA margin expansion. Margins exceeded the high end of our guidance by 130 basis points. This delivered on our previous commitment to significantly improve our margins in the second half of this year. Strong organic revenue growth and accretive margins drove third quarter earnings well above expectations, with earnings per share of $0.79. As you all know, our key end markets have consistently been resilient in the face of macroeconomic headwinds and we expect that underlying demand pattern to continue. M&CS orders continue to be very strong. Water Infrastructure was up solidly. Backlogs continue to be up sharply year-over-year and the digital solutions proportion of our backlogs continue to expand. That said, some of our smaller end markets are more cyclical, such as residential within our Applied Water segment. Orders in those markets were down in the quarter and are expected to remain soft. Looking forward, we anticipate the demand dynamics of the third quarter to continue into 2023. On supply, especially chip supply, the outlook remains consistent with what we said last quarter. As expected, we have not seen meaningful easing of chip supply constraints. But forecasting visibility has improved, as has the reliability of deliveries. We expect to exit the year as we've outlined before. Things are gradually improving. Given the resilience of our demand profile, the vitality of our business and the team's strong operational track record in this environment, we are raising our full year guidance. We now expect full year adjusted earnings per share to be between $2.65 to $2.75 on organic revenue growth between 9% and 10%. In a few minutes, we'll discuss dynamics in our different end markets, along with some trends we're seeing through the current cycle. I'll also touch on how we're serving communities as they invest to become more resilient in the face of intensifying water challenges. But first, let me hand it over to Sandy to offer you some more detail on the third quarter. Thanks, Sandy. In our last quarter's earnings call, we impact how demand in different end markets respond to macroeconomic headwinds. What we described then is what we're seeing in the marketplace now with healthy underlying demand in our largest end markets. Those patterns have repeated over past economic cycles. So they inform how we manage our operations in an environment like this one. Since all water is local, we experienced those patterns and trends playing out at a community level. What we're seeing is more and more communities selling increasing impact from climate change. They're finding their aging infrastructure isn't up to the task and then confronting the economic anxiety of major upgrades. So communities are investing both in short-term response and in longer-term resilience. Infrastructure investment is the much bigger driver of underlying demand. But our customers have to know we will also be there in near-term crisis which are happening all too frequently. For example, when Hurricane Ian hit Florida, our dewatering pumps were already in place ahead of the storm to prevent the worst and recover fast. And storms are the only immediate needs. One Southeastern U.S. city called us with sewer lines leaching waste into community groundwater and their aging pipes are on the brink of collapse. Within days of that call, we were building [indiscernible] that will help that city's wastewater treatment running without interruption, while they make long-term repairs. Helping communities respond to shocks is a fundamental part of our mission. But the more durable value is in helping communities build the strength to withstand future water challenges and economic stresses. Xylem Solutions like advanced metering infrastructure, wastewater network optimization and municipal water recycling, amongst so many others, provide much more than compelling economics. They deliver game-changing resilience. With AMI as an example, cities can cut off water in the event of storm damage, respond instantly to customer crisis and even promote conservation through periods of scarcity and drought. And all of that additional capability costs a city less than their conventional meter networks. That value equation isn't unique to AMI. It's a hallmark of digital solutions across our Xylem portfolio, greater resilience and capability delivered far more affordably than conventional approaches. Those benefits are so important to our customers that we have been steadily extending digital capability into every part of our portfolio. The mini water crisis making headlines in recent months make it clear that the effects of climate change are already driving rapid increases in cost at the community level. To attack the problem at its source, more and more cities are making net zero emissions commitments. Our opportunity is to help water utilities reduce their own carbon footprint. More than 80 leading utilities around the world have already set net zero targets. Last month at Webtech which is one of the largest water trade events each year, we shared research showing how utilities can dramatically cut their emissions while boosting operational efficiency at the same time. The message is good for our customers, good for communities and good for our business. With existing technologies, you can reduce emissions quickly at low cost or even saving money. I am so proud of the team for leading the way on this topic with our customers and our communities. Several of my Xylem colleagues will be speaking at the upcoming COP27 climate meetings in Egypt later this month, to promote the discussion of water which we believe is the most important topic of our time. Now, I'll turn it back over to Sandy to provide detail on our increased guidance and outlook for the year. Thanks, Sandy. I'm very proud of the team's performance overall. We delivered strong results this past quarter by continuing to do what we said we would do. And indeed, the team overdelivered, thanks to our commercial momentum and operational discipline. Even in an environment of macro uncertainty, the durability of our business model and the discipline of our team gives us great confidence in our continued growth and significant value creation over the long run. Before we turn the call over to your questions, I'd like to share a couple of executive appointments we've just made, adding even further strength to Xylem's leadership bench. Earlier, I referred to our strategy of extending digital capabilities across Xylem's product, solutions and services portfolio. We've just taken an important step in accelerating that process, appointing Xylem's first Chief Digital Officer. [Indiscernible] joined our senior leadership team last week, bringing extensive experience of growing digital businesses in the industrial sector. He'll be working with the team to further build out a simple powerful platform of digitized solutions for our customers and communities. He joins us in Danaher and I look forward to introducing him to you in future conversations. Before sharing our second recent appointment, I first want to recognize a colleague many of you know. Tony Milando our Chief Supply Chain Officer, has been looking for to retirement for a while but he graciously agreed to stay on while helping us guide the company through the challenges of the pandemic. He's built agility and durability into our supply chain, put safety and sustainability at the center of our operations and created a culture of continuous improvement that has made operational excellence a core part of Xylem's competitive advantage. We're finally letting Tony retire but his contributions will continue to benefit our stakeholders for many years to come. To build on the foundation of excellence that Tony has laid, we've appointed [indiscernible] Xylem's Chief Operations and Supply Chain Officer. Tom joined us next week coming from Generac Power Systems and he brings 20-plus years of experience leading global supply chains and operations in the industrial and services sectors. We're very pleased to welcome Tom at a time when supply chain and operations continue to be a foundation of competitive advantage. His remit is to take our operational excellence to the next level. Tony is going to stay on for a brief time to give him a good start and ensure a smooth transition. So with that, operator, let's now open it up for Q&A. Thank you, Deane. Happy to have him on board and with mixed emotions to see Tony move on. But yes, it's been a great run. -- for sure. And Deane, I would just offer that coming into this quarter, like we did this past our Applied Water backlog is up almost at least a month or more normally than what we would have visibility to. That's because of supply chain constraints -- we're going to -- and demand. We're going to see that begin to work off in Q4 going into Q1. And so Applied Water will normalize down to its historical levels which is still going to be attractive at very attractive margins. But where you're really going to see the strength come through continued is in the Water Infrastructure resilience because of utility demand and again, the conversion of chip supply on M&CS and given the deals that we've gotten back on. And I think, Nate, I would just offer on the M&CS side, specifically, AMI deals. Again, these are long lead time negotiated regulatory approval deals. They've got great economics associated with them. And I think our customers understand that we're operating in a fairly high inflationary environment and they understand. And they understand that we're being very transparent with them, around what the inflation impact goes in us and that we're being responsible and disciplined. And the economics of these deals are so important to them that right now, the most important thing we can do is just continue to get chips and get the meters installed. And the good news is we've not seen any cancellations of those deals and backlog. So we feel good. We wish we had more chips, of course. But again, these projects require multiyear planning and utilities don't tend to go backwards on these deals. Yes. So as you know, Mike, the -- so roughly 70% of our demand in utilities is OpEx. So it's repair replacement, very stable. If anything, right now, I would say it's probably overcharged because of just aging infrastructure and climate change. So we're seeing really strong growth there. CapEx which is the 30% roughly and this is a global number, not just the U.S. That's the one that we do keep close eye on throughout cycles. And as you know, what we've tended to see is the one driver that can lead to a reduction in CapEx spend historically if we were to see it which we've not seen it yet. I mean our frontline right -- our frontlog right now is very strong. the bidding pipeline is very strong right now. But if we were to see a slowdown in muni-tax receipts, if we were to see a slowdown prolonged in residential expansion in the U.S., those things tend to be later cycle, so it'd be a couple of years down the road. We're not seeing it right now, Mike but that's what we would look for -- on -- and that's on the wastewater side. Now historically, even during the past recessions around the world, if you set aside dewatering for a moment which does tend to be more short cycle and we diversified that part of the business away from kind of pure mining, oil and gas were much more in the muni space now and broader industrial space. But we would see it there. We haven't seen it. And we would ultimately see maybe a low single-digit kind of water infrastructure growth if we were to see a recession but we've not seen that in our frontlogs at this point in time. So we're keeping a close eye on it and we're trying to be responsible and prudent in our planning here. Sure. Yes. So as you said, Scott, we've got a really strong balance sheet. I mean we've got $2 billion liquidity. We got probably firepower of north of $4 billion. We're not going to hesitate if the opportunity presents itself. Pipeline remains really robust. It's a combination of larger opportunities. But we've got a number of small, medium-sized opportunities that are out there, mainly in the utilities space but also in the industrial services space. And so we're going to continue to be disciplined. As you well know, it always takes two to tango. But nothing's changed in our view on valuations and our discipline in that space. Sure. That's a great question, Joe. So digital is certainly not new. So we've got a great foundation that we've already built, both organically as well as through a number of the acquisitions we've done. So [indiscernible] comes in really building on that solid foundation. We are continuing to look at the opportunity to both build internally which is really as much about talent capability, commercializing, selling those opportunities. But our pipeline from an M&A standpoint is still very much focused on adding other solutions and technologies to the mix. And I look forward to having [indiscernible] join us on one of our upcoming calls and share his perspective on what he sees and the opportunities in front of us. But it's a combination, Joe, between organic and M&A. And Joe, I would just add that one of the things that we've not really punctuated in the past is as we were going through the redesign of our chips to be able to help support our customers through this challenging time to move these installations along, there were costs that we added in our P&L to support that. At the same time, we had to redirect some engineering resources away from classic productivity, continuous improvement. So we're working through that. But despite that, you see the margin expansion that we've laid out in the quarter and that we expect for the year and that we expect to win the next year. So I just want to make sure we're making strategic choices here to take care of our customers, not just for the future, for the long run but like right now because that's the value they expect from us. And we continue, Joe, to make investments in innovation and R&D within that segment also within Water Infrastructure. I know M&CS has kind of gotten more the headline over the last few years. But we continue to make increases in R&D spend in those segments because that kind of refreshment of our offerings and portfolio, we see and our new products that we bring to market that they've got much higher margin and growth rates than what they're replacing. So it's important to note that there's a refresh that continues to go on in both of those segments. Sure. So we feel good about the trend lines on demand. And again, that goes back to the question around what our frontlogs look like in terms of bidding pipeline, whether that be AMI, whether that be treatment which is a precursor for wastewater demand and we see healthy demand within our channel partners, even on the Applied Water side. So it is really a year-over-year comp issue. If you look at our orders year-to-date, we're still up 7% year-to-date and it really is a tough comp in the third quarter. I would say that, again, it varies by end market. We've obviously -- we haven't talked China, for example. China is 7% of our revenue. China was up 10% in the third quarter on revenue. But I would say that the public utility funding there in China has been pushed to the right because of the lockdown restrictions there. But we still expect there to be a recovery in utilities but it's probably not going to be until later next year. And there is no change in our long-term plan or outlook on China. But it's a meaningful part of our revenue and we've overcome that with demand across the rest of the portfolio. So the fundamentals are there. We are watching all the signs. We've got our KPIs that we track, especially in our short-cycle businesses. We have seen some moderation, as Sandy said earlier, in Residential which is a very small part of our business. We've seen some slowdown in a couple of other small pieces of our business. So we'll keep a close eye on it. I mean we're not out of the woods yet. But even in commercial, the ABI, the Architectural Billing Index, is still strong at north of 50. And when it's north of 50, that indicates strength in that part of our segment which we continued to see growth in. But again, we're keeping a close eye on all this, Andy. I would just add Andy, that the thing -- when we say customers and dewatering, there's the part that we handle direct, where we have our rental fleet and then there are our channel partners that we actually replenish their fleet and then they have their own rental fleet. And in the past, the part of that business that can turn very quickly is if our channel partners that are all local around the U.S. predominantly, if they get nervous and they see things, they then pull back on replenishing their fleet and that can happen very short cycle. And so we are in regular calls with them to get a feel for how they're feeling about the general macro economy right now. Thus far, it's strong and resilient but that's the area that we would keep a very close eye on. Yes. And I think, Brian, the other -- I mean, regionally, the 2 areas that I would say that we're just seeing things playing out a little bit differently this year than we have in the past. I mentioned earlier, things shifting to the right in China. And again, we have the uncertainties in Europe. And so we just think it's prudent to build that into our outlook for Q4. Is that specifically for Applied Water? I mean we look at that part of our portfolio as market growth itself is GDP on a global basis. And we always look to and have historically beat that by some share gain. And that comes through investments in innovation through R&D. We continue to refresh the portfolio. But to Sandy's point, we're coming off of elevated backlogs due to one demand but also supply chain constraints. We'll see that normalize as we go into 2023. And in our upcoming call, we'll lay out by segment what our outlook is for '23. We are still early in the conversion of large utilities across the U.S. to AMI let alone the smaller- to medium-sized utilities. So that's why the front log, the bidding pipeline looks so attractive across the market and that's why we remain confident. But these are long-term deals that take a while to negotiate and we're pleased with our position. Well, thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning and for your continued interest and support. Really appreciate it. I know between now and the next earnings call, we'll have a chance to meet with many of you in person. Between now and then, stay safe and safe travels. Look forward to seeing you. Thank you."

Now, please turn to slide three, and I will turn the call over to our CEO, Patrick Decker\nPatrick Decker: Thanks Andrea and good morning, everyone. We're pleased to report that the team delivered a very strong second quarter performance on all key metrics and well ahead of our guidance. But the result builds on the momentum and underlying demand we saw in the first quarter with disciplined operational execution on strong fundamentals and a moderate easing in chip supply constraints. Revenues grew 6% organically, surpassing our guide. The team's commercial performance was outstanding in all segments and supply improvements in M&CS and Water Infrastructure enabled increased conversion of orders into revenue. Geographically, the growth was broad-based, Western Europe was up 9%, and North America at 6%, and emerging markets, excluding China, was up double-digits. While China was down due to COVID lockdowns, backlogs continue to grow on underlying demand. In addition to organic revenue growth, the team posted 6% orders growth. That orders momentum reflects strong performance across each segment. Water Infrastructure set the strongest base, growing orders 21% in the quarter. Our backlogs were up sharply versus last year, with digital solutions comprising more than half the total backlog. EBITDA margin also came in well-ahead of our guidance. We delivered strong quarter-on-quarter expansion driven by disciplined execution. All of that good work delivered earnings per share of $0.66, which soundly beat our expectations. As you can see, some incremental improvement in chip supply came earlier than anticipated, and it had a strong positive impact on the quarter. To be clear, we don't believe chip supply will improve much more quickly than previously expected. What we are seeing is a gradual improvement in supply, which provides further confidence in our second half outlook. The team also delivered pricing actions to mitigate inflation across all segments, and I want to give a big shout out to the entire team, including our distribution and channel partners for managing through a dynamic market environment. We combine those disciplined actions with productivity savings from simplifying the way we work and entirely offset inflation in the quarter. We expect demand to remain resilient due to the essential nature of the services our customers need from us. So as you've seen in this morning's release, we are raising our organic revenue guidance to 8% to 10% growth for the full year, and we're raising the bottom end of our EPS range by $0.10. We'll come back and discuss our full review of the macro environment in a few minutes, but let me hand it over now to Sandy for some additional color on the second quarter.\nSandy Rowland: Thanks, Patrick. Please turn to slide 4. The team did a tremendous job over delivering on our commitments with disciplined execution on strong fundamentals and continuing demand. As a result, revenues grew globally high single digits in Western Europe and mid-single digits in the US. In emerging markets, revenue grew low double digits, excluding China, which was slowed by ongoing COVID restrictions. In a moment, I'll detail performance by segment. But in short, utilities was up 2%, led by strength in Western Europe and the US. Industrial grew 12% on increasing activity in all geographies, particularly the US, Western Europe and Latin America. Commercial was down 1%, strength in Western Europe was offset by continued US supply chain challenges. And residential was up 13%, led by commercial execution and backlog conversion in the US. Organic orders were up 6% in the quarter, with water infrastructure up 21% and AWS up 2%, partially offset by M&CS. Global demand continues to be strong, and our book-to-bill ratio was a healthy 1.2 in the quarter. EBITDA margin was 16.6%, well-above our guided range, and that reflects a 240 basis point rise sequentially on strong commercial execution and discipline on discretionary costs. Price contributed two points of incremental revenue growth sequentially. As Patrick mentioned, pricing and productivity benefits combined more than offset inflation, and our EPS in the quarter was $0.66, coming in above expectations. Please turn to slide 5, and I'll review the quarter's segment performance in a bit more detail. Water Infrastructure revenue exceeded expectations, growing 9% organically in the quarter. Industrial remained strong, driven by continued backlog conversion, and our US wastewater utility business grew double digits as supply chain constraints improved throughout the quarter. Geographically, the US and Western Europe were also up double digits, driven by robust transport demand in the US and treatment applications in Western Europe, alongside strong dewatering growth. Emerging markets, excluding China, was up high single-digits, driven by strength across Latin America and Africa. These markets were down mid-single digits, including China, due to COVID site access restrictions there. Orders in the second quarter were up 21% organically versus last year, with growth underpinned by strong underlying demand supported by large infrastructure projects in the US and Canada. We also saw sustained demand in our wastewater utility business in North America and Western Europe. EBITDA margin for the segment was up 240 basis points as strong price realization, volume and productivity benefits more than offset inflation and investments. Please turn to Page 6. In the applied water segment, second quarter organic revenues grew 7%, modestly exceeding our expectations. Geographically, the US was up high single-digits with strength across industrial and residential, partially offset by supply chain constraints in the commercial business. Western Europe delivered low double-digit growth with healthy gains across all end markets, led by benefits from new energy-efficient product introductions. Emerging markets was up low single-digits, driven by strong industrial demand. Orders were up 2% organically and continued to outpace revenue with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.1 for the quarter. Segment's EBITDA margin declined 130 basis points compared to the prior year. And while price realization more than offset inflation, volume and mix for the quarter were negative. Despite lower volumes, demand remains robust as seen in our book-to-bill ratio. However, we expect to continue to deliver sequential EBITDA improvement as the benefit of pricing actions comes through our backlog. And now let's turn to Slide 7, and I'll cover our Measurement & Control Solutions business. M&CS exceeded expectations on strong demand and modestly better chip supply with revenue declining 2% organically. We also saw strong growth in our test and pipeline assessment services product lines. Geographically, the US and Western Europe were down mid-single digits and emerging markets was up high single-digits. M&CS orders declined 9% organically in the quarter, due to lapping some large deals in North America and the UK. Underlying demand for our AMI offering remains strong and orders continue to outpace revenue. We recorded a book-to-bill ratio of 1.4 and has built a backlog of over $2 billion. Segment EBITDA margin in the quarter was ahead of expectations, expanding 120 basis points sequentially on improved volumes. As supply chain stability improves and we convert our backlog, we will see strong margin accretion on higher volumes as we have previously discussed. And now let's turn to Slide 8 for an overview of cash flows and our balance sheet. In the second quarter, we generated free cash flow of $67 million, driven by income conversion, partially offset by higher working capital. Our financial position remains strong with $1.1 billion in cash and $1.9 billion of available liquidity. Net debt-to-EBITDA leverage is 1.5 times. Please turn to Slide 9, and I'll hand the call back to Patrick to look forward at the rest of the year.\nPatrick Decker: Thanks, Sandy. As you've seen, the team is delivering strong results in a very dynamic environment. Given the prominence of discussions about macro uncertainty in the economy, it's worth spending a few minutes talking about our confidence in the resilience of underlying demand for Xylem's offerings. The aspect of our sector and our business model that gets most discussed in this context and for good reason is that, our offering is at the core of essential services through the ups and downs of economic cycles. Cities and towns must provide essential water and wastewater services. So, the demand associated with water management tends to be quite resilient. It's also important to understand the dynamics between OpEx versus CapEx across economic cycles, particularly for water utilities. OpEx spending is very stable, given the basic need for day-to-day water services, CapEx which represents roughly a-third of spending on Xylem's offerings is focused on infrastructure expansion, or refurbishment, and it comes with longer regulatory and funding approvals. So spending against these projects once approved, historically, has not wavered to a material extent. And this is not just a US dynamic, but it applies globally. You see it in Europe, both at the regional level. For example, with the EU's recovery and resilience funding, and at the country level as seen in the UK's AMP process. Similarly, infrastructure funding is embedded in China's five-year planning cycle. And of course, you're all familiar with the recent US federal infrastructure funding and the time lines on which the state revolving funds work. Those structural advantages of the sector, however, are only a benefit, if our portfolio delivers distinctive value to our customers through the cycle. For many of our customers, value is defined in terms of becoming more efficient. And that means modernizing their infrastructure, with digital technologies, to make their networks more affordable. Our AMI metrology backlogs offer a proof point about the resilience of that demand. Despite the ongoing chip supply challenges that have dogged the tech sector for the last year, our backlogs have continued to grow. Our distinctive data and communications driven AMI solutions, deliver a step change in both efficiency and resilience for utilities. AMI represents now roughly a-third of all water meters in the US, which shows the progress of adoption, but also the potential for future growth. Given the budgetary pressures the utility face, both to generate revenue and reduce water loss, smart meters will remain a top imperative. One other demand trend that will persist through the cycle and in fact, is set to increase is the growing response to climate change. Cities around the world are committing to net zero emissions. At the same time, they are investing in mitigating the impacts of climate change that are already here, like those, we've seen this summer in the form of historic and tragic flooding in the US and Asia. These are generational challenges. Innovations and new approaches are absolutely essential to solving them, because water management is a significant carbon contributor, accounting for up to 10% of greenhouse gas emissions globally. In commercial and residential markets, cities have begun introducing building regulations to reduce emissions, including efficient water management standards for both regional construction and retrofits, and the utility market, which produces greenhouse gas emissions, equal to the entire global shipping industry. It's going to be required to reduce its carbon intensity in line with the commitments of their cities, municipalities and countries. And we at Xylem are an outright leader in this space and are in a unique position to support our customers in their sustainability commitments. You may have seen that we released our annual sustainability report in May. Among all the progress made against our 2025 goals, I'd highlight that we enabled our customers to reduce their carbon footprint by 730,000 metric tons in 2021 alone using our technology. That is the equivalent of taking 160,000 cars off the road. And we're on track to help them reduce their emissions by 2.8 million metric tons by 2025. So stepping back, we're very confident that the macro force is driving our underlying demand will continue. We're also confident that Xylem is better positioned than ever to create value by helping our customers respond to them. So now, I'll turn it back over to Sandy for more detail and color on our outlook and guide.\nSandy Rowland: Thanks, Patrick. Consistent with our previous presentations, we've provided key facts for each end market in the appendix. The outlook across our end markets has broadly improved. We expect healthy underlying demand will continue through the remainder of the year, with improved price/cost mix and modest improvements in supply chain. We now expect our utility business to grow mid-single digits, up from low single digits. On the wastewater side, we now expect mid-single-digit growth, up from low to mid-single-digit growth on improved backlog conversion and resilient global demand. The outlook for longer-term capital project spending and bid activity remains solid globally. For clean water utilities, we now expect mid-single-digit growth up from flat. The main driver is earlier than expected easing of chip supply constraints. Although, supply has improved, lead times continue to remain elevated, and our volumes continue to be constrained. We also expect momentum in our test and pipeline assessment services business to continue, due to increasing focus in our end markets on infrastructure and climate challenges, as evidenced by our strong backlog. Please turn to slide 11. Looking at the industrial end market, we now expect high single-digit to low double-digit growth, up from mid-single-digit growth and increased activity in the US and Europe and strong global demand for our solutions. We continue to expect the commercial end market to deliver mid-single to high single-digit growth on solid replacement activity and new introductions in the US and Europe. In residential, our smallest end market, we now expect healthy demand to drive double-digit growth, up from mid-single digits. As a reminder, the majority of our commercial and residential end market exposure is replacement driven versus new construction. Now let's turn to slide 12, and I'll walk you through our updated guidance. Our outperformance in the second quarter gives us confidence to increase our full year guidance for organic revenue growth and to raise the low end of the adjusted EPS range. We now expect full year organic revenue growth of 8% to 10%, up from 4% to 6%, and we have raised the bottom end of our EPS range by $0.10. The increase in the reported revenue guidance is more modest, as the strength of the dollar offsets roughly half of our operational improvements. We have modified our assumptions on our basket of currency exposure, which is included in the appendix. These changes result in an incremental $0.05 headwind to the full year EPS guide. And this is on top of a $0.10 EPS FX headwind that we discussed last quarter. On slide 13, we've shown how our guidance breaks down by segment. We now expect high single-digit growth in Water Infrastructure, up from mid-single digits and low double-digit growth in Applied Water, up from high single digits, driven by disciplined commercial execution and backlog conversion on continued strong demand in both segments. We now expect Measurement & Control Solutions to be up mid-single digits, up from flat. This reflects the outperformance in the first half from chip supply improving sooner than expected. For 2022, we are raising the bottom end of our adjusted EBITDA margin range, which is now 16.5% to 17% and this yields the adjusted EPS range of $2.50 to $2.70 that I just mentioned. We now expect free cash flow conversion to be approximately 90% of net income. We're carrying about a month of extra inventory to mitigate the risk of supply chain disruptions and provide continuity of service to our customers.  We expect to bring conversion back to historical levels as supply chain stabilize, enabling us to return to free cash flow conversion of at least 100%. We have provided you with a number of other full year assumptions on the slide to supplement your models. And now drilling down on the third quarter, we anticipate total company organic revenues will be up 10% to 12%. This includes mid-single-digit growth in Water infrastructure and mid-double-digit growth in Applied Water and M&CS. We expect third quarter adjusted EBITDA margin to be in the range of 16.5% to 17%, a sequential improvement over the prior quarter.  And with that, please turn to Slide 14, and I'll turn the call back over to Patrick for closing comments.\nPatrick Decker: Thanks, Sandy. We saw the power, some short-term swings this past quarter. A small improvement in chip supply had a big impact. Currency movements have been offering what you could call a challenging forecasting environment and the unexpected duration of COVID shutdowns held China back.  Just a quick note on China, our team and our customers there have been continuing to serve their communities under very tough conditions, given the extensive restrictions in place to manage COVID, I'm incredibly proud of the team. We expect to see progressive improvement in the market for the second half and have full confidence China will continue to be a source of innovation and growth for the long run. In the context of short-term uncertainty, our job is demanded through the unexpected. Meeting those challenges is what being a good operator is all about and the team has certainly been doing that. The team's strong operational execution is built on the same foundation as our 2025 growth and strategic milestones, a consistent story at the heart of our investment thesis. We're building on our leadership position as a technology company with a durable business model. We're benefiting from long-term secular trends of rising demand, driven by water and climate-related challenges. We're driving above-market growth and margin expansion as we digitize our portfolio to serve our customers' imperative to be more efficient. We're successfully putting sustainability at the center of everything we do, across our company, our customers and our communities. And we'll create additional stakeholder value with disciplined capital allocation as opportunity is won. Strong continued demand and the kind of performance we're seeing from the Xylem team show our ability to deliver on that thesis. And with that, operator, let's open it up for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is coming from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nDeane Dray: Thank you. Good morning everyone.\nPatrick Decker : Good morning, Deane.\nSandy Rowland: Good morning, Deane.\nDeane Dray: Hey, maybe we can start with the better news on the chip supply. And we've been hearing that from other manufacturers that it's starting to improve gradually, and your commentary is pretty consistent with that. But just some additional color, what you see in the quarter? And what's that outlook for the second half? How much of the backlog in digital might you be able to sell?\nSandy Rowland: Yes. Good morning, Deane. Thanks for the question. We certainly were pleased to see definitely slightly better supply throughout the quarter. And I think if you go back to where we were from a low point from a revenue perspective, last year in Q4, we're under $300 million of revenue. We clawed that back and we're approaching 350 in the second quarter. So it was definitely a bigger step-up than we had anticipated. As we look at the second half of the year Deane, we see a more modest increase from Q2 to Q3, and then a little more -- another step-up into Q4. We think we're going to exit the year really in line with what we had modeled. We've just been benefiting from some better supply earlier in the year. And I give credit to the team that has been in really close contact with all of our key suppliers leaning in and also being opportunistic in the spot market so that we could take care of our customers.\nPatrick Decker: And I would just add Deane that \u2013 sorry, for my voice that in addition to that the team has done terrific work not just on landing chips in the spot market, but a lot of the redesign work that we talked about in past quarters is nearing completion. And so there was an added cost in the quarter for that, but it was there to really make sure we secured supply for our customers. And we also shipped out more mechanical meters in the interim in order to bridge that gap while we're waiting on the chip to come through. So there were multiple dynamics, but as Sandy laid out things certainly got better and we feel more confident now about the second half than we did before.\nDeane Dray: That's real helpful. And just the context of this and I'm not sure if you can give specific numbers, but our expectation is that the profitability of these digitally enhanced products and services they're roughly 50% more profitable than the legacy I don't want to say dumb, but not digitally enabled products and services. Is it still that magnitude of difference in margins on the digital side?\nSandy Rowland: Yes. Deane, the margins are clearly richer on the digital side. And we saw that in our mix in M&CS in the quarter. We were about 5% less digital this year compared to last year. And I think that was with the purpose of taking care of our customers and putting product into the hands of our customers where -- to keep them up and going. And so that took a more mechanical meaning this time around. I think as we look at longer-term where we expect to land from a margin perspective nothing has changed structurally from what we laid out in our Investor Day last year in September.\nPatrick Decker : If anything gained the backlog has gotten stronger, especially with some of the large deals that we brought in over the last few quarters and the bidding pipeline remains very robust just given how early we still are in terms of conversion to MI across, especially the US on the water side of things. So we expect that runway to be there for quite some time.\nDeane Dray: Got it. And then just last question for Sandy, on the free cash flow, we've seen most of the companies this earnings season trimming free cash flow guidance, all because of higher working capital commitments both supply chain inefficiencies and big demand. Just -- how do you -- the expectation for returning to 100% free cash flow, is that really dependent on the supply chain? And what would be the time frame?\nSandy Rowland: Yeah. I think a great question, Deane. When we built our plan for 2022, we expected that supply chains would be meaningful -- meaningfully improved in the second half of the year. And we're not seeing big changes yet. And therefore we think it's prudent to carry some extra inventory with the leaning of delivering on revenue and delivering on our backlog. So there's, a couple of things that are going on. Lead times are still elongated. We're still having problems where we're missing one or two key components and then we're not able to get the entire solution out the door. And of course inflation is bringing up the overall balances in our inventory. But we will bring that down. We'd expect that is certainly in 2023 at the latest and it will be a key focus item for our teams. This is not something that we plan to do for a long period of time.\nPatrick Decker: And from a segment perspective Deane, it was most notable in Applied Water, where again we've had continued knock-on effects whether be supply chain casings coming out of China due to COVID. Obviously, we expect those to continue somewhat in the second half. And that's why to Sandy's point we brought in an extra month of inventory into that business. So it's very visible. We know exactly what it is. It's totally under control. It's simply a matter of meaning to do that in order to supply customers and maintain that demand.\nDeane Dray: All right. That was great color. Thank you.\nPatrick Decker: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Nathan Jones with Stifel. Your line is open.\nNathan Jones: Good morning everyone.\nPatrick Decker: Good morning, Nathan.\nSandy Rowland: Good morning, Nath.\nNathan Jones: Going back to M&CS, I think Dan asked enough questions on the chip supply and how that's progressing. Maybe you could talk a little bit about the expected profitability of that business as we see revenue pick up in the third quarter, and then you've talked about a bigger step-up in the fourth quarter, assuming that it's probably going to continue to improve going into next year. Can you talk about the path to getting back to those profitability targets that you laid out at the Investor Day? Where might we be able to get to in 2023? How quickly can you get to that kind of expected margin level on the business?\nSandy Rowland: Yeah. I think obviously a really important question, Nath. I think one thing I want to call out is we've already seen from the low point in Q4, 300 basis points of margin expansion from Q4 to Q2. And that's evolving because of the higher volumes, partially constrained by some of the things that we referenced earlier in the call the mechanical mix the redesign costs on optimal manufacturing flows. But as we look out into the back half of the year, there's not as much of a pickup from a revenue perspective, but we would expect margins to kind of continue along the same trajectory that we've recognized from Q4 Q to Q2. And I'm not going to give guidance on 2023 on this call. But as we look out to 2024, 2025 we don't see anything structurally different about where margins should land in that time period.\nNathan Jones: Okay. My follow-up is Europe and Industrial. One of the biggest concerns we hear from investors is Europe and industrial not only are you not seeing that. I think that was one of the stronger areas in terms of growth in the quarter and solid orders there. Maybe you can talk about the trends that you're seeing there? And then, if you can talk about the resilience of the industrial business in general, particularly the lot industrial side of the business, and how you would expect that to react in the potential for a recession in Europe?\nSandy Rowland: Yeah. I think for us Europe has been a real bright spot. And it's not just in one segment. It's really across the entire portfolio. We've seen good revenues in Europe. We've seen good orders. I know, there's a lot of concern about potential recession in Europe, and the industrial market in particular. I think one thing, I would call out is that, if you look at our dewatering business, for example, which is more industrial, we've done a lot to diversify the end markets there, much less exposure to oil and gas than we did in the prior recession. I think we're down to about 1% revenue in that end market. And then, of course, there we've also been diversifying from a geographic perspective.\nPatrick Decker: Again, I would just offer up, Nathan, you publicly recall this, but if you go back over time, and look at previous kind of industrial recessions back in kind of the 2015, 2016 timeframe, our European business still held up in terms of growth during that timeframe, because the results are much less cyclical there given the end market exposure that we've got. And also \u2013 so for example, I think the numbers in 2016, Europe still grew 3% despite being in the middle of an industrial recession.\\ So, we feel pretty good about that. We think it would be that resilient again. I think as you well know, if we were to first see any softening in orders which we've not seen to this point, it would be \u2013 it would be in our short-cycle businesses, which would be more applied water and dewater. And again, we've not seen that yet. Our backlog continues to grow good book-to-bill, and again, obviously there would be actions that we would take, if we began to see those metrics coming through, as we've done in the past. We can phase investments. We still have further productivity opportunities to go after across the organization, and we're sitting on record backlogs. And the fact that, we've been able to weather the chip supply issue, without losing any business, and those deals and backlog is pretty strong statement about the resilience of our pipeline and the markets that we serve.\nNathan Jones: Thanks for taking my questions. I\u2019ll pass it on.\nPatrick Decker: Thank you\nOperator: We will take our next question from Connor Lynagh with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nConnor Lynagh: Yeah. Thanks. Just wanted to talk a little bit about cash flow and capital allocation. So, on the cash flow side, your full year free cash flow guidance does seem to anticipate some pretty good relief on working capital investment in the back half. I'm just thinking through, it looks like you have a CapEx acceleration. Obviously, we can sort of get to the EBITDA number. So \u2013 is that because you think that you will be starting to work down inventories, or is that just sort of a seasonal release in working capital that you're anticipating?\nSandy Rowland: Yes. No. Great question. We do have a plan to start working down some of our inventory through the back half of the year. It's nothing dramatic. It's going to take place over the next six months on a very gradual basis. And I think we are \u2013 our teams have been doing a good job on the elements around working capital. We are going to continue to lean in hard on collections, and make sure we bring those in, and that \u2013 we've seen really good results through the pandemic on our collection front. And similarly, we're doing work around, getting better terms from a payable perspective. I may have referenced it on another call. We have a supply chain financing program that's quite active, and it allows our supplier base to take advantage of our credit rating. We're getting more of our supplier base engaged on that program, and that will give us some incremental days from a payables perspective. And I think, it all ties into being prudent also around cost and discretionary spend, and CapEx spend to make sure, we start seeing a better cash conversion in the second half, which lines up with our historical seasonality as well.\nConnor Lynagh: Makes sense. And then, I was noticing, it looks like you slowed your cadence of buybacks in the quarter. Is that driven by any concern around the state of the business? Is it because you're starting to see more opportunities emerge on M&A? Just any color on what you're thinking there?\nSandy Rowland: Yeah. So we haven't changed our strategy, our capital allocation strategy. We've typically bought stock back in the first quarter, which is when we have a vesting date in our equity compensation programs. And so this was nothing that we bought back stock in Q1. We wrapped that up at \u2013 in the March time frame. And as we look at our M&A funnel, and pipeline, we still see a really \u2013 we're really encouraged by the funnel, the range of opportunities, and that remains a higher priority for us than buying back our stock.\nPatrick Decker: Yeah, I would just add to that, if you look at our balance sheet, we've got upwards of about $4 billion in dry powder, and we are not hesitant to do a deal when it needs to be done. But again, that would all be in advanced in serving our strategy that we've laid out. As Sandy said, the pipeline is very active all different sizes of opportunities in that pipeline. But again, we want to continue to be disciplined and selective with an eye towards significant value creation. And again, as I always say it takes two to tango.\nConnor Lynagh: Right. Makes sense. I'll leave that comment for somebody else to ask about. But \u2013 thanks.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Mike Halloran with Baird. Your line is open.\nMike Halloran: Hey, good morning, everyone.\nPatrick Decker: Good morning, Mike.\nSandy Rowland: Good morning, Mike.\nMike Halloran: Many thanks for that. So the \u2013 obviously, you guys seem pretty confident in the underlying trends of the end market. I know, you spent a lot of time talking about the \u2013 your ability to react as things do so here or there. But obviously, backlog is really strong. Maybe you could talk a little bit about how that visibility from the backlog stretches out here? How does that compare to what that normal visibility looks like? And any color you can around how much \u2013 how booked out you are as we get to out years at this point?\nSandy Rowland: Yeah. I think, Mike really good question. Nothing has changed structurally about our backlog. If you look at our AWS business that has a larger book-to-bill ratio than the other segments, and we're carrying record backlogs across really all three of our segments. And we did see really strong book-to-bill ratios across the portfolio in the quarter from an orders perspective. As we look at our water infrastructure and Xylem's M&CS backlogs, they stretch out for longer periods of time. Water infrastructure is in the middle. We have our transport business, which turns fairly quickly and a treatment business that has projects that stand out for multiple years. And then M&TS is the longest coupled with the supply chain constraints, which don't magically disappear at any one month, we have a $2 billion backlog there. So that's going to take a couple of years plus to work to work through.\nMike Halloran: Appreciate that. And then the price cost cadence sequential improvement catching up on the price side relative to the inflation pressures. How does that work in the back half of the year on an EBITDA dollar basis when you think your whole? What do you think margins start reflecting the positive pricing you're putting through?\nSandy Rowland: Yes. I mean, we are really pleased with what we saw from a price perspective. We've leaned in harder on price, because inflation is also coming in higher throughout the year. A big milestone we did get price cost positive in the quarter from a dollar perspective, given the magnitude it's slightly dilutive to the rate in Q2. Q3 is a little bit lower from a seasonality -- a little bit lower on the revenue side compared to Q2 just because of the typical seasonality in our water infrastructure business. And so in Q3, we expect to continue to be price/cost positive on a dollar basis, probably still in the same order of magnitude about 30 basis points this quarter in that order of magnitude dilutive from a rate perspective. And then we think in Q4, we should be positive again from a dollar perspective and neutral from a rate perspective. So, really good progress across the portfolio to reach this important milestone.\nMike Halloran: Thank you. Yes.\nPatrick Decker: If I could just go back to your question on visibility and backlog. I think the other dimension that we feel much better about now than we even did in the last industrial downturn is the visibility and the closest we have to our channel partners, our distribution channel partners both here in the US as well as in Europe, where we have meaningful indirect channel business. And we've got much better visibility and coordination with them now than we did back then. So we got hit with a couple of surprises last time around in a quarter or two, we feel much better about that not happening going forward. So they are also our eyes and ears of what's going on in the marketplace at a local level.\nMike Halloran: Thanks for that Patrick. Thanks, Sandy.\nSandy Rowland: Thanks, Mike.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Scott Davis with Melius Research. Your line is open.\nScott Davis: Hey, good morning everybody.\nPatrick Decker: Hey, good morning, Scott.\nSandy Rowland: Good morning, Scott.\nScott Davis : A couple of little things here. I mean, the supply chain issues, I mean, chips we've been talking about for quite some time, have the other supply chain challenges gotten a lot better the non-chip related stuff getting materials faster easier.\nPatrick Decker: Yes. Scott another great question. It's a mixed bag. I'd say, supply chain in the aggregate has modestly improved versus Q1, but it really does vary across the three segments. So as we mentioned, chip supply getting a bit better within MCS, but lead times are still long but they're not worse, they're getting better. And water infrastructure, we have seen improvement in lead times from our European factory into the US. And certainly, what our infrastructure has benefited over the last year by offering more competitive lead times due to better vertical integration that we did within the company. But then I would say as we mentioned earlier one of the reasons we're carrying an extra month of inventory is because of applied water. It's not limited to ply water but that's the main driver. And that's really again just knock on effects from China mainly castings, but also we see continued delays in shipping and logistics that we're just having to work through. So I'd say, it's getting marginally better across the board, but it really varies by segment. . \nScott Davis: And we talked a little bit about China. I -- how does it work? When you think about their controlled economy like that and their CapEx budgets and how they think about cadencing projects and stuff when you have the lockdowns like you've had this year does it -- does it push the projects to 2023 but then the existing 2023 plan remains and then they try to catch up does everything pushed, right? I mean how does China kind of work?\nPatrick Decker: Sure, yes. So -- and obviously, it's a big market. So it does vary depending upon the vertical -- the end markets that we're talking about. What we find is that the utility side is much more stable. So right now the issue for us has not been so much for our plants not to be up and running. We returned back to, kind of, normal levels in terms of staffing and presence back in May I believe it was. It really though is logistics and transportation have been at a standstill because customers and colleagues are required to be at home. These impact all kinds of projects Scott, but mainly the government-funded projects. But that's not a bad thing because those projects don't go away. They simply shift to the right. And we would see from the past that there would be an accelerated catch-up as the restrictions are lifted. So we've got plenty of capacity in our factories and as to the distribution partners to get this stuff out. It's simply a matter of sites not being open. I mean, customer job sites, utilities not being open. That's what we're waiting to see recovery. We're not assuming that we're going to get much of any recovery in the second half of this year, but we do expect that to recover to come back quite strongly in 2023. But no structural changes in our view on the attractiveness of China. This is simply things moving to the right. \nScott Davis: Okay. That\u2019s really helpful. Best of luck. Thank you.\nPatrick Decker: Thank you.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Brian Lee with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Brain, your line is now open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Yes. Hi. Hello. This is Miguel on for Brian. Just a quick question on the supply chain on the chips. I know a lot has been talked about there, but it sounds like on chip supply it's definitely -- commentary sounds it's improving, but some of your peers have still been kind of been more cautious on the chip supply. Is there anything on the supply side or what you're doing specifically that maybe is helping you out a bit more recently versus peers? \nSandra Rowland: I can't speak for all of our peers. I think, we have been working very -- as we said earlier, working very closely with our suppliers. The trajectory on where we exit the year is very consistent with what we expected. It's been good work to get some better chip supply earlier. And also within M&CS, there have been some other product lines that have been strong as well. It's not only the chips that drove the upside in M&CS. So we're seeing good results from our test business, some traction with our pipeline assessment services business. And so that broader portfolio is also helping us get out ahead of what we had modeled for the year.\nPatrick Decker: The only other thing I would add, which I \u2013 I'm cautious to share too much on this because we've got good visibility but it's not perfect because things could change. But I do think, depending upon who you're including in that peer group, it talks about digital, we've got somewhat higher concentration. Therefore we get a bit more leverage with suppliers. And we've got some really strong relationships with our partners, whether it be the direct suppliers from the chips and wafers or whether it be our partnership with Flex, we aggregate our demand and I think it gives us a stronger platform, at least stronger than what would be if we were doing it all on our own. So some of these things it's also just \u2013 I mean the number of calls that I and others have been on with the leaders of these companies and you just got \u2013 the team has been working it. And we've had to be more patient than we wanted to. But I think those relationships and those investments and relationships are beginning to pay-off.\nUnidentified Analyst: Understood. Thanks a lot. I\u2019ll pass it on. Appreciate the color.\nPatrick Decker: Thank you.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Saree Boroditsky with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nSaree Boroditsky: Good morning. So you highlighted strong growth in dewatering applications across most geographies. Could you talk about the benefit that had on March during the quarter? And should that continue to be a margin tailwind for the remainder of the year? \nSandy Rowland: Yes. So if you look at water infrastructure business sits, we saw a really good margin performance. That business has been the most resilient when we look over the past couple of years. And certainly, the recovery in dewatering is a contributing factor. And so a lot of hard work has gone into our dewatering business both to diversify it from an end market perspective, from a geographic perspective. We've made some purposeful investments in our fleet to make it more modern and current and we're seeing that upside on the rental side as well. So certainly dewatering positive seeing good orders momentum there continue in the quarter on a global basis. So certainly helpful to the margin expansion story with the water infrastructure.\nPatrick Decker: Yes. And I would just add it's \u2013 I mean certainly, it's one of the shorter cycle businesses that we've got and it's not immune to cyclical downturn just like it hits it up on the way up. I think the other area that we benefited from is full on integration within our commercial team, most notably in North America, where I think it's been upgraded and leadership. I think there have been investments that Sandy as talked about. And the diversification has really been away from heavy oil and gas and mining and looking at more utility muni opportunities, where there's visibility with some of our other businesses in the portfolio. So good lead generation by sharing leads with our field services teams. So we're in the early stages of that, but we've had some really good growth rates there. We're up maybe yes double-digit here through the first half of the year on the order side and we hope that continues.\nSaree Boroditsky: Okay. And then obviously, you've talked a lot about MCS and kind of the strong growth outlook there, but organic colors declined in the quarter. So just wondering, do you expect to see orders turn positive again? \nSandy Rowland: I think when orders -- we've had a real surge in orders, over the past several quarters and so while the headline print on orders for MCS may have been negative, when you look at the orders from a dollar perspective, we're still running well ahead of what we're able to convert from a revenue perspective. I think we had $475 million of orders in the quarter, which is still a really good number relative to our revenue. The pipeline continues to be robust. We're still in the early innings of the overall AMI conversion journey. About one-third of the industry has converted to AMI, in North America. So, there's still a lot of runway and we have a really differentiated product there that's gaining traction. \nPatrick Decker: Yes. And I think as we said earlier, I know none of us ever like to be talking about difficult year-over-year comps, when you have big deals in a quarter last year, but it is there is some element of the nature of that in the business. And we'll certainly be even more transparent, going forward as to, how big are those deals, what other big deals are coming because it is a big rich pipeline right now that we're bidding on. And so, we have been running hot for the better part of 1.5 years or so, on some big deals big books. So but we were very positive on that pipeline. \nQ \u2013 Saree Boroditsky: Thanks for taking my question.\nPatrick Decker: Thank you.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Andrew Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Your line is open. \nAndrew Kaplowitz: Good morning, everyone.\nSandy Rowland: Good morning.\nPatrick Decker: Good morning.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Patrick, I said maybe you could talk about, what you're seeing on the municipal water front and how IAG [ph] funding may be starting to flow in. Have you seen any of that funding, yet? And how are you thinking about that moving forward into 2023? . \nPatrick Decker: Yes. No we've really -- we've not seen -- I mean well first of all, we see demand in utilities very robust. And especially here, I mean stable in Europe, good emerging markets obviously ex-China and was really strong in the quarter here in North America. We really have not seen anything meaningful, come through from a funding standpoint, yet. So that would still be upside. And -- we talk a lot about the infrastructure bill here in the US. But as I mentioned in my prepared comments, you've also got the recovery and resilience funding going on in the EU. You've got at the country level in the UK's five-year process, that we talk about. And then you've got the infrastructure funding that's embedded in Sean's five-year planning cycle, which remains unchanged. So all those together, we think really point to a very strong funding infrastructure for utility spend globally.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Got. That's helpful, Patrick. And I know Sandy, you talked about price cost improving. Obviously, you've mentioned productivity in the past. It seems like it's also improving, but maybe you can talk about that how constrained labor is and you're sort of pushing productivity as you go forward and how that impacts the overall price cost dynamic?\nSandy Rowland: Yes. So I think we were price cost positive excluding productivity in the quarter. So that was really encouraging. We have a pipeline of continuous improvement product -- projects that we're driving across the portfolio. Some of that has been a little bit constrained this year, as we've moved engineers off of continuous improvement projects, on to redesign work. As Patrick talked about earlier in the call is that work matures and we move through the sort of the test and certification part of that process, we'll be able to bring some of our resources back and focus on continuous improvement projects and continue to pick up momentum on the productivity front as well. But I think looking across the globe our teams are doing a good job there and it's contributing to our margin improvement story on a quarter sequential basis.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Appreciate it.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Joe Giordano with Cowen. Your line is open\nJoe Giordano: Hey guys. good morning.\nPatrick Decker: Hey good morning.\nSandy Rowland: Hey Joe.\nJoe Giordano: Hey. So, when -- you think when we start -- when this all normalizes on supply chain, you look back at how it went and you think about -- sorry when you think about M&CS like what do you think you're going to come out thinking like this is what we did really well. This is some things that we need to like structurally maybe alter going forward to kind of meet a new reality.\nPatrick Decker: It's a great question. I think right now Joe as -- certainly as I look at it and Sandy can certainly comment here. I think we're going to look back on and say we did quite well is navigating through the chip supply and holding a team together, holding morale, people spending days and nights and weekends over and over and over again on the phone with suppliers. Customers working -- our commercial teams are working with customers keeping them on board. Nobody happy. But the team's fortitude really shown through and it continued to show through. I think two, the fact that there have been no cancellations in a record backlog is a testimony to that. And no decline in the margins of that backlog due to chip supply. Our margins have been impacted by some of the near-term choices we've had to make on spending money on redesigns, on selling some mechanical meters in at lower margin than our other meters. And so those I think are all going to be in the plus column. I think if there were things that we could have done differently the one that comes to mind for me was I think we probably waited a little too long to get going on some of the redesign work. I don't think we missed it by much. But I think we all learned that the sooner you get on that, the better you're going to get because it takes a while to sort through that. So, that would be my high-level takes on this, but we're not out of it yet. So, we still have time to reserve the right to get smarter. \nJoe Giordano: That\u2019s good color. Thank you, Pat. And then maybe I'll ask one some of your more international products, you've been hearing this from some other companies. Have you seen like increased international competition from like maybe competitors who are selling in US dollars, but have like fully local currency cost basis, so they don't really need to raise prices. I guess their margins are benefiting and you guys are in a comparably tougher situation. Are you seeing any of that?\nSandy Rowland: Joe, we're really not seeing anything meaningful on that front. We're seeing across our end markets with our competitors that they are also taking price increases. I mean nobody has been immune to inflation in this market. And so we have been the price leader where we have competitive advantage. And so--\nPatrick Decker: We have a structural probably a somewhat different structure than some of our peers or other companies that you follow. And that our competitive base products that we for example sell out of Europe. Those product lines are also predominantly European competitors. So, we've got great footprint, whether it be in Italy, whether it be in Sweden, whether it be the UK. So -- and we've reduced our lead times on still being able to ship those things into the US. In North America, the markets we serve, our competitor there are for the most part, US-based companies also. So, there's just structurally not that big of a disadvantage vis-\u00e0-vis our competitors. We're kind of all in the same boat. We don't take that for granted. We're always looking for ways to further localize and take cost out and reduce lead times. \nJoe Giordano: Thanks.\nOperator: We will take our next question from John Walsh with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.\nJohn Walsh: Hi, good morning and wanted to say nice quarter.\nPatrick Decker: Thank you\nSandy Rowland: Thank you.\nPatrick Decker: Appreciate it.\nJohn Walsh: A lot of ground covered, question around price cost. One, just wondering, if you could talk about what you're seeing sequentially with some of the big cost buckets be it materials, logistics et cetera. And then, I know you've done some structural pricing initiatives, just how much of the price you think is structural? And how much might be tied to surcharges? Thank you.\nSandy Rowland: Yes. Thanks for the question, John. Yes, I'll take the last one first. And -- when you look at what we've done from a pricing perspective, we haven't taken the approach to tack on surcharges. What we've done is more permanent price increases. So, that's been our road map there. Let me give a little bit of color from a price perspective, we saw a big step-up in our price realization from Q1 to Q2. We'd expect that to moderate in the back half of the year, because it was the second half of the year, last year that we started turning on our price increases. So, that will level out a bit in the second half. And I think the other thing, I would just close with to remind people, there's been some headlines on some moderation in commodity pricing. We're still seeing inflation in many of the other categories, freight, labor, overhead, et cetera. And so, we're still facing an inflationary environment. But net-net, all in, we're going to be in a better place in the second half of the year, than we were in the first half.\nJohn Walsh: Great. And then maybe just as a follow-on, any color you can provide kind of last time we saw commodity deflation and experience that. I mean, obviously, as you just noted it's more than commodities, but just curious historically, the ability of the price.\nPatrick Decker: Yes. The -- if you take one example of when we were in the heavy tariff situation and then a number of those tariffs were rolled back, we did not give up those increases because of the value that we were selling to our customers, and they understood the situation we were in. And so, historically, when there has been a rollback in material inflation, we've been pretty successful at hanging on to that. So, I think almost entirely successful in doing that. But I'm sure, there's an exception or two here or there. But in the headline numbers, they don't roll back.\nJohn Walsh: Great. Thanks for fitting me in and taking the questions. Appreciate it. Welcome.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James. Your line is open.\nPavel Molchanov: Thanks for taking my questions. Obviously supply chain problems affect everybody and probably touched on this a quarter ago. Are you seeing any situations where some of the smaller middle market players that could be prospective acquisition targets for you, are struggling disproportionately and perhaps creating kind of an opportunistic situation for you to look at M&A?\nPatrick Decker: No. It's an interesting question. And I think it was perhaps raised earlier in the previous quarter when we were all even more, needy into supply chain challenges. We never really looked at it that way. We haven't really seen, I mean the companies that we look at are high-quality and may not always be at big scale, but they are pretty good at managing their supply chains as well. I mean, they're much more focused on product line or a couple of offerings. Having said that I do believe -- and this speaks to maybe the question that Joe asked earlier, I think all of us look at supply chain now as being one of the new most important competitive advantages that a company needed to have, because whether it be chip supply this time it will be something else down the road. And the world is so interdependent at this point in time. And we've got a whole lot better ourselves. We still have ways to go. But I do think that it can be the form of a new synergy going forward, but it's not prominent in our thinking about the specific pipeline that we've got right now.\nPavel Molchanov: Understood. A follow-up about the U.K. specifically. There was a report from one of the government experts the other day saying that without the implementation of smart water metering, the U.K. would be experiencing outright water scarcity by the end of this decade, pretty striking headline. Just thought, I'd get your perspective on that.\nPatrick Decker: Yeah. So I won't prognosticate on the prediction. But what I can reinforce is, the lead of late which is the office of water in the U.K. they regulate the 17 or so utilities that serve the U.K. And that five-year AMP cycle they go through there is a preempt piece to that where they all have to come for with their proposals in order to get their funding approvals, their rate cases approved. And all that is published very visibly as to what are the top three priorities that each utility is focusing on, they're mandated to have that. And we can confirm that, in this last cycle unlike any cycle before, virtually every one of utilities when you look at what they were trying to solve for it was things around scarcity. It was things around water losses and how they do all that in an affordable efficient way. So that common theme was a big deal. And then also in some cases, climate change impact in terms of flood prevention and building more resilient infrastructure. So there is a lot there. It makes it a very attractive market. So hopefully that was helpful.\nPavel Molchanov: Thank you very much.\nPatrick Decker: Thank you.\nOperator: We have reached our allotted time for questions. I would now like to turn the call back over to Patrick Decker, for any additional or closing remarks.\nPatrick Decker: Well, thanks everyone for your time today for your continued support. I know we've run a bit long here. I appreciate the questions and the interest. I trust you'll all have a very safe and enjoyable remainder of the year summer. I know you're a need even earnings season. So we appreciate your time and your attention. And I look forward to hearing to you again.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude today's Xylem's Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Please disconnect your lines at this time. And have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Sandy Rowland",
            "content": "Thanks, Patrick. Please turn to slide 4. The team did a tremendous job over delivering on our commitments with disciplined execution on strong fundamentals and continuing demand. As a result, revenues grew globally high single digits in Western Europe and mid-single digits in the US. In emerging markets, revenue grew low double digits, excluding China, which was slowed by ongoing COVID restrictions. In a moment, I'll detail performance by segment. But in short, utilities was up 2%, led by strength in Western Europe and the US. Industrial grew 12% on increasing activity in all geographies, particularly the US, Western Europe and Latin America. Commercial was down 1%, strength in Western Europe was offset by continued US supply chain challenges. And residential was up 13%, led by commercial execution and backlog conversion in the US. Organic orders were up 6% in the quarter, with water infrastructure up 21% and AWS up 2%, partially offset by M&CS. Global demand continues to be strong, and our book-to-bill ratio was a healthy 1.2 in the quarter. EBITDA margin was 16.6%, well-above our guided range, and that reflects a 240 basis point rise sequentially on strong commercial execution and discipline on discretionary costs. Price contributed two points of incremental revenue growth sequentially. As Patrick mentioned, pricing and productivity benefits combined more than offset inflation, and our EPS in the quarter was $0.66, coming in above expectations. Please turn to slide 5, and I'll review the quarter's segment performance in a bit more detail. Water Infrastructure revenue exceeded expectations, growing 9% organically in the quarter. Industrial remained strong, driven by continued backlog conversion, and our US wastewater utility business grew double digits as supply chain constraints improved throughout the quarter. Geographically, the US and Western Europe were also up double digits, driven by robust transport demand in the US and treatment applications in Western Europe, alongside strong dewatering growth. Emerging markets, excluding China, was up high single-digits, driven by strength across Latin America and Africa. These markets were down mid-single digits, including China, due to COVID site access restrictions there. Orders in the second quarter were up 21% organically versus last year, with growth underpinned by strong underlying demand supported by large infrastructure projects in the US and Canada. We also saw sustained demand in our wastewater utility business in North America and Western Europe. EBITDA margin for the segment was up 240 basis points as strong price realization, volume and productivity benefits more than offset inflation and investments. Please turn to Page 6. In the applied water segment, second quarter organic revenues grew 7%, modestly exceeding our expectations. Geographically, the US was up high single-digits with strength across industrial and residential, partially offset by supply chain constraints in the commercial business. Western Europe delivered low double-digit growth with healthy gains across all end markets, led by benefits from new energy-efficient product introductions. Emerging markets was up low single-digits, driven by strong industrial demand. Orders were up 2% organically and continued to outpace revenue with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.1 for the quarter. Segment's EBITDA margin declined 130 basis points compared to the prior year. And while price realization more than offset inflation, volume and mix for the quarter were negative. Despite lower volumes, demand remains robust as seen in our book-to-bill ratio. However, we expect to continue to deliver sequential EBITDA improvement as the benefit of pricing actions comes through our backlog. And now let's turn to Slide 7, and I'll cover our Measurement & Control Solutions business. M&CS exceeded expectations on strong demand and modestly better chip supply with revenue declining 2% organically. We also saw strong growth in our test and pipeline assessment services product lines. Geographically, the US and Western Europe were down mid-single digits and emerging markets was up high single-digits. M&CS orders declined 9% organically in the quarter, due to lapping some large deals in North America and the UK. Underlying demand for our AMI offering remains strong and orders continue to outpace revenue. We recorded a book-to-bill ratio of 1.4 and has built a backlog of over $2 billion. Segment EBITDA margin in the quarter was ahead of expectations, expanding 120 basis points sequentially on improved volumes. As supply chain stability improves and we convert our backlog, we will see strong margin accretion on higher volumes as we have previously discussed. And now let's turn to Slide 8 for an overview of cash flows and our balance sheet. In the second quarter, we generated free cash flow of $67 million, driven by income conversion, partially offset by higher working capital. Our financial position remains strong with $1.1 billion in cash and $1.9 billion of available liquidity. Net debt-to-EBITDA leverage is 1.5 times. Please turn to Slide 9, and I'll hand the call back to Patrick to look forward at the rest of the year. Thanks, Patrick. Consistent with our previous presentations, we've provided key facts for each end market in the appendix. The outlook across our end markets has broadly improved. We expect healthy underlying demand will continue through the remainder of the year, with improved price/cost mix and modest improvements in supply chain. We now expect our utility business to grow mid-single digits, up from low single digits. On the wastewater side, we now expect mid-single-digit growth, up from low to mid-single-digit growth on improved backlog conversion and resilient global demand. The outlook for longer-term capital project spending and bid activity remains solid globally. For clean water utilities, we now expect mid-single-digit growth up from flat. The main driver is earlier than expected easing of chip supply constraints. Although, supply has improved, lead times continue to remain elevated, and our volumes continue to be constrained. We also expect momentum in our test and pipeline assessment services business to continue, due to increasing focus in our end markets on infrastructure and climate challenges, as evidenced by our strong backlog. Please turn to slide 11. Looking at the industrial end market, we now expect high single-digit to low double-digit growth, up from mid-single-digit growth and increased activity in the US and Europe and strong global demand for our solutions. We continue to expect the commercial end market to deliver mid-single to high single-digit growth on solid replacement activity and new introductions in the US and Europe. In residential, our smallest end market, we now expect healthy demand to drive double-digit growth, up from mid-single digits. As a reminder, the majority of our commercial and residential end market exposure is replacement driven versus new construction. Now let's turn to slide 12, and I'll walk you through our updated guidance. Our outperformance in the second quarter gives us confidence to increase our full year guidance for organic revenue growth and to raise the low end of the adjusted EPS range. We now expect full year organic revenue growth of 8% to 10%, up from 4% to 6%, and we have raised the bottom end of our EPS range by $0.10. The increase in the reported revenue guidance is more modest, as the strength of the dollar offsets roughly half of our operational improvements. We have modified our assumptions on our basket of currency exposure, which is included in the appendix. These changes result in an incremental $0.05 headwind to the full year EPS guide. And this is on top of a $0.10 EPS FX headwind that we discussed last quarter. On slide 13, we've shown how our guidance breaks down by segment. We now expect high single-digit growth in Water Infrastructure, up from mid-single digits and low double-digit growth in Applied Water, up from high single digits, driven by disciplined commercial execution and backlog conversion on continued strong demand in both segments. We now expect Measurement & Control Solutions to be up mid-single digits, up from flat. This reflects the outperformance in the first half from chip supply improving sooner than expected. For 2022, we are raising the bottom end of our adjusted EBITDA margin range, which is now 16.5% to 17% and this yields the adjusted EPS range of $2.50 to $2.70 that I just mentioned. We now expect free cash flow conversion to be approximately 90% of net income. We're carrying about a month of extra inventory to mitigate the risk of supply chain disruptions and provide continuity of service to our customers.  We expect to bring conversion back to historical levels as supply chain stabilize, enabling us to return to free cash flow conversion of at least 100%. We have provided you with a number of other full year assumptions on the slide to supplement your models. And now drilling down on the third quarter, we anticipate total company organic revenues will be up 10% to 12%. This includes mid-single-digit growth in Water infrastructure and mid-double-digit growth in Applied Water and M&CS. We expect third quarter adjusted EBITDA margin to be in the range of 16.5% to 17%, a sequential improvement over the prior quarter.  And with that, please turn to Slide 14, and I'll turn the call back over to Patrick for closing comments. Good morning, Deane. Yes. Good morning, Deane. Thanks for the question. We certainly were pleased to see definitely slightly better supply throughout the quarter. And I think if you go back to where we were from a low point from a revenue perspective, last year in Q4, we're under $300 million of revenue. We clawed that back and we're approaching 350 in the second quarter. So it was definitely a bigger step-up than we had anticipated. As we look at the second half of the year Deane, we see a more modest increase from Q2 to Q3, and then a little more -- another step-up into Q4. We think we're going to exit the year really in line with what we had modeled. We've just been benefiting from some better supply earlier in the year. And I give credit to the team that has been in really close contact with all of our key suppliers leaning in and also being opportunistic in the spot market so that we could take care of our customers. Yes. Deane, the margins are clearly richer on the digital side. And we saw that in our mix in M&CS in the quarter. We were about 5% less digital this year compared to last year. And I think that was with the purpose of taking care of our customers and putting product into the hands of our customers where -- to keep them up and going. And so that took a more mechanical meaning this time around. I think as we look at longer-term where we expect to land from a margin perspective nothing has changed structurally from what we laid out in our Investor Day last year in September. Yeah. I think a great question, Deane. When we built our plan for 2022, we expected that supply chains would be meaningful -- meaningfully improved in the second half of the year. And we're not seeing big changes yet. And therefore we think it's prudent to carry some extra inventory with the leaning of delivering on revenue and delivering on our backlog. So there's, a couple of things that are going on. Lead times are still elongated. We're still having problems where we're missing one or two key components and then we're not able to get the entire solution out the door. And of course inflation is bringing up the overall balances in our inventory. But we will bring that down. We'd expect that is certainly in 2023 at the latest and it will be a key focus item for our teams. This is not something that we plan to do for a long period of time. Good morning, Nath. Yeah. I think obviously a really important question, Nath. I think one thing I want to call out is we've already seen from the low point in Q4, 300 basis points of margin expansion from Q4 to Q2. And that's evolving because of the higher volumes, partially constrained by some of the things that we referenced earlier in the call the mechanical mix the redesign costs on optimal manufacturing flows. But as we look out into the back half of the year, there's not as much of a pickup from a revenue perspective, but we would expect margins to kind of continue along the same trajectory that we've recognized from Q4 Q to Q2. And I'm not going to give guidance on 2023 on this call. But as we look out to 2024, 2025 we don't see anything structurally different about where margins should land in that time period. Yeah. I think for us Europe has been a real bright spot. And it's not just in one segment. It's really across the entire portfolio. We've seen good revenues in Europe. We've seen good orders. I know, there's a lot of concern about potential recession in Europe, and the industrial market in particular. I think one thing, I would call out is that, if you look at our dewatering business, for example, which is more industrial, we've done a lot to diversify the end markets there, much less exposure to oil and gas than we did in the prior recession. I think we're down to about 1% revenue in that end market. And then, of course, there we've also been diversifying from a geographic perspective. Yes. No. Great question. We do have a plan to start working down some of our inventory through the back half of the year. It's nothing dramatic. It's going to take place over the next six months on a very gradual basis. And I think we are \u2013 our teams have been doing a good job on the elements around working capital. We are going to continue to lean in hard on collections, and make sure we bring those in, and that \u2013 we've seen really good results through the pandemic on our collection front. And similarly, we're doing work around, getting better terms from a payable perspective. I may have referenced it on another call. We have a supply chain financing program that's quite active, and it allows our supplier base to take advantage of our credit rating. We're getting more of our supplier base engaged on that program, and that will give us some incremental days from a payables perspective. And I think, it all ties into being prudent also around cost and discretionary spend, and CapEx spend to make sure, we start seeing a better cash conversion in the second half, which lines up with our historical seasonality as well. Yeah. So we haven't changed our strategy, our capital allocation strategy. We've typically bought stock back in the first quarter, which is when we have a vesting date in our equity compensation programs. And so this was nothing that we bought back stock in Q1. We wrapped that up at \u2013 in the March time frame. And as we look at our M&A funnel, and pipeline, we still see a really \u2013 we're really encouraged by the funnel, the range of opportunities, and that remains a higher priority for us than buying back our stock. Good morning, Mike. Yeah. I think, Mike really good question. Nothing has changed structurally about our backlog. If you look at our AWS business that has a larger book-to-bill ratio than the other segments, and we're carrying record backlogs across really all three of our segments. And we did see really strong book-to-bill ratios across the portfolio in the quarter from an orders perspective. As we look at our water infrastructure and Xylem's M&CS backlogs, they stretch out for longer periods of time. Water infrastructure is in the middle. We have our transport business, which turns fairly quickly and a treatment business that has projects that stand out for multiple years. And then M&TS is the longest coupled with the supply chain constraints, which don't magically disappear at any one month, we have a $2 billion backlog there. So that's going to take a couple of years plus to work to work through. Yes. I mean, we are really pleased with what we saw from a price perspective. We've leaned in harder on price, because inflation is also coming in higher throughout the year. A big milestone we did get price cost positive in the quarter from a dollar perspective, given the magnitude it's slightly dilutive to the rate in Q2. Q3 is a little bit lower from a seasonality -- a little bit lower on the revenue side compared to Q2 just because of the typical seasonality in our water infrastructure business. And so in Q3, we expect to continue to be price/cost positive on a dollar basis, probably still in the same order of magnitude about 30 basis points this quarter in that order of magnitude dilutive from a rate perspective. And then we think in Q4, we should be positive again from a dollar perspective and neutral from a rate perspective. So, really good progress across the portfolio to reach this important milestone. Thanks, Mike. Good morning, Scott. Yes. So if you look at water infrastructure business sits, we saw a really good margin performance. That business has been the most resilient when we look over the past couple of years. And certainly, the recovery in dewatering is a contributing factor. And so a lot of hard work has gone into our dewatering business both to diversify it from an end market perspective, from a geographic perspective. We've made some purposeful investments in our fleet to make it more modern and current and we're seeing that upside on the rental side as well. So certainly dewatering positive seeing good orders momentum there continue in the quarter on a global basis. So certainly helpful to the margin expansion story with the water infrastructure. I think when orders -- we've had a real surge in orders, over the past several quarters and so while the headline print on orders for MCS may have been negative, when you look at the orders from a dollar perspective, we're still running well ahead of what we're able to convert from a revenue perspective. I think we had $475 million of orders in the quarter, which is still a really good number relative to our revenue. The pipeline continues to be robust. We're still in the early innings of the overall AMI conversion journey. About one-third of the industry has converted to AMI, in North America. So, there's still a lot of runway and we have a really differentiated product there that's gaining traction. Good morning. Yes. So I think we were price cost positive excluding productivity in the quarter. So that was really encouraging. We have a pipeline of continuous improvement product -- projects that we're driving across the portfolio. Some of that has been a little bit constrained this year, as we've moved engineers off of continuous improvement projects, on to redesign work. As Patrick talked about earlier in the call is that work matures and we move through the sort of the test and certification part of that process, we'll be able to bring some of our resources back and focus on continuous improvement projects and continue to pick up momentum on the productivity front as well. But I think looking across the globe our teams are doing a good job there and it's contributing to our margin improvement story on a quarter sequential basis. Hey Joe. Joe, we're really not seeing anything meaningful on that front. We're seeing across our end markets with our competitors that they are also taking price increases. I mean nobody has been immune to inflation in this market. And so we have been the price leader where we have competitive advantage. And so-- Thank you. Yes. Thanks for the question, John. Yes, I'll take the last one first. And -- when you look at what we've done from a pricing perspective, we haven't taken the approach to tack on surcharges. What we've done is more permanent price increases. So, that's been our road map there. Let me give a little bit of color from a price perspective, we saw a big step-up in our price realization from Q1 to Q2. We'd expect that to moderate in the back half of the year, because it was the second half of the year, last year that we started turning on our price increases. So, that will level out a bit in the second half. And I think the other thing, I would just close with to remind people, there's been some headlines on some moderation in commodity pricing. We're still seeing inflation in many of the other categories, freight, labor, overhead, et cetera. And so, we're still facing an inflationary environment. But net-net, all in, we're going to be in a better place in the second half of the year, than we were in the first half."

            "content": "I can't speak for all of our peers. I think, we have been working very -- as we said earlier, working very closely with our suppliers. The trajectory on where we exit the year is very consistent with what we expected. It's been good work to get some better chip supply earlier. And also within M&CS, there have been some other product lines that have been strong as well. It's not only the chips that drove the upside in M&CS. So we're seeing good results from our test business, some traction with our pipeline assessment services business. And so that broader portfolio is also helping us get out ahead of what we had modeled for the year."

            "name": "Patrick Decker",
            "content": "Thanks Andrea and good morning, everyone. We're pleased to report that the team delivered a very strong second quarter performance on all key metrics and well ahead of our guidance. But the result builds on the momentum and underlying demand we saw in the first quarter with disciplined operational execution on strong fundamentals and a moderate easing in chip supply constraints. Revenues grew 6% organically, surpassing our guide. The team's commercial performance was outstanding in all segments and supply improvements in M&CS and Water Infrastructure enabled increased conversion of orders into revenue. Geographically, the growth was broad-based, Western Europe was up 9%, and North America at 6%, and emerging markets, excluding China, was up double-digits. While China was down due to COVID lockdowns, backlogs continue to grow on underlying demand. In addition to organic revenue growth, the team posted 6% orders growth. That orders momentum reflects strong performance across each segment. Water Infrastructure set the strongest base, growing orders 21% in the quarter. Our backlogs were up sharply versus last year, with digital solutions comprising more than half the total backlog. EBITDA margin also came in well-ahead of our guidance. We delivered strong quarter-on-quarter expansion driven by disciplined execution. All of that good work delivered earnings per share of $0.66, which soundly beat our expectations. As you can see, some incremental improvement in chip supply came earlier than anticipated, and it had a strong positive impact on the quarter. To be clear, we don't believe chip supply will improve much more quickly than previously expected. What we are seeing is a gradual improvement in supply, which provides further confidence in our second half outlook. The team also delivered pricing actions to mitigate inflation across all segments, and I want to give a big shout out to the entire team, including our distribution and channel partners for managing through a dynamic market environment. We combine those disciplined actions with productivity savings from simplifying the way we work and entirely offset inflation in the quarter. We expect demand to remain resilient due to the essential nature of the services our customers need from us. So as you've seen in this morning's release, we are raising our organic revenue guidance to 8% to 10% growth for the full year, and we're raising the bottom end of our EPS range by $0.10. We'll come back and discuss our full review of the macro environment in a few minutes, but let me hand it over now to Sandy for some additional color on the second quarter. Thanks, Sandy. As you've seen, the team is delivering strong results in a very dynamic environment. Given the prominence of discussions about macro uncertainty in the economy, it's worth spending a few minutes talking about our confidence in the resilience of underlying demand for Xylem's offerings. The aspect of our sector and our business model that gets most discussed in this context and for good reason is that, our offering is at the core of essential services through the ups and downs of economic cycles. Cities and towns must provide essential water and wastewater services. So, the demand associated with water management tends to be quite resilient. It's also important to understand the dynamics between OpEx versus CapEx across economic cycles, particularly for water utilities. OpEx spending is very stable, given the basic need for day-to-day water services, CapEx which represents roughly a-third of spending on Xylem's offerings is focused on infrastructure expansion, or refurbishment, and it comes with longer regulatory and funding approvals. So spending against these projects once approved, historically, has not wavered to a material extent. And this is not just a US dynamic, but it applies globally. You see it in Europe, both at the regional level. For example, with the EU's recovery and resilience funding, and at the country level as seen in the UK's AMP process. Similarly, infrastructure funding is embedded in China's five-year planning cycle. And of course, you're all familiar with the recent US federal infrastructure funding and the time lines on which the state revolving funds work. Those structural advantages of the sector, however, are only a benefit, if our portfolio delivers distinctive value to our customers through the cycle. For many of our customers, value is defined in terms of becoming more efficient. And that means modernizing their infrastructure, with digital technologies, to make their networks more affordable. Our AMI metrology backlogs offer a proof point about the resilience of that demand. Despite the ongoing chip supply challenges that have dogged the tech sector for the last year, our backlogs have continued to grow. Our distinctive data and communications driven AMI solutions, deliver a step change in both efficiency and resilience for utilities. AMI represents now roughly a-third of all water meters in the US, which shows the progress of adoption, but also the potential for future growth. Given the budgetary pressures the utility face, both to generate revenue and reduce water loss, smart meters will remain a top imperative. One other demand trend that will persist through the cycle and in fact, is set to increase is the growing response to climate change. Cities around the world are committing to net zero emissions. At the same time, they are investing in mitigating the impacts of climate change that are already here, like those, we've seen this summer in the form of historic and tragic flooding in the US and Asia. These are generational challenges. Innovations and new approaches are absolutely essential to solving them, because water management is a significant carbon contributor, accounting for up to 10% of greenhouse gas emissions globally. In commercial and residential markets, cities have begun introducing building regulations to reduce emissions, including efficient water management standards for both regional construction and retrofits, and the utility market, which produces greenhouse gas emissions, equal to the entire global shipping industry. It's going to be required to reduce its carbon intensity in line with the commitments of their cities, municipalities and countries. And we at Xylem are an outright leader in this space and are in a unique position to support our customers in their sustainability commitments. You may have seen that we released our annual sustainability report in May. Among all the progress made against our 2025 goals, I'd highlight that we enabled our customers to reduce their carbon footprint by 730,000 metric tons in 2021 alone using our technology. That is the equivalent of taking 160,000 cars off the road. And we're on track to help them reduce their emissions by 2.8 million metric tons by 2025. So stepping back, we're very confident that the macro force is driving our underlying demand will continue. We're also confident that Xylem is better positioned than ever to create value by helping our customers respond to them. So now, I'll turn it back over to Sandy for more detail and color on our outlook and guide. Thanks, Sandy. We saw the power, some short-term swings this past quarter. A small improvement in chip supply had a big impact. Currency movements have been offering what you could call a challenging forecasting environment and the unexpected duration of COVID shutdowns held China back.  Just a quick note on China, our team and our customers there have been continuing to serve their communities under very tough conditions, given the extensive restrictions in place to manage COVID, I'm incredibly proud of the team. We expect to see progressive improvement in the market for the second half and have full confidence China will continue to be a source of innovation and growth for the long run. In the context of short-term uncertainty, our job is demanded through the unexpected. Meeting those challenges is what being a good operator is all about and the team has certainly been doing that. The team's strong operational execution is built on the same foundation as our 2025 growth and strategic milestones, a consistent story at the heart of our investment thesis. We're building on our leadership position as a technology company with a durable business model. We're benefiting from long-term secular trends of rising demand, driven by water and climate-related challenges. We're driving above-market growth and margin expansion as we digitize our portfolio to serve our customers' imperative to be more efficient. We're successfully putting sustainability at the center of everything we do, across our company, our customers and our communities. And we'll create additional stakeholder value with disciplined capital allocation as opportunity is won. Strong continued demand and the kind of performance we're seeing from the Xylem team show our ability to deliver on that thesis. And with that, operator, let's open it up for Q&A. Good morning, Deane. And I would just add Deane that \u2013 sorry, for my voice that in addition to that the team has done terrific work not just on landing chips in the spot market, but a lot of the redesign work that we talked about in past quarters is nearing completion. And so there was an added cost in the quarter for that, but it was there to really make sure we secured supply for our customers. And we also shipped out more mechanical meters in the interim in order to bridge that gap while we're waiting on the chip to come through. So there were multiple dynamics, but as Sandy laid out things certainly got better and we feel more confident now about the second half than we did before. If anything gained the backlog has gotten stronger, especially with some of the large deals that we brought in over the last few quarters and the bidding pipeline remains very robust just given how early we still are in terms of conversion to MI across, especially the US on the water side of things. So we expect that runway to be there for quite some time. And from a segment perspective Deane, it was most notable in Applied Water, where again we've had continued knock-on effects whether be supply chain casings coming out of China due to COVID. Obviously, we expect those to continue somewhat in the second half. And that's why to Sandy's point we brought in an extra month of inventory into that business. So it's very visible. We know exactly what it is. It's totally under control. It's simply a matter of meaning to do that in order to supply customers and maintain that demand. Thank you. Good morning, Nathan. Again, I would just offer up, Nathan, you publicly recall this, but if you go back over time, and look at previous kind of industrial recessions back in kind of the 2015, 2016 timeframe, our European business still held up in terms of growth during that timeframe, because the results are much less cyclical there given the end market exposure that we've got. And also \u2013 so for example, I think the numbers in 2016, Europe still grew 3% despite being in the middle of an industrial recession.\\ So, we feel pretty good about that. We think it would be that resilient again. I think as you well know, if we were to first see any softening in orders which we've not seen to this point, it would be \u2013 it would be in our short-cycle businesses, which would be more applied water and dewater. And again, we've not seen that yet. Our backlog continues to grow good book-to-bill, and again, obviously there would be actions that we would take, if we began to see those metrics coming through, as we've done in the past. We can phase investments. We still have further productivity opportunities to go after across the organization, and we're sitting on record backlogs. And the fact that, we've been able to weather the chip supply issue, without losing any business, and those deals and backlog is pretty strong statement about the resilience of our pipeline and the markets that we serve. Thank you Yeah, I would just add to that, if you look at our balance sheet, we've got upwards of about $4 billion in dry powder, and we are not hesitant to do a deal when it needs to be done. But again, that would all be in advanced in serving our strategy that we've laid out. As Sandy said, the pipeline is very active all different sizes of opportunities in that pipeline. But again, we want to continue to be disciplined and selective with an eye towards significant value creation. And again, as I always say it takes two to tango. Good morning, Mike. If I could just go back to your question on visibility and backlog. I think the other dimension that we feel much better about now than we even did in the last industrial downturn is the visibility and the closest we have to our channel partners, our distribution channel partners both here in the US as well as in Europe, where we have meaningful indirect channel business. And we've got much better visibility and coordination with them now than we did back then. So we got hit with a couple of surprises last time around in a quarter or two, we feel much better about that not happening going forward. So they are also our eyes and ears of what's going on in the marketplace at a local level. Hey, good morning, Scott. Yes. Scott another great question. It's a mixed bag. I'd say, supply chain in the aggregate has modestly improved versus Q1, but it really does vary across the three segments. So as we mentioned, chip supply getting a bit better within MCS, but lead times are still long but they're not worse, they're getting better. And water infrastructure, we have seen improvement in lead times from our European factory into the US. And certainly, what our infrastructure has benefited over the last year by offering more competitive lead times due to better vertical integration that we did within the company. But then I would say as we mentioned earlier one of the reasons we're carrying an extra month of inventory is because of applied water. It's not limited to ply water but that's the main driver. And that's really again just knock on effects from China mainly castings, but also we see continued delays in shipping and logistics that we're just having to work through. So I'd say, it's getting marginally better across the board, but it really varies by segment. . Sure, yes. So -- and obviously, it's a big market. So it does vary depending upon the vertical -- the end markets that we're talking about. What we find is that the utility side is much more stable. So right now the issue for us has not been so much for our plants not to be up and running. We returned back to, kind of, normal levels in terms of staffing and presence back in May I believe it was. It really though is logistics and transportation have been at a standstill because customers and colleagues are required to be at home. These impact all kinds of projects Scott, but mainly the government-funded projects. But that's not a bad thing because those projects don't go away. They simply shift to the right. And we would see from the past that there would be an accelerated catch-up as the restrictions are lifted. So we've got plenty of capacity in our factories and as to the distribution partners to get this stuff out. It's simply a matter of sites not being open. I mean, customer job sites, utilities not being open. That's what we're waiting to see recovery. We're not assuming that we're going to get much of any recovery in the second half of this year, but we do expect that to recover to come back quite strongly in 2023. But no structural changes in our view on the attractiveness of China. This is simply things moving to the right. Thank you. The only other thing I would add, which I \u2013 I'm cautious to share too much on this because we've got good visibility but it's not perfect because things could change. But I do think, depending upon who you're including in that peer group, it talks about digital, we've got somewhat higher concentration. Therefore we get a bit more leverage with suppliers. And we've got some really strong relationships with our partners, whether it be the direct suppliers from the chips and wafers or whether it be our partnership with Flex, we aggregate our demand and I think it gives us a stronger platform, at least stronger than what would be if we were doing it all on our own. So some of these things it's also just \u2013 I mean the number of calls that I and others have been on with the leaders of these companies and you just got \u2013 the team has been working it. And we've had to be more patient than we wanted to. But I think those relationships and those investments and relationships are beginning to pay-off. Thank you. Yes. And I would just add it's \u2013 I mean certainly, it's one of the shorter cycle businesses that we've got and it's not immune to cyclical downturn just like it hits it up on the way up. I think the other area that we benefited from is full on integration within our commercial team, most notably in North America, where I think it's been upgraded and leadership. I think there have been investments that Sandy as talked about. And the diversification has really been away from heavy oil and gas and mining and looking at more utility muni opportunities, where there's visibility with some of our other businesses in the portfolio. So good lead generation by sharing leads with our field services teams. So we're in the early stages of that, but we've had some really good growth rates there. We're up maybe yes double-digit here through the first half of the year on the order side and we hope that continues. Yes. And I think as we said earlier, I know none of us ever like to be talking about difficult year-over-year comps, when you have big deals in a quarter last year, but it is there is some element of the nature of that in the business. And we'll certainly be even more transparent, going forward as to, how big are those deals, what other big deals are coming because it is a big rich pipeline right now that we're bidding on. And so, we have been running hot for the better part of 1.5 years or so, on some big deals big books. So but we were very positive on that pipeline. \nQ \u2013 Saree Boroditsky: Thanks for taking my question. Thank you. Good morning. Yes. No we've really -- we've not seen -- I mean well first of all, we see demand in utilities very robust. And especially here, I mean stable in Europe, good emerging markets obviously ex-China and was really strong in the quarter here in North America. We really have not seen anything meaningful, come through from a funding standpoint, yet. So that would still be upside. And -- we talk a lot about the infrastructure bill here in the US. But as I mentioned in my prepared comments, you've also got the recovery and resilience funding going on in the EU. You've got at the country level in the UK's five-year process, that we talk about. And then you've got the infrastructure funding that's embedded in Sean's five-year planning cycle, which remains unchanged. So all those together, we think really point to a very strong funding infrastructure for utility spend globally. Hey good morning. It's a great question. I think right now Joe as -- certainly as I look at it and Sandy can certainly comment here. I think we're going to look back on and say we did quite well is navigating through the chip supply and holding a team together, holding morale, people spending days and nights and weekends over and over and over again on the phone with suppliers. Customers working -- our commercial teams are working with customers keeping them on board. Nobody happy. But the team's fortitude really shown through and it continued to show through. I think two, the fact that there have been no cancellations in a record backlog is a testimony to that. And no decline in the margins of that backlog due to chip supply. Our margins have been impacted by some of the near-term choices we've had to make on spending money on redesigns, on selling some mechanical meters in at lower margin than our other meters. And so those I think are all going to be in the plus column. I think if there were things that we could have done differently the one that comes to mind for me was I think we probably waited a little too long to get going on some of the redesign work. I don't think we missed it by much. But I think we all learned that the sooner you get on that, the better you're going to get because it takes a while to sort through that. So, that would be my high-level takes on this, but we're not out of it yet. So, we still have time to reserve the right to get smarter. We have a structural probably a somewhat different structure than some of our peers or other companies that you follow. And that our competitive base products that we for example sell out of Europe. Those product lines are also predominantly European competitors. So, we've got great footprint, whether it be in Italy, whether it be in Sweden, whether it be the UK. So -- and we've reduced our lead times on still being able to ship those things into the US. In North America, the markets we serve, our competitor there are for the most part, US-based companies also. So, there's just structurally not that big of a disadvantage vis-a\u0300-vis our competitors. We're kind of all in the same boat. We don't take that for granted. We're always looking for ways to further localize and take cost out and reduce lead times. Thank you Appreciate it. Yes. The -- if you take one example of when we were in the heavy tariff situation and then a number of those tariffs were rolled back, we did not give up those increases because of the value that we were selling to our customers, and they understood the situation we were in. And so, historically, when there has been a rollback in material inflation, we've been pretty successful at hanging on to that. So, I think almost entirely successful in doing that. But I'm sure, there's an exception or two here or there. But in the headline numbers, they don't roll back. No. It's an interesting question. And I think it was perhaps raised earlier in the previous quarter when we were all even more, needy into supply chain challenges. We never really looked at it that way. We haven't really seen, I mean the companies that we look at are high-quality and may not always be at big scale, but they are pretty good at managing their supply chains as well. I mean, they're much more focused on product line or a couple of offerings. Having said that I do believe -- and this speaks to maybe the question that Joe asked earlier, I think all of us look at supply chain now as being one of the new most important competitive advantages that a company needed to have, because whether it be chip supply this time it will be something else down the road. And the world is so interdependent at this point in time. And we've got a whole lot better ourselves. We still have ways to go. But I do think that it can be the form of a new synergy going forward, but it's not prominent in our thinking about the specific pipeline that we've got right now. Yeah. So I won't prognosticate on the prediction. But what I can reinforce is, the lead of late which is the office of water in the U.K. they regulate the 17 or so utilities that serve the U.K. And that five-year AMP cycle they go through there is a preempt piece to that where they all have to come for with their proposals in order to get their funding approvals, their rate cases approved. And all that is published very visibly as to what are the top three priorities that each utility is focusing on, they're mandated to have that. And we can confirm that, in this last cycle unlike any cycle before, virtually every one of utilities when you look at what they were trying to solve for it was things around scarcity. It was things around water losses and how they do all that in an affordable efficient way. So that common theme was a big deal. And then also in some cases, climate change impact in terms of flood prevention and building more resilient infrastructure. So there is a lot there. It makes it a very attractive market. So hopefully that was helpful. Thank you. Well, thanks everyone for your time today for your continued support. I know we've run a bit long here. I appreciate the questions and the interest. I trust you'll all have a very safe and enjoyable remainder of the year summer. I know you're a need even earnings season. So we appreciate your time and your attention. And I look forward to hearing to you again."

The team came into 2022 with strong momentum, and they've taken full advantage of robust underlying demand around the world to deliver our first quarter operational results above expectations.  Revenues grew 4% organically, surpassing our guidance. Despite ongoing chip shortages constraining our utilities business, supply is slowly improving, which is reflected in quarter sequential revenue growth and EBITDA margin expansion in our metrology business.  Revenue strength was also broad-based globally. We saw healthy growth in every region, excluding China, given the COVID impact there. Western Europe was a standout, delivering 10% growth in the quarter.  But the robust global demand for our offering comes through most clearly in the pace of order intake. Orders were up 14% for the quarter, with record order bookings in every segment. M&CS at the fastest pace with a 25% order surge, as the value proposition of digital technologies continues to fuel demand.  Orders performance across the portfolio pushed our already healthy backlogs to 50% growth year-on-year. EBITDA margin performance was also above our previous guidance due to strong price realization, which mitigated much of the inflationary pressure, while at the same time, we continue to drive productivity and further simplification throughout the business. As a result of that good work from the team, we delivered EPS of $0.47, again, above our expectations.  The quarter did present some fresh challenges. China's ongoing response to COVID is having significant impact on our business, and it will have flow-on effects for some time in the global supply chain. And while our European business delivered exceptional revenue growth, the euro rate began to move unfavorably.  So conditions are dynamic. But the quarter's operational results show that the team is doing an excellent job, navigating the challenges and managing what it can control on a global basis.  Looking ahead, we're in a very strong position. as structural demand continues to be robust in all end markets and regions. And we have market leadership in the categories where demand is greatest, especially in digitally-enabled solutions. So we are raising our guidance for the year, and are on track to deliver the longer-term growth and strategic milestones we laid out at our Investor Day last fall.  Before turning over to Sandy for performance detail by segment, I want to mention how proud I am with the Xylem team and of our partners for their response to the war in Ukraine. When the war broke out, the Xylem team stepped up right away to provide for the safety and well-being of all of our Ukrainian colleagues and their families. Similarly, our team has shown extraordinary support by raising money for the humanitarian relief work of our NGO partners, whose activities include providing essential water and sanitation services both in Ukraine and the refugees. It's become one of our most successful mass giving campaigns ever, and I could not be prouder of the team.  Now I'll hand over to Sandy to review the quarter's results by segment.\nSandra Rowland: Thanks, Patrick. Please turn to Slide 4, and I'll give some additional color on our first quarter results. Given the quarter's challenges, the team did a great job delivering on our commitments with particularly strong performance on price and backlog execution. Revenue growth was healthy in all regions, led by a double-digit result in Western Europe and mid-single-digit gains in the U.S. In emerging markets, revenues grew high single digits excluding China, which was affected by COVID shutdowns.  In a moment, I'll offer detailed performance by segment. But in short, utilities was down 3%. Strength in Western Europe was offset by ongoing chip supply constraints and their outsized impact on our smart metering business in the U.S. Industrial grew 10% on increasing activity in all geographies, excluding China, with particular strength in Western Europe. Commercial was up 11%, led by healthy growth in the U.S., and residential was up 15%, also driven by the U.S. Organic orders were up 14% in the quarter. As Patrick mentioned, the quarter set historically high order intake with robust demand for our technologies across all segments.  EBITDA margin was 14.2%, which was above our guided range, primarily driven by stronger-than-expected price realization. Year-over-year EBITDA margin contracted 290 basis points. We got healthy price realization and productivity benefits, but they were more than offset by inflation, and lower volumes from chip shortages impacting our higher-margin smart metering solutions. As previously mentioned, we'll continue to offset inflation with progressive price realization. Our EPS in the quarter was $0.47.  Please turn to Slide 5, and I'll review the quarter's segment performance in a bit more detail. Water Infrastructure orders in the quarter were up 12% organically versus last year, with growth underpinned by sustained demand in our wastewater utility business in the U.S. and Western Europe and increasing demand for dewatering, particularly in emerging markets.  Water Infrastructure revenue was up 8% in the quarter. Industrial remained strong, and we saw revenue acceleration in our U.S. wastewater utility business as prior quarter order to revenue conversion delays eased.  Geographically, results were mixed for the segment. The U.S. and Western Europe were up mid-double digits driven by treatment deliveries in the U.S. and healthy utility OpEx in both regions. Emerging markets was down low double digits due to a challenging prior year compare in China and impacts from the recent COVID lockdown. EBITDA margin for the segment was down 140 basis points a strong price realization and productivity benefits were more than offset by inflation and investments.  Please turn to Page 6. In the Applied Water segment, first quarter orders were up 8% organically, led by price and underlying global demand. Revenues increased 10% on strong backlog execution across all end markets, along with solid price realization.  Geographically, the U.S. was up mid-double digits. All end markets showed strength, and we benefited from the traction of new product launches. Western Europe delivered high single-digit growth with healthy gains across all end markets, and increased activity in large industrial accounts.  Emerging Markets was up mid-single digits on backlog execution and activity. Segment EBITDA margin declined 380 basis points in the quarter. Similar to water infrastructure, we delivered solid price realization and productivity benefits, but they were more than offset by inflation.  And now let's turn to Slide 7, and I'll cover our Measurement & Control Solutions business. M&CS orders grew 25% organically in the quarter, reflecting continued strong demand for our metrology solutions as well as healthy demand and pipeline assessment services.  While a portion of our M&CS backlog includes orders that have been delayed due to chip shortages, our M&CS backlog is up 60% versus the prior year. It is now more than $2 billion. As we anticipated, revenue declined 9% due to constrained chip supply. We are encouraged by the gradual improvement in availability, and we realized significant quarter sequential gains. It's worth noting that the growing metrology backlog is both margin accretive and resilient. There have been no cancellations of AMI awards.  Geographically, Western Europe and emerging markets were flat with some growth from our pipeline assessment services business. Chip shortages pressed U.S. revenues down 14%. Segment EBITDA margin in the quarter was down 470 basis points compared to the prior year, but higher than last quarter. As we've noted in previous calls, the business gets very strong operating leverage from higher volumes and revenues, and those are still being held back by the supply-constrained conversion of orders. We were able to partially offset those effects with price and productivity gains.  And now let's turn to Slide 8 for an overview of cash flows and our balance sheet. Consistent with typical seasonality patterns, we used cash in the first quarter. This year, we also strategically increased safety stocks to mitigate supply chain volatility and are carrying higher inventory balances.  Our financial position remains robust with $1.1 billion in cash and available liquidity of approximately $1.9 billion. Net debt-to-EBITDA leverage is 1.5x.  And please turn to Slide 9, and I'll hand the call back over to Patrick to look forward at the rest of the year.\nPatrick Decker: Thanks, Sandy. We'll turn to detailed guidance in a moment, but as I mentioned, we are increasing our revenue outlook due to continued strong demand and higher price realization. We're also raising the bottom end of our EPS guidance by $0.05, despite increasing foreign exchange headwinds.  The team is demonstrating that we are able to use our market leadership to drive price while holding and in many cases, even gaining share as reflected in the level of our order growth trends and expanding backlogs.  In fact, I want to give a big shout out to the team, including our channel and distribution partners for doing such a great job making sure our pricing moderated the effects of inflation. We also continue to foresee chip supply playing out much as we anticipated. We've had improved supply this quarter, and we expect that trend to continue in each successive quarter through the year.  Supply of chips remains well below our current needs and is expected to remain that way through at least early 2023. Yet, our team, along with our most critical suppliers and our customers continue to navigate the challenge and maintain current backlog while still winning new business.  With our ability to capture price on surging demand and with progressive order to revenue conversion, we're confident in lifting our full year guidance. Inflation will continue to be a significant factor, of course, so we will keep driving further price realization as appropriate.  In just a moment, you'll see we've significantly modified our euro exchange assumptions, and that will have a moderating impact on our reported EPS, but we expect the team will be able to cover the majority of those headwinds operationally. Sandy will give more color on that at a segment level in a few minutes. But the overall picture is more positive than we previously anticipated for the year, and puts us squarely on track to deliver our longer-term growth and strategic milestones.  When we laid out those milestones, we also detail the strategic pillars that would enable us to deliver them. They included making it easier for customers to do business with us, making it easier for our colleagues to serve them and continuing to reduce business complexity. So today, alongside our quarterly results, we've announced that we are further unifying and simplifying our segment and regional leadership.  Since the acquisitions that created our M&CS segment, we maintained a separate commercial interface to utility customers. This was necessary for some time to create a strong and focused new offering from Xylem, which has proven successful in achieving record deal wins and backlog.  Now we believe we have the opportunity to move to the next phase of our journey and building a single platform, one that leverages the market-leading breadth of our portfolio and makes it easier for customers to access it. We've previously done that across the rest of the world, except North America. So today, we announced that we are moving to 1 interface for our customers across the Americas as well.  We are integrating and unifying the leadership of the Americas commercial team. They will report to Matthew Pine, who will also now assume leadership of both the AWS and M&CS segments.  In Europe, Hayati Arcadis continues to lead commercial operations as well as the Water Infrastructure segment and will now lead the build-out of Xylem services offering globally. And Fran Sabinco will continue to lead commercial operations across the emerging markets.  As a result of the changes we've announced today, Colin Sable will leave Xylem after a transition period during which he will focus on a smooth leadership handover and provide advisory support to me and the leadership team. Most of you know, Colin. And so you know he has been a stalwart contributor to Xylem's growth story since the beginning. In his 16 years with the company, both with Xylem and our predecessor, ITT, his insight has been at the center of our strategic vision. His leadership has contributed to our emergence as a market leader in digital technologies as our M&CS orders growth shows, and I am profoundly grateful to have benefited from his considerable talent and unwavering commitment. We will miss him at the leadership table and our colleagues will miss him as a leader.  Turning to sustainability. Our growth framework emphasizes the creation of both economic and social value. Our performance on social value creation is highlighted in our annual sustainability report, which we'll publish later this month.  I won't steal too much of his thunder, but I am happy to share that Xylem is well ahead of schedule and reducing carbon emissions. Since 2019, we reduced our greenhouse gas intensity by 12%, across Scope 1 and 2 emissions. We've also driven our own water use down by more than 20% and doubled our rate of water recycling versus just 3 years ago.  The rigor and transparency of our reporting reflect our commitment to accountability as a sustainability leader. So I invite you to dig into the report when it comes out because sustainability is so fundamental to our strategic differentiation to our investment thesis and to our growth.  Now I'll turn it back over to Sandy for more color on our outlook and guide.\nSandra Rowland: Thanks, Patrick. Consistent with our previous presentations, we have provided key facts for each end market in the appendix. We expect healthy underlying demand will continue through the remainder of the year with modestly better volumes and stronger price realization across our end markets.  Our end market outlook remains largely consistent with the view we offered last quarter with a few notable changes. We continue to expect our utility business to grow low single digits. On the wastewater side, we expect low to mid-single-digit growth on resilient global demand. We anticipate wastewater demand in emerging markets to continue being driven by investment in public utilities, healthy OpEx activity as well as the benefit of our localization strategy. One note though is some shift to the second half due to the impacts from COVID closures in China.  The outlook for longer-term capital project spending and bid activity remains very solid globally. On the clean water side, we continue to expect demand to remain very robust as the AMI and the advantages of a static meters continue to gain momentum with an increasingly broad spectrum of utilities.  With double-digit revenue growth in the second half on improving chip supply, we expect full year revenues to be flat. We expect continued momentum in our Test and assessment services businesses due to increasing focus on infrastructure and climate challenges.  Please turn to Slide 11. Looking at the industrial end market, we continue to expect mid-single-digit growth on steady demand for our solutions globally. We foresee healthy growth in dewatering, especially in emerging markets from robust mining demand and our channel expansion strategy. In the U.S. and Western Europe, we expect solid order rates and backlog expansion as activity continues to ramp in light industrial applications with considerable traction from new product introductions and large account activity in Western Europe.  The commercial end market is now expected to deliver mid-single to high single-digit growth, up from mid-single-digit growth on solid replacement activity and new product introductions in the U.S. and Europe. In residential, our smallest end market, we now expect mid-single-digit growth up from low single-digit to mid-single-digit growth on healthy demand.  And now let's turn to Slide 12, and I'll walk you through our updated guidance. As Patrick mentioned, our outperformance in the first quarter is giving us risk momentum, and we are increasing full year guidance for organic revenue growth and raising the low end of the adjusted EPS range. I want to take a moment to walk you through the puts and takes of how we now see the full year. We are lifting full year organic revenue growth to 4% to 6%, up from 3% to 5%. The 1% organic growth increase is driven primarily by stronger price realization. But from a reporting perspective, we anticipate it will be offset by a lower euro.  We are narrowing the EPS range to $2.40 to $2.70, which boosts the low end from $2.35. This reflects strong price realization, which will be partially offset by inflation and the euro FX headwinds. The emerging impact from a weakening euro is significant to us. Our initial full year guidance assumed a euro of 1.13. Our updated guidance now assumes the euro at 1.05, which is a $0.10 headwind to the full year EPS guide.  For your reference, we have included an FX sensitivity table in the appendix. We will closely monitor the global supply chain environment and continue to proactively manage impact from China's COVID lockdowns and the secondary effects of the warrant in Ukraine.  On Slide 13, we've shown how our guidance breaks down by segment. We continue to expect mid-single-digit growth in water infrastructure, high single-digit growth in Applied Water, up from mid-single-digit growth due to stronger price. We continue to expect Measurement & Control Solutions to be flattish. This assumes down roughly double digits in the first half of the year and up double digits in the second half. Although growth is still likely to be constrained by the gradual return of chip supply as the year progresses.  For 2022, we still expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of 16% to 17%. And this yields adjusted EPS range of $2.40 to $2.70 that I just mentioned. And we still expect free cash flow conversion to be 100% of net income. We have also provided you with a number of other full year assumptions on the slide to supplement your models.  And now drilling down on the second quarter. We anticipate total company organic revenues will be flattish to up 1%. This includes low single-digit growth in Water Infrastructure and mid-single-digit growth in Applied Water, and M&CS is expected to decline low double digits. We expect second quarter adjusted EBITDA margin to be in the range of 14.5% to 15%, a sequential improvement over the prior quarter.  And with that, please turn to Slide 14, and I'll turn the call back over to Patrick for closing comments.\nPatrick Decker: Thanks, Sandy. We came into 2022 in a strong and enviable position, even in the face of headwinds from chip supply and inflation. Our performance in the first quarter has shown the team's ability to capitalize on our market leadership and deliver with discipline despite the various challenges around the world.  Demand has never been greater, we have strong commercial momentum, and we have a powerful balance sheet giving us strategic flexibility. And we have a great team showing resilience, agility and experience in managing the dynamics of a truly global business.  While our customers are as local as water is, the biggest water challenges are global, and the water sector is increasingly well networked internationally. Still, Xylem is one of only a small handful of global water players. That puts us in a strong position to play a leadership role in support of both the sector and our mission to solve water. So as you likely saw in our March announcement, we made the decision to move Xylem's headquarters to Washington, D.C., which is one of the main crossroads of the global water sector. Washington is not just the seat of U.S. water policy. It's where water thought leaders from all over the world convene, including the private sector, governments from around the world, multilaterals, academia and civil society.  We've also taken the opportunity of the move to reimagine our footprint for more flexible ways of working and simplifying and leaning our headquarters. The new location is on Water Street. Yes, it's on Water Street, right on the Anacostia River. We'll be officially opening the space in mid-June, and I look forward to welcoming all of you when you visit D.C.  Before turning to your questions, I have one more special note of thanks. This is Matt Latino's last quarterly earnings call at the helm of Investor Relations. We previously announced that Matt is taking a new role in Xylem, and it's an exciting new chapter for him. I know from comments so many of you have made over the years that you deeply value Matt's energy, accessibility and professionalism, and I benefited from his insightful counsel and his persistent positive encouragement through every kind of circumstance. So thank you, Matt.  Some of you have already met Andrea Vanderberg, who's taking the reins as our Investor Relations leader. Andrea has had great impact as the Head of Financial Planning and Analysis for Xylem. So she brings distinctively deep knowledge of the business to her leadership of IR. I'm confident you'll really enjoy getting to know Andrea and will find great value in working with her and from her insights and perspectives.  Now operator, I'll turn the call over to you for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And we'll take our first question from Deane Dray with RBC Capital.\nDeane Dray: Good morning, everyone. Maybe we can start with MC&S and just more encouraging news on the chip shortage front. Can you give us a sense, now you've got record backlog that is -- I'd be interested in hearing what the implied margins are. And maybe some sense about -- so customers are giving you these orders, knowing they're going to be delayed to a degree. So it doesn't sound like you've lost any competitive positioning there. So maybe we can start there.\nPatrick Decker: Sure, Deane. I'll start with the latter half of your question, then I'll have Sandy speak to the margin profile in more detail. You're right. I mean, we've -- I think the team has done a great job working both with the suppliers of chips, but also with our customers on hanging on to deals and backlog. So we've had no losses of deals here in terms of cancellations. Also, what we're seeing is really good traction in terms of momentum, especially around midsized utilities as we're seeing greater adoption there as well, which is really encouraging. And so it smooths out kind of what our demand is going to be over time. . What we would say on the chip supply, as we said in our comments, is that we've seen a gradual recovery. And so we're not changing our outlook for the full year. It's just more confident in terms of what we're seeing there. So really encouraging.  Sandy, do you want to speak more to the margin profile?\nSandra Rowland: Yes. Thanks, Patrick. I think, Deane, when we look at the profile of the orders that we've been bringing in, we're really encouraged about the margin structure. It's accretive to the company. And as you already know, this business gets really good leverage. I think you can see that already when you look at this quarter sequential improvement even from Q4 to Q1, where we've had about a $20 million pickup in revenue and seeing very good margin recovery as the revenue line grows. So very satisfied with the profile of the orders that we've been bringing in.\nPatrick Decker: Not out of the woods yet, Deane. I mean, obviously, still risk there, but we think we've got that embedded in our guide for the full year.\nDeane Dray: That's really helpful. And then the follow-up question are on the recent headwinds. And look, FX has always been -- we know your exposure, that's the math, and I'm glad you've laid that all out. But how about reflect on China, it's roughly 8% of revenues, just true me up on that. And how -- what's the expectations on how this plays out? We know your headquarters is in Shanghai, and just some real-time update and expectations of the reopening.\nPatrick Decker: Sure, Deane. Yes, so our revenue exposure is roughly $350 million, about 7% of our total revenue. The impact in the first quarter was about $20 million in revenue. Our guide implies another $20 million in Q2. So first half of the year right now will be down about 20% in revenue. Second half, we expect to be up about 20% because we saw some of the impacts of lockdown even in the fourth quarter, still lingering in China.  We've got 4 factories in China. As you said, we got our headquarters in Shanghai. Three of those factories were closed for a few weeks. Later, they opened up at 50% capacity. All 4 of our sites right now are 100% at utilization. Our Nanjing plant, which is the one that supports our Applied Water business, it actually never closed. And that's the reason why AWS actually had mid-single-digit growth in China here in the first quarter.  So we expect there to be a gradual opening in China. We think it's all manageable within our guide. Obviously, there's a risk there. But our people are all safe and sound and they're working their backsides off to make sure we deliver on our commitments.  We did talk about also that there is the global supply chain effect. And we think that's the one that really is kind of the wild card going into the second half of the year, but we feel that we've got that embedded in our guide.\nDeane Dray: That's all helpful. And just lastly, with all the comings and goings, I want to wish Colin all the best. We'll miss him. He's a class act, great insights on the water sector. For Matt, well-deserved promotion. I still have his cell phone, just let them know that possibility. And welcome to Andrea as well.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Mike Halloran with Baird.\nMichael Halloran: I just want to echo Dean's comments on the comings and goings. So first, on the utility side of the equation, it's kind of a broad question because it's both for the wastewater and the water side. But you look at the tailwinds that are emerging there, really across regions. And it just feels like there's a lot of momentum, particularly with the backlog, the underlying demand where tax receipts are, et cetera. If you take a step back, and obviously, you've got some geopolitical concerns out there, but what do you think could derail that momentum at this point? It seems like it's on a pretty good track.\nPatrick Decker: I think the -- it's a great question, Mike. I think from a demand standpoint, we don't see many storm clouds on the horizon here right now, just where we are in the overall investment cycle. I know some may have questions even around what's happening in Europe from a geopolitical standpoint and focus on moving towards oil and gas alternatives, et cetera, will money be derailed or directed there. That's not even the way that the funding mechanisms work in Europe from a water utility standpoint. So we think even that's pretty robust at this point in time. . I think the -- I think in the near term, the challenges remain, in our case, chip supply and just being able to continue to execute what we have in our pipeline. Our bidding pipeline remains very healthy, north of almost $2.5 billion in the bidding pipeline at this point in time. So again, I'm paid to be paranoid. So we're looking at any storm clout there that we could possibly see. But it feels pretty healthy right now.\nMichael Halloran: How far out are your backlog stretching at this point? And how do you think about the conversions? Just -- and that's more of a broad comment. And I'm hoping you can compare that to what a typical conversion cycle looks like. We all know that everything is getting stretched into 2023, given the chip shortages. But help give some magnitude for how far out do you have visibility at this point?\nSandra Rowland: Yes. I think great question. And obviously, it varies by segment. When we look at our AWS segment, that's where we typically carry a very small backlog. But as we look over the past 18 months there, orders have really been high, and we've been constrained from a delivery perspective because of supply chain challenges. So in that case there, we have a backlog that gives us really good coverage for the next couple of quarters out.  In water infrastructure, it's a little bit of a mixed bag. We have some short-cycle businesses there, and we have some longer cycle businesses there. And so in the shorter cycle, we have coverage as we look out for more coverage than we typically have as we look out for the rest of the year. And M&CS, the story there is we keep getting orders that are outpacing the amount of revenue that we're able to deliver. And I think it's going to take us about 2 years to catch up on the demand that we have today and the balance between supply chain.\nPatrick Decker: And Mike, I would just -- I would offer up, I think to your question around visibility from an overall market sentiment standpoint, our bidding pipeline, especially in the treatment and on the wastewater side being treatment and even on the clean water side being metrology, we've got visibility there and a bidding pipeline of at least 2 to 3 years out. And that's why we're speaking with the level of confidence around what the overall market sentiment is.\nMichael Halloran: And then a follow-up then it's the capital deployment side, you've been pretty constructive in the last few quarters on what the pipeline looks like? And it seems optimistic on your ability to convert some of that pipeline? Maybe just an update on what you're seeing in the market and how actionable it is.\nPatrick Decker: Sure. Yes. So we still feel really good, Mike, about the pipeline in terms of opportunities, and they range from larger opportunities of moves into various end markets. But even in the small- to medium-sized opportunities that are there. We've got some things here that we're pretty excited about in the near term that hopefully, we'll be able to execute on. So more to say there over the coming quarter or 2. But in general sense, we -- I feel -- certainly, we feel the M&A pipeline is as healthy as it's ever been. But we're -- we continue to be disciplined on valuation.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Connor Lynagh with Morgan Stanley. .\nConnor Lynagh: Just wanted to follow up on that capital allocation conversation. So given what the share price has done, I'm assuming that you would be less interested in using share currency for deals. But just curious how you view the calculus of that, how you think about share repurchases? How do you -- the competing uses of capital between organic investment, M&A and buybacks and sort of how you pay for M&A?\nPatrick Decker: Sure. Yes. So again, we come into the year with a really strong balance sheet. Sandy laid out what our firepower is at this point in time, and we are not hesitant to do deals. Obviously, we're going to be disciplined around valuation. I would not preclude equity from being used in the right situation, but it's not our first lever to really lean in on around capital deployment in general.  We also don't see M&A and any repurchase of shares being at odds with each other. In the past, we've used share repurchase authorization that we have out there right now to offset dilution of our long-term incentive grants. But we realize now there are time to be opportunistic given the current environment. And again, we think we're able to be both opportunistic on share repurchase as well as still do strategic M&A. These are not binary decisions, in our case.\nConnor Lynagh: Makes sense. And I just wanted to follow up on a separate line of questioning from earlier, which is basically, it seems like your customers at this point have to be pretty aware of what's going on in chip supply chain. I'm curious, have they changed their behavior around awarding new contracts? Is most of the ordering that you're seeing related to existing customer relationships or at the pace of sort of newer deployments, stayed steady, accelerated, decelerated?  And on the other side, are you changing how much you're bidding? Where -- in terms of time line or how aggressive you're being on some of these bigger projects given the time to deliver.\nPatrick Decker: Sure. Great question. So let me parse it apart a bit. In terms of kind of existing contracts and deals, we've seen no cancellations there. Our customers are very well aware of the challenges. In many cases, they've got multisource, and so they're seeing the same thing from our competitors along the way. So they realized that we're not alone here.  But -- secondly, it's the fact that so much work has gone into getting the regulatory approval of these large AMI deployments. The returns on investment for them are so substantial in terms of revenue generation that they just want to continue to move forward and execute these things. And so the likelihood of them going back is minimized in that context.  Are they frustrated? Of course, we all are. But we've been weathering this for a while now, and we've been working closely with them to find alternatives to meet their needs, even though it may not be the level of metrology they originally spec, it's good enough right now to move forward, but still with a clear view of what the original approved implementation is going to look like.  In terms of new deals, yes, this is not just with existing customers. We're winning a number of new customers along the way, especially in that medium-sized part of the utility sector, which is really encouraging for us. In terms of changing our own behavior, we are -- we've been very disciplined along the way on being very open and forthright on what delivery frictions are right now so that we are not overpromising and underdelivering to any new deals that we're winning. We're being very clear about that. And I think customers appreciate that transparency as I'm sure our competitors are being transparent as well with them on what their own delivery lead times are.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Nathan Jones with Stifel.\nNathan Jones: Patrick, I'd like to follow up on some of the comments there about medium-sized utilities starting to adopt this AMI technology. All of the conferences I've been going to, which, admittedly, are probably larger utilities that are attending those. But it seems like the shift to AMI is going to become ubiquitous here and it's -- the inflection point has been hit, and I don't think there's any doubt that, that's getting adopted. So it's definitely encouraging to hear about medium-sized utilities beginning to get on board with that kind of stuff.  Can you talk about the market opportunity that, that present? Because I know a few years ago, when you bought Sensus, that was really targeting those larger and leading utilities to try and drive that waterfall down into the market. So just any update you can give us on what you're seeing out there, what that market opportunity could be, how long that drives this high level of order growth for you?\nPatrick Decker: Sure, Nate. Again, good question. You're right. We have been very focused on the large utilities initially because, in many cases, as you will know from the conferences that you attend. Oftentimes, the medium to smaller utilities are looking to some of the larger ones that will lead in terms of proven technology, et cetera, but not always. I mean they've got their own minds and their own investment plans. . Oftentimes, for those medium utilities, they're looking at entire implementations of AMI as opposed to maybe for a larger metro area, it could be sections of a city. So when they make the decision to go full scale, it takes them a little bit longer to make that decision because it's a bigger strategic choice for them to make. And so it is encouraging to see that level of adoption happening.  They also -- their timing typically is tied more to the retirement of the existing metrology deployment that they have within their cities or communities. And so we see this as being a really healthy, steady stream of conversion over time because while they may study AMI for a while, getting ready for a complete upgrade or overhaul. These things are phased out over time. It's not going to happen all within a few years. It's going to be staged out over a decade or more, at least across the course of the U.S.\nNathan Jones: Which has been good for long-term demand trends. I think is the point that I'm trying to get to out of that, that you should have that steady stream of continued orders in the M&CS business. I just want to ask one on. Go ahead.\nPatrick Decker: Nathan, sorry, just really quickly, I mean, just another data point for you. I know you're aware of this and maybe others are not. I mean, again, when you think about the U.S. alone, we're talking about more than 50,000 water utilities, and the largest majority of those are small to medium size. So that's why we're so excited about this part of the market. And still less than half of that market has adopted AMI.\nNathan Jones: Yes. I did want to ask one on price cost. The mass saving this morning shows you about $35 million negative on price cost, and that's responsible for a large portion of the margin compression that you saw year-over-year. Great to see that pricing step up from 200 basis points in the fourth quarter to 420 basis points in this quarter. Can you talk about the outlook for continuing to close that gap and to generate more price to cover the inflation that you're seeing in the business?\nSandra Rowland: Yes. Great question. Great question, Nate. This is something that our teams have been very focused on. And since we saw inflation start to rise last year, we've implemented numerous price increases. In some cases, we had to work through existing backlog before the new prices took effect. And so we saw a big step up from Q4 to Q1 in our price realization. And as we look forward throughout the year, we would expect that to continue to ramp in each successive quarter. . As we look at Q1, we -- our price did cover material inflation and freight. But you're right, we were still underwater. We didn't cover sort of our labor inflation, our overhead inflation. As we look out to Q2, we expect that to be neutral. And then in the second half of the year, price should outpace the inflation effects.  And I think it is important to note in our guide, we did increase it for stronger price realization based on what we experienced in Q1 and what our outlook is for the next quarter. And we also did up our inflation outlook.\nNathan Jones: So the point there is that by the second half of the year, those price and inflation numbers that you put on the first page of the slide deck are going -- price is going to cover all of that inflation?\nSandra Rowland: That's our expectation.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Brian Lee with Goldman Sachs.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Miguel on for Brian Lee. I just had 2 quick ones, follow-up questions from the prior questions. On price/cost real quick. So price/cost was seemed negative in the first quarter. I think that was expected, and then you just mentioned you expect it to improve for the rest of the year. Is the expectation still for the full year that the price cost would be positive?\nSandra Rowland: That's our expectation for the full year. Yes.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. That's helpful. And then I appreciate all the additional color on the backlog on M&CS. So the backlog gives you visibility on orders for, I think you said next 2 to 3 years. I know you haven't seen any cancellations yet, but at what point would customers consider canceling orders if the lead times become so stretched out? Or maybe is there a way to think about it, where are customers intentionally placing orders well in advance of projects to get their spot in line? Hopefully, that makes sense.\nPatrick Decker: Sure. Yes. So we've not seen any -- there's been no double ordering in that regard. I mean, the team is very disciplined around that. And the nice thing about these large metrology implementations is we know exactly what the endpoint count is that they need. And so we work very closely with our customers there to make sure that we're not taking duplicate orders.  We are prioritizing customers. We have someone allocation. Obviously, we're trying to prioritize those that are most stressed at this point in time. You never say never on these things in terms of at some point in time, somebody canceling. But I think, again, as I mentioned earlier, the customers understand that there are a few other alternatives and these implementations have gone through such a rigorous long-range regulatory approvals, and they're so critical to their own revenue generation capability that as long as we're able to meet their kind of basic demand as best we can and give them as full transparency as possible, we've been very proud and very pleased in working with them as well as with our chip suppliers. We talk a lot about the customers.  We are working as closely as possible with our suppliers to redesign a number of our chip requirements for next generation. We're redesigning our own products to meet minimum needs here in the immediate term. There's -- it's a multifaceted angle here, and that's why I'm so proud of the effort of the team to navigate this, including our customers' patients.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Andrew Buscaglia with Berenberg.\nAndrew Buscaglia: I wanted to -- just looking at your organic growth guidance range. So underlying that applied water is really the only one you nudged up. I was surprised, Water Infrastructure, you weren't willing to take that up. And can you -- could you comment on that, first off? And then secondly, shouldn't we start to see some of like the benefits of this water infrastructure stimulus bear fruit later this year? Or what are you guys thinking on that front?\nSandra Rowland: Yes. I think when we looked at adjusting our revenue guide and our forecast, the primary reason that we adjusted it is for a stronger price realization, and we're seeing that in AWS more than any other segment. As we look out for the rest of the year, we're still monitoring chip supply for the other segments. And water infrastructure has a high concentration in China. When we saw the impacts in Q1 from China, they were largely concentrated in water infrastructure, and that's also where we'll see the impact in Q2.\nPatrick Decker: And on the infrastructure bill, no real meaningful change there. I mean we do think it's going to be a positive over time. I don't really see that being a big impact here in '22 as things continue to settle out. We see that more as a benefit in '23 and beyond.\nAndrew Buscaglia: No. Okay. Okay. And then just to be clear, so you obviously expect some nice price cost tailwinds in the back half of the year. But based on your Q2 guidance, it really does assume a pretty big step-up in margins in the second half. Is there anything else specifically that would provide that tailwind beyond just price cost? Or is it recent cost savings or anything that you expect will drive higher incrementals or something like that?\nSandra Rowland: It's really four things. You touched on the first thing. The first thing is price cost, and that will continue to improve throughout the year. The second thing is chip supply and M&CS as that revenue ramps in the second half, it has very good contribution margins. The third point, I would say is China. We have a very modest we have revenue declines in the first half in China. We're expecting to see a good pop in the back half in China. And then we announced today some leadership changes. We're pursuing some simplification opportunities and some of those will drive cost savings in the back half of the year as well.\nAndrew Buscaglia: Okay. Yes. And presumably, free cash flow, same thing, you're in kind of a hole in Q1, but as that EBITDA goes up, you'll generate more cash and then I assume working capital management probably takes over from there.\nSandra Rowland: Yes. What we saw from a free cash flow perspective in Q1 is very much in line with our historical patterns. We typically use cash in the first quarter. As we work through the rest of the year, one of the things you may note is that our inventory balance is up. That was purposeful. We've taken on some incremental inventory to try to mitigate some of the impacts of the supply chain challenges. And we're going to be thoughtful as we try to work that down in the back half of the year. .\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Scott Graham with Loop Capital Markets.\nScott Graham: Patrick, Sandy and once again, congrats, Matt. You'll be great. So I have -- sorry to beat the dead horse here on this, Sandy, but the pricing and the price cost. I think I heard you say during your prepared comments that you had increased your assumption for inflation I'm just wondering whatever other metrics you can give us around pricing would be helpful, whether it's where you're expecting that ramp to go in the second quarter, what your full year pricing will be because the gap is still pretty large right now. So anything you can give us on pricing to give us a little bit more color on what you mean by ramp.\nSandra Rowland: Yes. I think just to give you some context, Scott, in Q4, we had about 200 basis points impacts from our price increases. That doubled to 400 basis points in Q1, and we would expect that to continue to increase. Now since the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, we've seen some of our commodities increase, our costs, particularly around stainless steel, which is impacted by nickel.  And so as we roll forward inflation assumptions for the next 3 quarters, we see more headwinds in the neighborhood of $40 million to $50 million. And so in response to that, our teams have gone out and implemented incremental price actions, some that they were not contemplated when we put together our budget. And so our teams are acting quickly. We've changed some of the practices around price increases. We used to have over a 60-day lag time between when we announced a price increase and when it went into effect. And now we're down to less than 2 weeks across our businesses.\nPatrick Decker: And I would just offer up, Scott, that again, I think what we've been really pleased with is the resilience of our volume and our share. And in some cases, even gaining share in certain parts of the business. And so we -- the market really has shown a level of resilience in this area. And I think, again, we've been acting as a leader in this area. And pleased and as things continue to move from an inflationary standpoint, we'll continue to act responsibly. .\nSandra Rowland: The other thing I would add, Scott, is the impact on our margins is price/cost has gotten a lot of attention. The secondary impact is mixed. When you look at our revenue mix, with M&CS being down this year, the revenue that we've lost because of the chip supply constraints comes with high margins.\nScott Graham: Get it. I was going to say who would have thought utilities would have given up so much on pricing, but it's a brave new world out there. Okay. My other 2 questions are around, can you -- what is the percentage of the backlog for M&CS that is being held up by the shortages, if you got it, you could ship it kind of thing, what's that percentage?\nSandra Rowland: Yes. So I think if you look at our M&CS backlog, it's around $2 billion. And we have I would say, between 20% and 25% of that backlog is held up by the tip delays. And that's been growing each quarter because our orders have been outpacing our revenue conversion.\nScott Graham: Yes. Got it. And then lastly, Sandy, I know as you entered here, I guess, over a year ago now. I don't know, have you ever calculated it or you and Tony calculated, what is the organic sales rate that you guys need to generate a certain level of operating leverage. Is it 3%, 5%? I mean, how do you look at that?\nSandra Rowland: I'm not sure I totally follow your question, Scott. I think we -- when we model our long-range plan, we understand assumptions around inflation. We also set productivity targets across our organization, both in the manufacturing centers and across the functions. And we have a goal as an enterprise for productivity to outpace inflation. Now the past 18 months have been a little bit different, but that's our overall philosophy.\nPatrick Decker: And I think, Scott, the -- I mean, just some other -- trying to parse out your question here. I mean if you think about the incrementals in this business, I mean any dollar of growth that we get in this business is going to drop very healthy incrementals to the bottom line between the 30%, 40% range. In terms of what we've laid out in our long-term guide is in that mid-single-digit range, which, obviously, really drives heavy margin expansion, especially given the mix with M&CS. So maybe that helps frame out a little bit. But I mean, this is a business that generates very healthy incrementals at whatever level of growth there is.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James.\nPavel Molchanov: First, on the M&A front, you -- given that blue chip companies such as ourselves are struggling with semiconductor and other component availability, presumably safe to say some smaller players are struggling even more. Does that create any kind of opportunistic quasi distressed M&A opportunities that perhaps you would not have seen a year ago?\nPatrick Decker: It's an interesting angle. It's not really one that we're prioritizing right now. I mean the things that we have in the pipeline, again, we really focus on the strategic logic behind them in terms of for the long run. We kind of look through this cycle in terms of chip demand. I understand where you're coming from with the question. But I wouldn't say that, that's really heightened our view on any particular asset based upon chip distress.\nPavel Molchanov: Understood. Following up on Europe, the weakness in the currency, does that reflect any underlying softness in kind of European GDP and demand patterns that might impact the volume in the second half of the year?\nPatrick Decker: Not as we see it. Based upon our experience in Europe over many years, Europe is very resilient when it comes to underlying demand. So it's a much heavier OpEx element there in terms of repair replacement of installed infrastructure. It's less reliant on new CapEx. And even when there is new CapEx, the funding mechanisms tend to be pretty well sheltered, at least, in the larger economies across Europe. I'm not saying there are no economies that are not immune to it, but we've really never seen big swings there on the CapEx side.  In terms of what we do see is the lion's share of our business there is repair and replacement, which is very stable, very steady as well as really attractive margins. And so we feel pretty confident right now around the outlook for Europe as we see it today.\nMatthew Latino: Ashley, I think -- do we have any more questions?\nOperator: Yes, I apologize. We'll go next to Joe Giordano with Cowen.\nJoseph Giordano: We talked a lot about price, but just curious how you think about -- like is there a level where it just the amount of price that's required to increase, it just starts causing demand destruction because projects start to be -- to not make sense and customers I understand why you're raising, but I'm just not going to buy right now?\nPatrick Decker: Joe, it's something that our teams stay close to every day. That's one of the biggest challenges, obviously, in this kind of inflationary environment is where is that limit. And we're always looking at win-loss ratios. We leverage our capabilities in sales force and our bidding pipeline there to get a feel for what that trade-off is. And so the team stays very close to that. And we look at that on a regular basis. And so until we see meaningful moves in that win-loss ratio, that tells us that we need to continue to make sure we cover the inflationary impacts.  What we're encouraged by thus far is that in the areas where we've taken price increases, we continue to see volume growth in those businesses. And so that's a good healthy indicator as well. But it's not something by any means, Joe, that we take for granted, something we're very, very close to.\nJoseph Giordano: And last, Patrick, I think raising the low end of the guide as it was such an important kind of tone here for you guys. But just on the other side of that, was there thoughts on trimming the high end and maybe talk through your thoughts around that and what the scenario is that gets you there this year?\nPatrick Decker: Sure. Yes. I mean, yes, you can imagine all management teams spend a lot of time thinking about when you make a change in guidance and how you want to approach that. We just felt that it was prudent at this point in time and confident to raise the lower end. Trimming the top end, we still see a path there. And obviously, things have to go in the right direction. But -- and obviously, there are clouds on the horizon that every company is seeing right now, but we see a path there, and we'll continue to monitor that. . In terms of what those are, it's what we've talked about before. We need to continue to see pricing momentum. We need to continue to see improvements in the chip supply and delivery around those areas. And hopefully, we'll see some improvement on the outlook for China. China is not a demand issue for us. It's really a matter of when we're able to ship out our backlog there as well as mitigate what the downstream impacts on the supply chain are.\nOperator: And there are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back over to Patrick Decker for additional or closing remarks.\nPatrick Decker: Well, thank you all again for your time and attention this morning and for your support, and I look forward to catching up with you between now and the next earnings call. In the meantime, stay safe, stay well, and I wish you all the very best. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And this does conclude today's Xylem First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Please disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Sandra Rowland",
            "content": "Thanks, Patrick. Please turn to Slide 4, and I'll give some additional color on our first quarter results. Given the quarter's challenges, the team did a great job delivering on our commitments with particularly strong performance on price and backlog execution. Revenue growth was healthy in all regions, led by a double-digit result in Western Europe and mid-single-digit gains in the U.S. In emerging markets, revenues grew high single digits excluding China, which was affected by COVID shutdowns.  In a moment, I'll offer detailed performance by segment. But in short, utilities was down 3%. Strength in Western Europe was offset by ongoing chip supply constraints and their outsized impact on our smart metering business in the U.S. Industrial grew 10% on increasing activity in all geographies, excluding China, with particular strength in Western Europe. Commercial was up 11%, led by healthy growth in the U.S., and residential was up 15%, also driven by the U.S. Organic orders were up 14% in the quarter. As Patrick mentioned, the quarter set historically high order intake with robust demand for our technologies across all segments.  EBITDA margin was 14.2%, which was above our guided range, primarily driven by stronger-than-expected price realization. Year-over-year EBITDA margin contracted 290 basis points. We got healthy price realization and productivity benefits, but they were more than offset by inflation, and lower volumes from chip shortages impacting our higher-margin smart metering solutions. As previously mentioned, we'll continue to offset inflation with progressive price realization. Our EPS in the quarter was $0.47.  Please turn to Slide 5, and I'll review the quarter's segment performance in a bit more detail. Water Infrastructure orders in the quarter were up 12% organically versus last year, with growth underpinned by sustained demand in our wastewater utility business in the U.S. and Western Europe and increasing demand for dewatering, particularly in emerging markets.  Water Infrastructure revenue was up 8% in the quarter. Industrial remained strong, and we saw revenue acceleration in our U.S. wastewater utility business as prior quarter order to revenue conversion delays eased.  Geographically, results were mixed for the segment. The U.S. and Western Europe were up mid-double digits driven by treatment deliveries in the U.S. and healthy utility OpEx in both regions. Emerging markets was down low double digits due to a challenging prior year compare in China and impacts from the recent COVID lockdown. EBITDA margin for the segment was down 140 basis points a strong price realization and productivity benefits were more than offset by inflation and investments.  Please turn to Page 6. In the Applied Water segment, first quarter orders were up 8% organically, led by price and underlying global demand. Revenues increased 10% on strong backlog execution across all end markets, along with solid price realization.  Geographically, the U.S. was up mid-double digits. All end markets showed strength, and we benefited from the traction of new product launches. Western Europe delivered high single-digit growth with healthy gains across all end markets, and increased activity in large industrial accounts.  Emerging Markets was up mid-single digits on backlog execution and activity. Segment EBITDA margin declined 380 basis points in the quarter. Similar to water infrastructure, we delivered solid price realization and productivity benefits, but they were more than offset by inflation.  And now let's turn to Slide 7, and I'll cover our Measurement & Control Solutions business. M&CS orders grew 25% organically in the quarter, reflecting continued strong demand for our metrology solutions as well as healthy demand and pipeline assessment services.  While a portion of our M&CS backlog includes orders that have been delayed due to chip shortages, our M&CS backlog is up 60% versus the prior year. It is now more than $2 billion. As we anticipated, revenue declined 9% due to constrained chip supply. We are encouraged by the gradual improvement in availability, and we realized significant quarter sequential gains. It's worth noting that the growing metrology backlog is both margin accretive and resilient. There have been no cancellations of AMI awards.  Geographically, Western Europe and emerging markets were flat with some growth from our pipeline assessment services business. Chip shortages pressed U.S. revenues down 14%. Segment EBITDA margin in the quarter was down 470 basis points compared to the prior year, but higher than last quarter. As we've noted in previous calls, the business gets very strong operating leverage from higher volumes and revenues, and those are still being held back by the supply-constrained conversion of orders. We were able to partially offset those effects with price and productivity gains.  And now let's turn to Slide 8 for an overview of cash flows and our balance sheet. Consistent with typical seasonality patterns, we used cash in the first quarter. This year, we also strategically increased safety stocks to mitigate supply chain volatility and are carrying higher inventory balances.  Our financial position remains robust with $1.1 billion in cash and available liquidity of approximately $1.9 billion. Net debt-to-EBITDA leverage is 1.5x.  And please turn to Slide 9, and I'll hand the call back over to Patrick to look forward at the rest of the year. Thanks, Patrick. Consistent with our previous presentations, we have provided key facts for each end market in the appendix. We expect healthy underlying demand will continue through the remainder of the year with modestly better volumes and stronger price realization across our end markets.  Our end market outlook remains largely consistent with the view we offered last quarter with a few notable changes. We continue to expect our utility business to grow low single digits. On the wastewater side, we expect low to mid-single-digit growth on resilient global demand. We anticipate wastewater demand in emerging markets to continue being driven by investment in public utilities, healthy OpEx activity as well as the benefit of our localization strategy. One note though is some shift to the second half due to the impacts from COVID closures in China.  The outlook for longer-term capital project spending and bid activity remains very solid globally. On the clean water side, we continue to expect demand to remain very robust as the AMI and the advantages of a static meters continue to gain momentum with an increasingly broad spectrum of utilities.  With double-digit revenue growth in the second half on improving chip supply, we expect full year revenues to be flat. We expect continued momentum in our Test and assessment services businesses due to increasing focus on infrastructure and climate challenges.  Please turn to Slide 11. Looking at the industrial end market, we continue to expect mid-single-digit growth on steady demand for our solutions globally. We foresee healthy growth in dewatering, especially in emerging markets from robust mining demand and our channel expansion strategy. In the U.S. and Western Europe, we expect solid order rates and backlog expansion as activity continues to ramp in light industrial applications with considerable traction from new product introductions and large account activity in Western Europe.  The commercial end market is now expected to deliver mid-single to high single-digit growth, up from mid-single-digit growth on solid replacement activity and new product introductions in the U.S. and Europe. In residential, our smallest end market, we now expect mid-single-digit growth up from low single-digit to mid-single-digit growth on healthy demand.  And now let's turn to Slide 12, and I'll walk you through our updated guidance. As Patrick mentioned, our outperformance in the first quarter is giving us risk momentum, and we are increasing full year guidance for organic revenue growth and raising the low end of the adjusted EPS range. I want to take a moment to walk you through the puts and takes of how we now see the full year. We are lifting full year organic revenue growth to 4% to 6%, up from 3% to 5%. The 1% organic growth increase is driven primarily by stronger price realization. But from a reporting perspective, we anticipate it will be offset by a lower euro.  We are narrowing the EPS range to $2.40 to $2.70, which boosts the low end from $2.35. This reflects strong price realization, which will be partially offset by inflation and the euro FX headwinds. The emerging impact from a weakening euro is significant to us. Our initial full year guidance assumed a euro of 1.13. Our updated guidance now assumes the euro at 1.05, which is a $0.10 headwind to the full year EPS guide.  For your reference, we have included an FX sensitivity table in the appendix. We will closely monitor the global supply chain environment and continue to proactively manage impact from China's COVID lockdowns and the secondary effects of the warrant in Ukraine.  On Slide 13, we've shown how our guidance breaks down by segment. We continue to expect mid-single-digit growth in water infrastructure, high single-digit growth in Applied Water, up from mid-single-digit growth due to stronger price. We continue to expect Measurement & Control Solutions to be flattish. This assumes down roughly double digits in the first half of the year and up double digits in the second half. Although growth is still likely to be constrained by the gradual return of chip supply as the year progresses.  For 2022, we still expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of 16% to 17%. And this yields adjusted EPS range of $2.40 to $2.70 that I just mentioned. And we still expect free cash flow conversion to be 100% of net income. We have also provided you with a number of other full year assumptions on the slide to supplement your models.  And now drilling down on the second quarter. We anticipate total company organic revenues will be flattish to up 1%. This includes low single-digit growth in Water Infrastructure and mid-single-digit growth in Applied Water, and M&CS is expected to decline low double digits. We expect second quarter adjusted EBITDA margin to be in the range of 14.5% to 15%, a sequential improvement over the prior quarter.  And with that, please turn to Slide 14, and I'll turn the call back over to Patrick for closing comments. Yes. Thanks, Patrick. I think, Deane, when we look at the profile of the orders that we've been bringing in, we're really encouraged about the margin structure. It's accretive to the company. And as you already know, this business gets really good leverage. I think you can see that already when you look at this quarter sequential improvement even from Q4 to Q1, where we've had about a $20 million pickup in revenue and seeing very good margin recovery as the revenue line grows. So very satisfied with the profile of the orders that we've been bringing in. Yes. I think great question. And obviously, it varies by segment. When we look at our AWS segment, that's where we typically carry a very small backlog. But as we look over the past 18 months there, orders have really been high, and we've been constrained from a delivery perspective because of supply chain challenges. So in that case there, we have a backlog that gives us really good coverage for the next couple of quarters out.  In water infrastructure, it's a little bit of a mixed bag. We have some short-cycle businesses there, and we have some longer cycle businesses there. And so in the shorter cycle, we have coverage as we look out for more coverage than we typically have as we look out for the rest of the year. And M&CS, the story there is we keep getting orders that are outpacing the amount of revenue that we're able to deliver. And I think it's going to take us about 2 years to catch up on the demand that we have today and the balance between supply chain. Yes. Great question. Great question, Nate. This is something that our teams have been very focused on. And since we saw inflation start to rise last year, we've implemented numerous price increases. In some cases, we had to work through existing backlog before the new prices took effect. And so we saw a big step up from Q4 to Q1 in our price realization. And as we look forward throughout the year, we would expect that to continue to ramp in each successive quarter. . As we look at Q1, we -- our price did cover material inflation and freight. But you're right, we were still underwater. We didn't cover sort of our labor inflation, our overhead inflation. As we look out to Q2, we expect that to be neutral. And then in the second half of the year, price should outpace the inflation effects.  And I think it is important to note in our guide, we did increase it for stronger price realization based on what we experienced in Q1 and what our outlook is for the next quarter. And we also did up our inflation outlook. That's our expectation. That's our expectation for the full year. Yes. Yes. I think when we looked at adjusting our revenue guide and our forecast, the primary reason that we adjusted it is for a stronger price realization, and we're seeing that in AWS more than any other segment. As we look out for the rest of the year, we're still monitoring chip supply for the other segments. And water infrastructure has a high concentration in China. When we saw the impacts in Q1 from China, they were largely concentrated in water infrastructure, and that's also where we'll see the impact in Q2. It's really four things. You touched on the first thing. The first thing is price cost, and that will continue to improve throughout the year. The second thing is chip supply and M&CS as that revenue ramps in the second half, it has very good contribution margins. The third point, I would say is China. We have a very modest we have revenue declines in the first half in China. We're expecting to see a good pop in the back half in China. And then we announced today some leadership changes. We're pursuing some simplification opportunities and some of those will drive cost savings in the back half of the year as well. Yes. What we saw from a free cash flow perspective in Q1 is very much in line with our historical patterns. We typically use cash in the first quarter. As we work through the rest of the year, one of the things you may note is that our inventory balance is up. That was purposeful. We've taken on some incremental inventory to try to mitigate some of the impacts of the supply chain challenges. And we're going to be thoughtful as we try to work that down in the back half of the year. . Yes. I think just to give you some context, Scott, in Q4, we had about 200 basis points impacts from our price increases. That doubled to 400 basis points in Q1, and we would expect that to continue to increase. Now since the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, we've seen some of our commodities increase, our costs, particularly around stainless steel, which is impacted by nickel.  And so as we roll forward inflation assumptions for the next 3 quarters, we see more headwinds in the neighborhood of $40 million to $50 million. And so in response to that, our teams have gone out and implemented incremental price actions, some that they were not contemplated when we put together our budget. And so our teams are acting quickly. We've changed some of the practices around price increases. We used to have over a 60-day lag time between when we announced a price increase and when it went into effect. And now we're down to less than 2 weeks across our businesses. The other thing I would add, Scott, is the impact on our margins is price/cost has gotten a lot of attention. The secondary impact is mixed. When you look at our revenue mix, with M&CS being down this year, the revenue that we've lost because of the chip supply constraints comes with high margins. Yes.

            "name": "Patrick Decker",
            "content": "Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. The team came into 2022 with strong momentum, and they've taken full advantage of robust underlying demand around the world to deliver our first quarter operational results above expectations.  Revenues grew 4% organically, surpassing our guidance. Despite ongoing chip shortages constraining our utilities business, supply is slowly improving, which is reflected in quarter sequential revenue growth and EBITDA margin expansion in our metrology business.  Revenue strength was also broad-based globally. We saw healthy growth in every region, excluding China, given the COVID impact there. Western Europe was a standout, delivering 10% growth in the quarter.  But the robust global demand for our offering comes through most clearly in the pace of order intake. Orders were up 14% for the quarter, with record order bookings in every segment. M&CS at the fastest pace with a 25% order surge, as the value proposition of digital technologies continues to fuel demand.  Orders performance across the portfolio pushed our already healthy backlogs to 50% growth year-on-year. EBITDA margin performance was also above our previous guidance due to strong price realization, which mitigated much of the inflationary pressure, while at the same time, we continue to drive productivity and further simplification throughout the business. As a result of that good work from the team, we delivered EPS of $0.47, again, above our expectations.  The quarter did present some fresh challenges. China's ongoing response to COVID is having significant impact on our business, and it will have flow-on effects for some time in the global supply chain. And while our European business delivered exceptional revenue growth, the euro rate began to move unfavorably.  So conditions are dynamic. But the quarter's operational results show that the team is doing an excellent job, navigating the challenges and managing what it can control on a global basis.  Looking ahead, we're in a very strong position. as structural demand continues to be robust in all end markets and regions. And we have market leadership in the categories where demand is greatest, especially in digitally-enabled solutions. So we are raising our guidance for the year, and are on track to deliver the longer-term growth and strategic milestones we laid out at our Investor Day last fall.  Before turning over to Sandy for performance detail by segment, I want to mention how proud I am with the Xylem team and of our partners for their response to the war in Ukraine. When the war broke out, the Xylem team stepped up right away to provide for the safety and well-being of all of our Ukrainian colleagues and their families. Similarly, our team has shown extraordinary support by raising money for the humanitarian relief work of our NGO partners, whose activities include providing essential water and sanitation services both in Ukraine and the refugees. It's become one of our most successful mass giving campaigns ever, and I could not be prouder of the team.  Now I'll hand over to Sandy to review the quarter's results by segment. Thanks, Sandy. We'll turn to detailed guidance in a moment, but as I mentioned, we are increasing our revenue outlook due to continued strong demand and higher price realization. We're also raising the bottom end of our EPS guidance by $0.05, despite increasing foreign exchange headwinds.  The team is demonstrating that we are able to use our market leadership to drive price while holding and in many cases, even gaining share as reflected in the level of our order growth trends and expanding backlogs.  In fact, I want to give a big shout out to the team, including our channel and distribution partners for doing such a great job making sure our pricing moderated the effects of inflation. We also continue to foresee chip supply playing out much as we anticipated. We've had improved supply this quarter, and we expect that trend to continue in each successive quarter through the year.  Supply of chips remains well below our current needs and is expected to remain that way through at least early 2023. Yet, our team, along with our most critical suppliers and our customers continue to navigate the challenge and maintain current backlog while still winning new business.  With our ability to capture price on surging demand and with progressive order to revenue conversion, we're confident in lifting our full year guidance. Inflation will continue to be a significant factor, of course, so we will keep driving further price realization as appropriate.  In just a moment, you'll see we've significantly modified our euro exchange assumptions, and that will have a moderating impact on our reported EPS, but we expect the team will be able to cover the majority of those headwinds operationally. Sandy will give more color on that at a segment level in a few minutes. But the overall picture is more positive than we previously anticipated for the year, and puts us squarely on track to deliver our longer-term growth and strategic milestones.  When we laid out those milestones, we also detail the strategic pillars that would enable us to deliver them. They included making it easier for customers to do business with us, making it easier for our colleagues to serve them and continuing to reduce business complexity. So today, alongside our quarterly results, we've announced that we are further unifying and simplifying our segment and regional leadership.  Since the acquisitions that created our M&CS segment, we maintained a separate commercial interface to utility customers. This was necessary for some time to create a strong and focused new offering from Xylem, which has proven successful in achieving record deal wins and backlog.  Now we believe we have the opportunity to move to the next phase of our journey and building a single platform, one that leverages the market-leading breadth of our portfolio and makes it easier for customers to access it. We've previously done that across the rest of the world, except North America. So today, we announced that we are moving to 1 interface for our customers across the Americas as well.  We are integrating and unifying the leadership of the Americas commercial team. They will report to Matthew Pine, who will also now assume leadership of both the AWS and M&CS segments.  In Europe, Hayati Arcadis continues to lead commercial operations as well as the Water Infrastructure segment and will now lead the build-out of Xylem services offering globally. And Fran Sabinco will continue to lead commercial operations across the emerging markets.  As a result of the changes we've announced today, Colin Sable will leave Xylem after a transition period during which he will focus on a smooth leadership handover and provide advisory support to me and the leadership team. Most of you know, Colin. And so you know he has been a stalwart contributor to Xylem's growth story since the beginning. In his 16 years with the company, both with Xylem and our predecessor, ITT, his insight has been at the center of our strategic vision. His leadership has contributed to our emergence as a market leader in digital technologies as our M&CS orders growth shows, and I am profoundly grateful to have benefited from his considerable talent and unwavering commitment. We will miss him at the leadership table and our colleagues will miss him as a leader.  Turning to sustainability. Our growth framework emphasizes the creation of both economic and social value. Our performance on social value creation is highlighted in our annual sustainability report, which we'll publish later this month.  I won't steal too much of his thunder, but I am happy to share that Xylem is well ahead of schedule and reducing carbon emissions. Since 2019, we reduced our greenhouse gas intensity by 12%, across Scope 1 and 2 emissions. We've also driven our own water use down by more than 20% and doubled our rate of water recycling versus just 3 years ago.  The rigor and transparency of our reporting reflect our commitment to accountability as a sustainability leader. So I invite you to dig into the report when it comes out because sustainability is so fundamental to our strategic differentiation to our investment thesis and to our growth.  Now I'll turn it back over to Sandy for more color on our outlook and guide. Thanks, Sandy. We came into 2022 in a strong and enviable position, even in the face of headwinds from chip supply and inflation. Our performance in the first quarter has shown the team's ability to capitalize on our market leadership and deliver with discipline despite the various challenges around the world.  Demand has never been greater, we have strong commercial momentum, and we have a powerful balance sheet giving us strategic flexibility. And we have a great team showing resilience, agility and experience in managing the dynamics of a truly global business.  While our customers are as local as water is, the biggest water challenges are global, and the water sector is increasingly well networked internationally. Still, Xylem is one of only a small handful of global water players. That puts us in a strong position to play a leadership role in support of both the sector and our mission to solve water. So as you likely saw in our March announcement, we made the decision to move Xylem's headquarters to Washington, D.C., which is one of the main crossroads of the global water sector. Washington is not just the seat of U.S. water policy. It's where water thought leaders from all over the world convene, including the private sector, governments from around the world, multilaterals, academia and civil society.  We've also taken the opportunity of the move to reimagine our footprint for more flexible ways of working and simplifying and leaning our headquarters. The new location is on Water Street. Yes, it's on Water Street, right on the Anacostia River. We'll be officially opening the space in mid-June, and I look forward to welcoming all of you when you visit D.C.  Before turning to your questions, I have one more special note of thanks. This is Matt Latino's last quarterly earnings call at the helm of Investor Relations. We previously announced that Matt is taking a new role in Xylem, and it's an exciting new chapter for him. I know from comments so many of you have made over the years that you deeply value Matt's energy, accessibility and professionalism, and I benefited from his insightful counsel and his persistent positive encouragement through every kind of circumstance. So thank you, Matt.  Some of you have already met Andrea Vanderberg, who's taking the reins as our Investor Relations leader. Andrea has had great impact as the Head of Financial Planning and Analysis for Xylem. So she brings distinctively deep knowledge of the business to her leadership of IR. I'm confident you'll really enjoy getting to know Andrea and will find great value in working with her and from her insights and perspectives.  Now operator, I'll turn the call over to you for questions. Sure, Deane. I'll start with the latter half of your question, then I'll have Sandy speak to the margin profile in more detail. You're right. I mean, we've -- I think the team has done a great job working both with the suppliers of chips, but also with our customers on hanging on to deals and backlog. So we've had no losses of deals here in terms of cancellations. Also, what we're seeing is really good traction in terms of momentum, especially around midsized utilities as we're seeing greater adoption there as well, which is really encouraging. And so it smooths out kind of what our demand is going to be over time. . What we would say on the chip supply, as we said in our comments, is that we've seen a gradual recovery. And so we're not changing our outlook for the full year. It's just more confident in terms of what we're seeing there. So really encouraging.  Sandy, do you want to speak more to the margin profile? Not out of the woods yet, Deane. I mean, obviously, still risk there, but we think we've got that embedded in our guide for the full year. Sure, Deane. Yes, so our revenue exposure is roughly $350 million, about 7% of our total revenue. The impact in the first quarter was about $20 million in revenue. Our guide implies another $20 million in Q2. So first half of the year right now will be down about 20% in revenue. Second half, we expect to be up about 20% because we saw some of the impacts of lockdown even in the fourth quarter, still lingering in China.  We've got 4 factories in China. As you said, we got our headquarters in Shanghai. Three of those factories were closed for a few weeks. Later, they opened up at 50% capacity. All 4 of our sites right now are 100% at utilization. Our Nanjing plant, which is the one that supports our Applied Water business, it actually never closed. And that's the reason why AWS actually had mid-single-digit growth in China here in the first quarter.  So we expect there to be a gradual opening in China. We think it's all manageable within our guide. Obviously, there's a risk there. But our people are all safe and sound and they're working their backsides off to make sure we deliver on our commitments.  We did talk about also that there is the global supply chain effect. And we think that's the one that really is kind of the wild card going into the second half of the year, but we feel that we've got that embedded in our guide. I think the -- it's a great question, Mike. I think from a demand standpoint, we don't see many storm clouds on the horizon here right now, just where we are in the overall investment cycle. I know some may have questions even around what's happening in Europe from a geopolitical standpoint and focus on moving towards oil and gas alternatives, et cetera, will money be derailed or directed there. That's not even the way that the funding mechanisms work in Europe from a water utility standpoint. So we think even that's pretty robust at this point in time. . I think the -- I think in the near term, the challenges remain, in our case, chip supply and just being able to continue to execute what we have in our pipeline. Our bidding pipeline remains very healthy, north of almost $2.5 billion in the bidding pipeline at this point in time. So again, I'm paid to be paranoid. So we're looking at any storm clout there that we could possibly see. But it feels pretty healthy right now. And Mike, I would just -- I would offer up, I think to your question around visibility from an overall market sentiment standpoint, our bidding pipeline, especially in the treatment and on the wastewater side being treatment and even on the clean water side being metrology, we've got visibility there and a bidding pipeline of at least 2 to 3 years out. And that's why we're speaking with the level of confidence around what the overall market sentiment is. Sure. Yes. So we still feel really good, Mike, about the pipeline in terms of opportunities, and they range from larger opportunities of moves into various end markets. But even in the small- to medium-sized opportunities that are there. We've got some things here that we're pretty excited about in the near term that hopefully, we'll be able to execute on. So more to say there over the coming quarter or 2. But in general sense, we -- I feel -- certainly, we feel the M&A pipeline is as healthy as it's ever been. But we're -- we continue to be disciplined on valuation. Sure. Yes. So again, we come into the year with a really strong balance sheet. Sandy laid out what our firepower is at this point in time, and we are not hesitant to do deals. Obviously, we're going to be disciplined around valuation. I would not preclude equity from being used in the right situation, but it's not our first lever to really lean in on around capital deployment in general.  We also don't see M&A and any repurchase of shares being at odds with each other. In the past, we've used share repurchase authorization that we have out there right now to offset dilution of our long-term incentive grants. But we realize now there are time to be opportunistic given the current environment. And again, we think we're able to be both opportunistic on share repurchase as well as still do strategic M&A. These are not binary decisions, in our case. Sure. Great question. So let me parse it apart a bit. In terms of kind of existing contracts and deals, we've seen no cancellations there. Our customers are very well aware of the challenges. In many cases, they've got multisource, and so they're seeing the same thing from our competitors along the way. So they realized that we're not alone here.  But -- secondly, it's the fact that so much work has gone into getting the regulatory approval of these large AMI deployments. The returns on investment for them are so substantial in terms of revenue generation that they just want to continue to move forward and execute these things. And so the likelihood of them going back is minimized in that context.  Are they frustrated? Of course, we all are. But we've been weathering this for a while now, and we've been working closely with them to find alternatives to meet their needs, even though it may not be the level of metrology they originally spec, it's good enough right now to move forward, but still with a clear view of what the original approved implementation is going to look like.  In terms of new deals, yes, this is not just with existing customers. We're winning a number of new customers along the way, especially in that medium-sized part of the utility sector, which is really encouraging for us. In terms of changing our own behavior, we are -- we've been very disciplined along the way on being very open and forthright on what delivery frictions are right now so that we are not overpromising and underdelivering to any new deals that we're winning. We're being very clear about that. And I think customers appreciate that transparency as I'm sure our competitors are being transparent as well with them on what their own delivery lead times are. Sure, Nate. Again, good question. You're right. We have been very focused on the large utilities initially because, in many cases, as you will know from the conferences that you attend. Oftentimes, the medium to smaller utilities are looking to some of the larger ones that will lead in terms of proven technology, et cetera, but not always. I mean they've got their own minds and their own investment plans. . Oftentimes, for those medium utilities, they're looking at entire implementations of AMI as opposed to maybe for a larger metro area, it could be sections of a city. So when they make the decision to go full scale, it takes them a little bit longer to make that decision because it's a bigger strategic choice for them to make. And so it is encouraging to see that level of adoption happening.  They also -- their timing typically is tied more to the retirement of the existing metrology deployment that they have within their cities or communities. And so we see this as being a really healthy, steady stream of conversion over time because while they may study AMI for a while, getting ready for a complete upgrade or overhaul. These things are phased out over time. It's not going to happen all within a few years. It's going to be staged out over a decade or more, at least across the course of the U.S. Nathan, sorry, just really quickly, I mean, just another data point for you. I know you're aware of this and maybe others are not. I mean, again, when you think about the U.S. alone, we're talking about more than 50,000 water utilities, and the largest majority of those are small to medium size. So that's why we're so excited about this part of the market. And still less than half of that market has adopted AMI. Sure. Yes. So we've not seen any -- there's been no double ordering in that regard. I mean, the team is very disciplined around that. And the nice thing about these large metrology implementations is we know exactly what the endpoint count is that they need. And so we work very closely with our customers there to make sure that we're not taking duplicate orders.  We are prioritizing customers. We have someone allocation. Obviously, we're trying to prioritize those that are most stressed at this point in time. You never say never on these things in terms of at some point in time, somebody canceling. But I think, again, as I mentioned earlier, the customers understand that there are a few other alternatives and these implementations have gone through such a rigorous long-range regulatory approvals, and they're so critical to their own revenue generation capability that as long as we're able to meet their kind of basic demand as best we can and give them as full transparency as possible, we've been very proud and very pleased in working with them as well as with our chip suppliers. We talk a lot about the customers.  We are working as closely as possible with our suppliers to redesign a number of our chip requirements for next generation. We're redesigning our own products to meet minimum needs here in the immediate term. There's -- it's a multifaceted angle here, and that's why I'm so proud of the effort of the team to navigate this, including our customers' patients. And on the infrastructure bill, no real meaningful change there. I mean we do think it's going to be a positive over time. I don't really see that being a big impact here in '22 as things continue to settle out. We see that more as a benefit in '23 and beyond. And I would just offer up, Scott, that again, I think what we've been really pleased with is the resilience of our volume and our share. And in some cases, even gaining share in certain parts of the business. And so we -- the market really has shown a level of resilience in this area. And I think, again, we've been acting as a leader in this area. And pleased and as things continue to move from an inflationary standpoint, we'll continue to act responsibly. . And I think, Scott, the -- I mean, just some other -- trying to parse out your question here. I mean if you think about the incrementals in this business, I mean any dollar of growth that we get in this business is going to drop very healthy incrementals to the bottom line between the 30%, 40% range. In terms of what we've laid out in our long-term guide is in that mid-single-digit range, which, obviously, really drives heavy margin expansion, especially given the mix with M&CS. So maybe that helps frame out a little bit. But I mean, this is a business that generates very healthy incrementals at whatever level of growth there is. It's an interesting angle. It's not really one that we're prioritizing right now. I mean the things that we have in the pipeline, again, we really focus on the strategic logic behind them in terms of for the long run. We kind of look through this cycle in terms of chip demand. I understand where you're coming from with the question. But I wouldn't say that, that's really heightened our view on any particular asset based upon chip distress. Not as we see it. Based upon our experience in Europe over many years, Europe is very resilient when it comes to underlying demand. So it's a much heavier OpEx element there in terms of repair replacement of installed infrastructure. It's less reliant on new CapEx. And even when there is new CapEx, the funding mechanisms tend to be pretty well sheltered, at least, in the larger economies across Europe. I'm not saying there are no economies that are not immune to it, but we've really never seen big swings there on the CapEx side.  In terms of what we do see is the lion's share of our business there is repair and replacement, which is very stable, very steady as well as really attractive margins. And so we feel pretty confident right now around the outlook for Europe as we see it today. Joe, it's something that our teams stay close to every day. That's one of the biggest challenges, obviously, in this kind of inflationary environment is where is that limit. And we're always looking at win-loss ratios. We leverage our capabilities in sales force and our bidding pipeline there to get a feel for what that trade-off is. And so the team stays very close to that. And we look at that on a regular basis. And so until we see meaningful moves in that win-loss ratio, that tells us that we need to continue to make sure we cover the inflationary impacts.  What we're encouraged by thus far is that in the areas where we've taken price increases, we continue to see volume growth in those businesses. And so that's a good healthy indicator as well. But it's not something by any means, Joe, that we take for granted, something we're very, very close to. Sure. Yes. I mean, yes, you can imagine all management teams spend a lot of time thinking about when you make a change in guidance and how you want to approach that. We just felt that it was prudent at this point in time and confident to raise the lower end. Trimming the top end, we still see a path there. And obviously, things have to go in the right direction. But -- and obviously, there are clouds on the horizon that every company is seeing right now, but we see a path there, and we'll continue to monitor that. . In terms of what those are, it's what we've talked about before. We need to continue to see pricing momentum. We need to continue to see improvements in the chip supply and delivery around those areas. And hopefully, we'll see some improvement on the outlook for China. China is not a demand issue for us. It's really a matter of when we're able to ship out our backlog there as well as mitigate what the downstream impacts on the supply chain are. Well, thank you all again for your time and attention this morning and for your support, and I look forward to catching up with you between now and the next earnings call. In the meantime, stay safe, stay well, and I wish you all the very best. Thank you."

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Andrea van der Berg, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nAndrea van der Berg: Thank you, Operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Xylem's fourth quarter 2023 earnings conference. With me today are Chief Executive Officer, Matthew Pine; and Chief Financial Officer, Bill Grogan. They will provide their perspectives on Xylem's fourth quarter and full-year 2023 results, and discuss our outlook and guidance for 2024. Following our prepared remarks, we will address questions related to the information covered on the call. I'll ask that you please keep to one question and a follow-up, and then return to the queue. As a reminder, this call and our webcast are accompanied by a slide presentation available in the Investor section of our website. A replay of today's call will be available until midnight, February 13. Additionally, the call will be available for playback via the Investor section of our website under the heading Investor Events. Please turn to slide two. We will make some forward-looking statements in today's call, including references to future events or developments that we anticipate will or may occur in the future. These statements are subject to future risks and uncertainties, such as those factors described in Xylem's most recent annual report on Form 10-K and in subsequent reports filed with SEC. Please note that the company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements publicly to reflect subsequent events or circumstances, and actual events or results could differ materially from those anticipated. Please turn to slide three. We have provided you with a summary of our key performance metrics, including both GAAP and non-GAAP metrics. For purposes of today's call, all references will be on an organic and or adjusted basis unless otherwise indicated, and non-GAAP financials have been reconciled for you and are included in the appendix section of the presentation.  Now, please turn to slide four, and I'll turn the call over to our CEO, Matthew Pine.\nMatthew Pine: Thanks, Andrea. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. It's a pleasure to share the Xylem team's exceptional performance in the fourth quarter of a transformational year for the enterprise. The team delivered both Q4 and full-year results exceeding expectations on revenue and earnings per share. Looking at the fourth quarter, strong demand drove organic revenue growth of 9%. With disciplined execution, delivering EBITDA margin expansion of 90 basis points that drove double-digit orders growth. And our backlog is now more than $5 billion. Our Q4 performance capped off a year in which the team over-delivered in every quarter. Full-year organic revenues were up 12%, with EBITDA margin expansion of 190 basis points, and adjusted earnings per share growth of 20%. The team even delivered an Evoqua run-rate cost synergies in 2023, ahead of plan. Both the quarter and the full-year give us very strong momentum entering 2024. Despite a dynamic environment and the excitement of our combination with Evoqua, the team stayed focused on serving our customers. Joining forces with Evoqua has put the sector's most advanced portfolio of capabilities in the hands of our customers, and open up new opportunities to address even more of their water challenges. In our last earnings call, we shared a bit about the synergy traction we're seeing between the legacy Evoqua Services business and Xylem's dewatering business. And since them, we've seen the momentum continue to build as the team wins in the marketplace with our combined offering. On January 1, we made it even easier for our customers to access the full breadth of our capabilities with the creation of the Water Solutions and Services segment, effectively combining Xylem and Evoqua services offerings in a realigned segment structure. The move supports the continuing growth of our services business and expansion of recurring revenues. And it puts Xylem in an even stronger position to capture value by serving industrial water customers who are increasingly outsourcing water management as water stresses intensify. Looking forward, we are starting strong in 2024 with momentum from our outperformance in '23 and continued healthy demand in our major end-markets, though we're keeping a close eye on demand dynamics in China, and are taking a prudent view of end-markets for Applied Water, which is our most cyclical segment. Our backlog across the business is a source of continuing strength, especially at M&CS. We also feel very confident in our ability to drive continuing margin expansion by focusing our energy on the parts of the business delivering the greatest value. Overall, we're well-positioned for profitable and sustainable growth. We expect 2024 organic revenues to be up 3% to 5%, with solid EBITDA margin expansion, resulting in earnings per share between $4.00 and $4.20. I'll now turn it over to Bill to walk through the quarter's results and our outlook for 2024 in more detail.\nBill Grogan: Thanks, Matthew. Please turn to slide five. As Matthew mentioned, we are pleased with the strong finish to 2023. The team has stayed focused and consistently delivered throughout the year, exceeding on our expectations on revenue and earnings per share for Q4 and the full-year. We continue to see resilient demand and are supported by our $5.1 billion backlog, which grew 5% organically for the year. Organic orders grew 10% in the quarter, with book-to-bill approximately 1 for the quarter, and greater than 1 for the full-year. Total revenues grew 41%, while organic revenues rose 9%, exceeding our guidance of 4% to 5%. Outperformance was led by M&CS and Water Infrastructure. All regions grew led by double-digit growth in the U.S. EBITDA margin was 19.6%, up 90 basis points from the prior year, with productivity savings, price, and higher volume more than offsetting inflation. This reflects 33% incremental on the legacy Xylem performance. We finished the year with EBITDA margin of 18.9%, up nearly 200 basis points over prior year. Our EPS in the quarter was $0.99, above the high end of our guide by $0.03. When excluding the impacts of Evoqua, EPS was $1.10, up 10% over prior year. Our financial position remains robust with over $1 billion in cash, and available liquidity of approximately $2 billion. We ended the year with adjusted free cash flow conversion of 122%, exceeding our expectations and significantly improved versus last year. Please turn to slide six. Before I highlight each segment's fourth quarter performance, I want to touch on some changes you'll see in our earnings materials going forward. In the spirit of 80/20, we have simplified our earnings materials to focus on what is most important for investors. To assist with the transition this quarter, we have provided our historical presentation format in the Appendix. And now, on to the segment performance, measurement and Control Solutions saw robust orders growth of 14%, with strength across the portfolio led by metrology and assessment services. Backlog is $2.3 billion and book-to-bill is above 1, a reflection of the strong demand for our AMI solutions and other digital offerings. MCS revenue is up 21% driven by metrology backlog execution and strong demand. We finished the quarter with improved EBITDA margins of 17.3%, up 220 basis points versus the prior year, and up 160 basis points sequentially on productivity, price, and higher volumes. Water Infrastructure also saw orders growth of 9% for the quarter, with strength across the portfolio, led by robust treatment demand globally. Revenue exceeded our expectations with total growth of 30% on organic growth of 9%, driven by robust OpEx demand across all regions. EBITDA margin for the segment was down 90 basis points driven by the impacts of legacy Evoqua. When excluding the impact of Evoqua, EBITDA margin was up 50 basis points primarily due to price, productivity, and volume more than offsetting inflation and unfavorable mix. In Applied Water, although orders grew, book-to-bill was 0.9 times as we continue to work down our backlog and we saw softer demand environment in the U.S., our largest geography. Revenues were flat, in line with our guide, with the decline developed markets offset slightly by growth in emerging markets. Segment EBITDA margin expanded 80 basis points, with productivity and price more than offsetting inflation and volume declines. Integrated Solutions and Services, orders grew 5% on a pro forma basis, and book-to-bill was 1. Demand was driven by services. Pro forma revenue growth of 10% exceeded our expectations, as implied in our reported guidance, with healthy growth across the portfolio. Adjusted EBITDA margin was strong, at 21.1%, driven by price realization and volume. Please turn to slide seven, I will cover our segment outlook for the year. As Matthew mentioned, in December, we announced the creation of Water Solutions and Services segment. We are providing organic revenue guidance based on our previous reporting segments. Later this month, we will provide recast financial information aligned to the new segments. However, we expect the segment guidance outlook to largely be in line with the new segment structure, and will update as needed in our Q1 earnings call. In M&CS, we expected growth of low teens. Demand and order momentum for our AMI solutions remain strong. We expect to see sequential revenue improvement throughout 2024 supported by our robust backlog. In Water Infrastructure, we expect growth of mid-single digits. We expect resilient OpEx demand due to mission critical nature of our applications, and a healthy CapEx demand. We are continuing to closely monitor its office in China, where the majority of our business is in the utility end-market. In Applied Water, we expect a modest decline of low single digits. We continue to see pockets of softness across our end-markets, particularly in developed markets which make up about 80% of our business. We also expect to see headwinds as we lap price increases and our backlog returns to more historic levels. ISS growth is expected to be mid single digits with growth across both capital and services. We continue to see strong activity in our funnel, particularly in high-growth verticals such as food and beverage, energy, and life sciences. This segment is supported by $1 billion in backlog and a durable service business model. And as a reminder, the ISS growth outlook is on an organic basis. Now, let's turn to slide eight for our 2024 and Q1 guidance. The growth outlook by segment translates to 2024 full revenue of $8.4 billion to $8.5 billion, resulting in total revenue growth of 14% to 15%, organic revenue growth of 3% to 5%. EBITDA margin is expected to be 19.4% to 19.9%. This represents 50 to 100 basis points of expansion versus the prior year, driven by higher volume, productivity, and price offsetting inflation. This yields an EPS range of $4 to $4.20, up 8% at the midpoint over prior year. We are expecting approximately $100 million of exit run-rate cost synergies in 2024, which is embedded in our guide. Free cash flow conversion for the year is expected to be 115% of net income. Drilling down on the first quarter, we anticipate total revenue growth will be in the 36% to 38% range on a reported basis and 4% to 6% organically. We expect first quarter EBITDA margin to be approximately 18%, up 170 basis points, driven by higher volumes, continued price realization, and productivity gains. This yield first quarter EPS of $0.80 to $0.85. We are entering the year with momentum and from a position of strength. Our balanced outlook reflects our strong commercial position and the durability of our portfolio. While we also continue to monitor broader market conditions particularly in China in Applied Water which is our shortest cycle business. In the case of larger than expected volume declines, we are ready to take additional cost actions as needed to ensure continued focus on margin expansion. Overall, our expectations for the year remain positive as we build on a strong momentum. With that, please turn to slide nine. And, I'll turn the call back over to Matthew for closing comments.\nMatthew Pine: Thanks, Bill. It's been incredibly exciting to step up as CEO at a time of such great momentum and opportunity for Xylem. I began the year by spending time with customers and colleagues in India and the Middle East. Bill and I started off in India. And, the scale of ambition there to modernize infrastructure and tackle the big water challenges is frankly awe-inspiring. We have an outstanding team there doing great work to serve customers from our localized R&D in manufacturing platform that gives us a real competitive advantage. And both India and the Middle East provide great reminders of the fundamental interconnectedness of economic value and social value creation in our business. These markets present expansive commercial opportunity. And in both markets every project improves lives and increases sustainability of communities. We took some time out with colleagues in India to visit a school in a rural area outside of Bangalore. We got hands-on building a small scale water treatment system that now provides clean drinking water for the students and their community. I'll be honest. The experience of celebrating with those kids and their teachers as the clean water started to flow, well, it's just hard to describe. And you also know that the impact on educational outcomes, health, and quality of life is likely to be profound. That experience drove home for me not just the importance of what Xylem does but it reinforced the focus we are bringing into 2024. Whether it's a scale of a school or the scale of a megacity, we have to make it easier for customers and community to solve their big water challenges, reducing the complexity of water solutions that is our focus, simplifying water. We have assembled the most advanced and most comprehensive portfolio of products, solutions, and services in the sector. The value creation opportunity in front of us is to make all that capability far easier for customers to access to empower them to solve their most critical water challenges and deliver great outcomes with far less complexity. We started the year with great pace with strong execution off the back of a great Q4 in 2023 across both legacy Xylem and legacy Evoqua businesses. And our integration is well on track to deliver on the full value creation opportunity of the combination. Our end markets are resilient. And as long as the long-term trends in waters continue to intensify, our team is energized to take all of our capabilities to deliver even greater impact for our customers. Our investment thesis remains robust. And we continue to execute on the strategy that has positioned us so strongly for further economic and social value creation. We look forward to sharing further insights into our priorities and strategic direction at our upcoming Investor Day on May 30, in Washington, D.C., one I hope many of you will join us. Now, operator, I'll turn the call back over to you for questions.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nDeane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nMatthew Pine: Hey, good morning, Deane.\nDeane Dray: Matthew, as we start the year, I'd love to hear what's top-of-mind for you on your priorities? I know we're going to get lot more specifics at the Analysts' Day, but I think everyone would love to hear more about what you're thinking the past and the opportunity for margin improvement broadly, and just some really thoughts on optimizing the portfolio potentially?\nMatthew Pine: Great, thanks, Deane. First, I want to just acknowledge the team's Q4 and full-year performance during really a transformational year for Xylem. We had the Evoqua combination, we announced that in January, followed by the Idrica partnership. And then obviously we had a leadership change, all that while dealing with a lot of macro challenges out there around the globe. So, the team's done an incredible job staying focused. I'm really humbled and excited to lead Xylem into the next chapter. We've built, as I've said before, an incredible platform over the past decade. If you look back six or seven years ago, half the company did not even exist, so a lot of really good momentum there. And from my perspective, we're in a very unique position with our platform leadership of this 10-year journey, to have visibility across the water value chain. And this really enables us to provide holistic kind of optimized solutions to our customers. And moving forward, we're going to continue to build on that platform. As COO last year, I did lead the strategic planning process at Xylem. So, we have, I'd say, really strong strategic continuity as we transition this year. And I've talked about three strategic execution priorities that we're focused on. Number one, we have to deliver the Evoqua value capture, that's first and foremost. That's the transformational deal that we did last year. Number two, is -- and you hit on it, is we've got to get after margin expansion acceleration. And we're going to do that through productivity and continuing to drive operational excellence through the business. And then lastly, scaling our services business enabled by digital, which we'll talk probably later in the call about the WSS segment for 2024 and its ability to help us do that. One thing I'd mention that we don't talk a lot, it's kind of the soft side, and that's on culture. As we bring two large companies together, culture is really important. And we've put a lot of focus in that area. We call it high-impact culture. And there's behaviors to drive alignment around our culture. And those behaviors are, first of all, to have our people be inspired to innovate. We don't want people to feel a fear of failure. We want them to innovate, and that's going to drive the next cash flows and top line growth in the company. The second is we want them to be empowered to lead, and empowered in the business. And then thirdly, and most importantly, we want them to be accountable to deliver. And so, those are things we're really pushing the organization on get around that'll, I think, help us going forward. Maybe the last comment I would make is we have a call to action in the company that we've been working on over the past few months, and that's we want to simplify water. And what that means is really bridging our aspiration, which is Let's Solve Water, which everybody knows our tagline, to our strategic execution priorities, which is really the what we're going to focus on. So, that's really the rallying cry in the organization, and that's what we're going to be focused in 2024.\nDeane Dray: Appreciate all that color. And just as a follow-up for Bill, would love to get an update on the rollout of 80/20 besides the check-the-box, say, successful recast of the slides, which I really like. And then, could you also lead in on the update on the revenue synergy plans on Evoqua specifically? I know there is a plan to rollout existing North America customers who have asked to have similar facility outsourcing in Europe, so an update there, please?\nBill Grogan: Sure. So, maybe I'll start with the first part of the question. And first off, 80/20 is a multiyear journey. As it gets weaved into the fabric of the culture, Matthew just highlighted, we are on a cultural evolution incorporate some new tools and behaviors into the organization. And you have to remember, 80/20 is kind of about systematic complexity reduction, and that takes time. It's not just a quick math exercise, and you're done. It's really about focused resource allocation methodology, aligning the teams around the things that matter most in the business. Obviously, there's a tremendous margin opportunity that comes with the toolset, but longer term, it's really a tool to drive better organic growth performance by over-serving your best customers and innovating around your best ideas. We've kicked off two pilots late in Q4 within Applied Water North America and North American Metrology within M&CS. It takes some time to do the analytics. And I look to see some benefits starting to evolve within six to 12 months. Obviously, as we get to Investor Day, we'll be able to put some more specific numbers around that. But I really think it's going to be a transformational tool for the organization as we roll it out, and be a big part of our longer term margin improvement story.\nMatthew Pine: Yes. And maybe a little bit of color on revenue synergies, Deane. I am proud of the team. In Q4, we completed the APT integration to water infrastructure, which was a big deal. We've appointed regional synergy leads for the revenue capture around the globe, and incentives are in place to drive that execution. And one thing we've been really focused on is training our sales teams as well as our service teams. And as you know, in December, we announced the creation of the WSS segment for 2024, and a few comments there. Number one, we feel it's going to accelerate our synergies both on the cost side as well as the revenue side, which is where we're focused the most. One thing that maybe is not as intuitive, I do think it's going to help us with technician utilization, so we can leverage our technicians across the broader portfolio and also provide better career-pathing for them long-term, as well as leveraging technology. And then, the big thing it does for us, it really helps us leverage and enable the international expansion of WSS going forward in 2024, like I said, internationally. And then the most important thing, it makes it easier for our customers, because at the end of the day, it's about customer focus. And our customers, instead of picking up the phone to pick make four phone calls they can make one to Xylem to solve their biggest problems.\nOperator: The next question is from Mike Halloran with Baird. Please go ahead.\nMike Halloran: Yes, good morning everyone.\nMatthew Pine: Good morning, Mike.\nMike Halloran: So, a couple of questions here, first, you commented on confidence in the end markets and sustainability of existing trends. Maybe talk a little bit about utility in industrial markets. What the customers are saying at this point, willingness to put capital forward for CapEx-related projects, any signs of softness, acceleration? How are you thinking about things on that side?\nMatthew Pine: Yes, I could start this out. I mean, on the CapEx front, we've seen continued momentum there. For us, the proxy is our Treatment business. Orders were very strong both in Q4 and the full-year, up double-digits. And so, that gives us a lot of confidence. And that number is not only just in the U.S, that's a global number. So, every region is performing very well in treatment. So, from a CapEx perspective, we haven't seen any pullback or any concern there. And obviously, a big part of our focus in our portfolio in utilities is focused on the OpEx side, and that's about 75% of the revenue and that remains pretty strong. And it's also we've talked about buoyed, especially the long-term. It's not going to be this year or even in the next year, but over the next five to seven years, it's buoyed by regulation globally, whether that's in the U.S. with the Infrastructure Bill, which Includes PFAS funding or if you get into Europe with The Recovery and Resilience Act and then the AMP cycle in the U.K., that gives us a lot of confidence that we'll continue to see those markets do well. I'd say, industrially it's a little bit of a mixed bag on the new segment WSS, which is a Legacy ISS business, which contains assessment services and dewatering now. We're seeing strong momentum there, especially in power, life sciences, microelectronics, we're seeing a lot of bid activity there and we feel good about that. We've seen a little bit of lumpiness in the Applied Water end markets, especially resi. Some of that is just due to coming out of the pandemic where people were investing their discretionary income and upgrading their houses and also weather has played some of our role and that is a lot of our resi products are applied into Ag applications. And so, we've seen some lumpiness there in the U.S. and a little bit in Western Europe. So, that's a little bit of the view of the landscape.\nMike Halloran: Appreciate that. Second question, just on the pricing side of things, I guess twofold, one, how are you thinking about pricing for 2024? And as you think about the multiyear journey here as you're rolling out 80/20 and all the other toolkits you're going to be implementing, what is the opportunity for pricing as you think about the broader portfolio?\nMatthew Pine: Yes. Mike, maybe I'll take that one. So, price expectations for next year are going to ramp down versus the capture that we experienced in 2023, will be a little over a point. That's still significantly higher than pre-pandemic pricing, yes, but it is an opportunity as we look forward, as we calibrate and hone in the skills to continue to capture the value for our products across the portfolio. Obviously, that one point plus varies across the different segments with M&CS and WSS going forward, probably stronger price capture opportunities. And then, 80/20, I think will be up as we roll out opportunities within AWS as they've done some additional analytics and we look for just a better pricing methodology and capture on some of the longer tail customers that we have. Obviously, we're leveraging price as one of our components to offset inflation. The team does a really good job driving operational productivity as a second lever to offset inflation. So, we're going to manage price and material costs and stay positive. Obviously, that will compress a little bit next year as pricing goes down, but also our expectations relative to inflation will be price material cost positive and then look for productivity to really enhance our margins as we move forward.\nOperator: The next question is from Scott Davis with Melius Research. Please go ahead.\nScott Davis: Hey, good morning, everybody.\nMatthew Pine: Hey, good morning, Scott.\nScott Davis: Wanted to, you made some comments incrementally on China seemed a little bit more cautious, which is not a surprise just given what we've heard from others. But it looks like your business there has held up okay, at least versus some peers out there. But what maybe a little bit more granularity there would be helpful. Thanks.\nMatthew Pine: Yes. Thanks for the question, Scott. China for us now with a new combination of the company is about mid- single-digit in terms of our revenue. With over 50% of that being water infrastructure from an exposure standpoint, largely tied to public utilities, we've seen pretty decent orders there. Q4 orders were up 11%, full-year up 10%. On the revenue side, we were up on a full-year about 2% low single-digits. But if you look back on a two year stack, we're down mid-single-digits in China. So, the backlog is building, but we haven't seen that convert to revenue yet. Things continue to slide to the right in terms of funding. I think if you read the news, you continue to see the government's intervention in the economy there and that's taking some of the funds away from investing in some of the infrastructure. But we believe that's more of a short-term issue. Across the utilities exposure, we continue to see again a healthy pipeline and we'll continue to monitor that funding. I would say, on the industrial side, it's a little bit of a similar demand environment and that's held up a little bit more resilient, to be honest over utilities. And the last thing I would say with China, overall, we expect China to be roughly flat in 2024 for the business.\nScott Davis: Okay. That's super helpful. Your balance sheet is in fantastic shape and given the way you structured the Evoqua deal, just it leads me natural question would be, are there should we expect kind of some bolt-on acquisitions or anything kind of in 2024 that perhaps you could talk about your M&A backlog and just as much as talk about the pipeline, perhaps talk about your interest in doing deals?  That would be helpful.\nMatthew Pine: Thanks. It's a good question. We closed out 2023 very strong following the close of our largest transformational deal in our history. And so, one of the things we're laser focused on is making sure that we integrate Evoqua well and we get the value capture in the near-term. To your point, we do have a strong M&A pipeline, and the structure of the Evoqua deal allows us flexibility with a strong balance sheet. The short-term focus, Scott is going to be to focus on small to medium bolt-ons. Evoqua, we can fairly ring fence within the business, but there's other parts of the portfolio where we do want to continue to be inquisitive, with again with small to medium bolt-ons. And we'll continue our disciplined approach, and we're evaluating our longer term capital allocation framework, and we'll share more about that in Investor Day in May.\nOperator: The next question is from Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Please go ahead.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Hey, good morning, everyone.\nMatthew Pine: Good morning, Andy.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Matt or Bill, when you look at the 50 to 100 basis points of margin expansion for '24, could you give us a little more color on how that margin improvement translates by segment? And then you mentioned the 80/20 pilots with a focus on MCS. You did have nice improvement, margin improvement in MCS in Q4. So, how do you think about the margin potential in that particular business over the longer term?\nBill Grogan: Yes, I mean, relative to the largest impact in margin expansion for next year, I think M&CS leads the pack. Obviously, we've started our journey on margin improvement and recovery as they've gone through chip supply shortages, which I think for the most part has resolved. They've added capacity within the production facility to meet kind of the record backlog levels that they've had. They've gone out with incremental pricing to improve the quality of the margin within the backlog. And I think the value of their products and solutions, they're able to continue to drive incremental price as we go into next year. So, I think their ability to exit the year at near historic record levels of EBITDA margin is the target. As they continue to leverage their volume and drive some pretty significant productivity as they look at their labor and material footprint around their products. So, we're excited about the progress that they've made and look for them to continue to sequentially improve as we progress through the year in 2024.\nAndy Kaplowitz: That's very helpful. And Matt, maybe just a bigger picture question for you. I know you won a guy conservatively for this year, being prudent and applied in China, but you've got such a strong growth business in MCS, and you're still only got in 3% to 5%. Xylem had a longer term algorithm of 4% to 6%. So, as you take over the CEO range, do you worry at all that that's high or given all the self-help focus you know, focus on digitization, all these kinds of things, that that's still the right longer term growth rate?\nMatthew Pine: Yes, I think again, a lot of that is not changed from what we've said in the past. It's just, I think, being balanced in our approach and with a watchful eye to China. We've got that flat year-over-year, but there could be some potential headwinds there. And also with Applied Water, which is some of that cyclicality and timing as we think about that, Andy. So, from a long-term framework, none of that's changed. It's just really more thinking about in the context of 2024 and, thinking about going out with a balanced approach. We do have a lot of healthy demand across our largest end markets. When you look at the year from a seasonality standpoint, it's normalized. There's no change in terms of the seasonality of our business and how we ramp from Q1 through the balance of the year. I think the thing I'd leave you with too, is our margin guide reflects low 40s pro forma incrementals. And so, we feel really, really strong about the margin that we're delivering as well in the growth.\nOperator: The next question is from Nathan Jones with Stiefel. Please go ahead. The next question is from Nathan Jones with Stifel. Please go ahead. Mr. Jones, is your line open?\nNathan Jones: Good morning, everyone.\nMatthew Pine: Hey, good morning, Nathan.\nNathan Jones: I'm going to follow-up on the margin question. I think the vocal cost synergies get you something like 80 basis points. And you're obviously going to get some pretty good margin expansion out of the M&CS operating leverage, which when I do the math, it gets me well in excess of 100 basis points top end of your margin expansion target. So, can you talk about what could be the offset there or increased growth investments or anything that's kind of muting some of that margin expansion that I might otherwise expect?\nBill Grogan: Yes, I think the biggest piece probably in your high level math is we continue to invest in the business. Obviously, we've got significant growth opportunities over the long-term that we want to make sure that we're allocating resources around across all four segments. There's exciting things relative to product launches and market expansions that put a little bit of pressure on some of the significant accretion relative to productivity and the synergies that you highlighted. And then also, Nate, there's obviously a volatile macro environment that you want to make sure that we're more prudent relative to the guide that we have the ability to account for things that come up. So, I think our guide relative to the margin expansion is fairly balanced. I think and Matt you just highlighted at 40% incrementals on a pro forma basis, that's really strong flow through, so excited about the basis. That's really strong flow through. So, excited about the opportunities the team has laid out here as we look for a really strong year on our margin expansion journey. And I think longer term, obviously, we're just starting with the 80-20 implementation. That'll add some tailwind as we exit the year and into 2025 to try to get us at the higher end of that range longer term.\nNathan Jones: Great. And then, my follow-up, Bill, I think you just mentioned that the chip supply issue has basically worked itself out. Can you guys comment on where the past view backlog is in M&CS today and when you expect that to get to whatever a normal level of past view backlog is?\nMatthew Pine: Hey, Nate, I'll take it. It's Matthew. Yes, we're making good progress on the past view backlog. If you remember, we started 2023 around 30% past due. We exited at 20. And we feel that we're going to get through the bulk of the past due backlog in 2024. Some of that may stray into '25. But for the most part, we feel pretty confident that we'll get through the past due backlog in 2024 with, again, with a little bit of carryover into '25. And so, really from a bottleneck standpoint, it really just comes down to our customers' ability to go out and execute the deployments. Chip supply is flowing. We've made investments over the past few years in our capacity. So, there's no capacity limitations from our point of view internally here at Xylem in our four walls.\nOperator: The next question is from Joe Giordano with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nJoe Giordano: Hey, guys. Good morning.\nMatthew Pine: Hey, good morning, Joe.\nBill Grogan: Hey, Joe.\nJoe Giordano: I wanted to touch on Idrica. I guess one of the more like interesting kind of high level where can we go type stories within water, how to get a real connected utility. I'm just curious how you guys think about this. Like, how do we judge success? What how meaningful could something like this turn into, kind of over a near to medium term and just kind of maybe set expectations about where that can go?\nMatthew Pine: Yes, I mean, I've been pretty bullish on this. You've heard me talk about being the aggregator of data in the utilities, much like, folks are in the building management world or in the residential home. We believe we have the capabilities through this partnership to be able to be the leader in aggregating utility data. We're off to a really good start. We only had about six months under our belt last year once we got the combination closed. The teams have made great progress globally and we built a significant pipeline. And one of the things I've talked about is, it's one thing is to get the platform in play at the utility, but it's about building on the applications as well as pulling through our core products. So, a little bit of a land and expand is how I would frame it. Get the platform in place, help them optimize their water networks with our applications as well as pulling through our products like AMI, our treatment products, et cetera. So, we've had some significant wins. Some of those I've highlighted on prior calls. We continue to have wins and build momentum. Like I said, and it's not a specific region, it's across the world, whether that's in the U.K., Italy. We just won a big deal in the Middle East, which is for a new city with fully digitizing their water management system with this platform. And I've talked in the past about some of the deals in Spain and the U.S. we've done, in terms of putting the platform in and being able to sell AMI deals as well as treatment products. So, I think it can be a big opportunity for us. Obviously, we'll give you a lot more color as we as we get closer to May 30th at our Investor Day. But we're really bullish on the partnership.\nJoe Giordano: That's great color. And then, I just apologize if you mentioned some of this on the prepared remarks. I had to join late, but -- on Evoqua, like revenue side synergies, I know like selling an ISS solution outside the U.S. is going to take a long time to build out, but I'm curious if there's anything you could point to about like leveraging existing channels that you have and like Europe to put product through, which I would imagine would be a lower lift than to try to do a solution based on.\nMatthew Pine: Yes, that's kind of a shorter to medium term objective, and we've already had some wins. We just had one in South Africa, actually, where we took the capital from the legacy of local business through the legacies island business in South Africa. So, we were able to execute and deploy that capital into an industrial application without really having to have service, folks on the ground and infrastructure. So, those are things that we're focused on kind of in the short to medium term is leveraging the product side and really the capital side of the legacy of local business through those island channels, both in the U.S. as well as internationally. So, we are all starting to see progress there.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-session session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Matthew Pine for any closing remarks.\nMatthew Pine: Yes, I just want to thank everybody for joining our call today, and for your interest in Xylem. We look forward to speaking again in early May, followed by our Investor Day on May 30, where we're going to provide more details on our long-term outlook. Take care, and make it a great day.\nOperator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Bill Grogan",
            "content": "Thanks, Matthew. Please turn to slide five. As Matthew mentioned, we are pleased with the strong finish to 2023. The team has stayed focused and consistently delivered throughout the year, exceeding on our expectations on revenue and earnings per share for Q4 and the full-year. We continue to see resilient demand and are supported by our $5.1 billion backlog, which grew 5% organically for the year. Organic orders grew 10% in the quarter, with book-to-bill approximately 1 for the quarter, and greater than 1 for the full-year. Total revenues grew 41%, while organic revenues rose 9%, exceeding our guidance of 4% to 5%. Outperformance was led by M&CS and Water Infrastructure. All regions grew led by double-digit growth in the U.S. EBITDA margin was 19.6%, up 90 basis points from the prior year, with productivity savings, price, and higher volume more than offsetting inflation. This reflects 33% incremental on the legacy Xylem performance. We finished the year with EBITDA margin of 18.9%, up nearly 200 basis points over prior year. Our EPS in the quarter was $0.99, above the high end of our guide by $0.03. When excluding the impacts of Evoqua, EPS was $1.10, up 10% over prior year. Our financial position remains robust with over $1 billion in cash, and available liquidity of approximately $2 billion. We ended the year with adjusted free cash flow conversion of 122%, exceeding our expectations and significantly improved versus last year. Please turn to slide six. Before I highlight each segment's fourth quarter performance, I want to touch on some changes you'll see in our earnings materials going forward. In the spirit of 80/20, we have simplified our earnings materials to focus on what is most important for investors. To assist with the transition this quarter, we have provided our historical presentation format in the Appendix. And now, on to the segment performance, measurement and Control Solutions saw robust orders growth of 14%, with strength across the portfolio led by metrology and assessment services. Backlog is $2.3 billion and book-to-bill is above 1, a reflection of the strong demand for our AMI solutions and other digital offerings. MCS revenue is up 21% driven by metrology backlog execution and strong demand. We finished the quarter with improved EBITDA margins of 17.3%, up 220 basis points versus the prior year, and up 160 basis points sequentially on productivity, price, and higher volumes. Water Infrastructure also saw orders growth of 9% for the quarter, with strength across the portfolio, led by robust treatment demand globally. Revenue exceeded our expectations with total growth of 30% on organic growth of 9%, driven by robust OpEx demand across all regions. EBITDA margin for the segment was down 90 basis points driven by the impacts of legacy Evoqua. When excluding the impact of Evoqua, EBITDA margin was up 50 basis points primarily due to price, productivity, and volume more than offsetting inflation and unfavorable mix. In Applied Water, although orders grew, book-to-bill was 0.9 times as we continue to work down our backlog and we saw softer demand environment in the U.S., our largest geography. Revenues were flat, in line with our guide, with the decline developed markets offset slightly by growth in emerging markets. Segment EBITDA margin expanded 80 basis points, with productivity and price more than offsetting inflation and volume declines. Integrated Solutions and Services, orders grew 5% on a pro forma basis, and book-to-bill was 1. Demand was driven by services. Pro forma revenue growth of 10% exceeded our expectations, as implied in our reported guidance, with healthy growth across the portfolio. Adjusted EBITDA margin was strong, at 21.1%, driven by price realization and volume. Please turn to slide seven, I will cover our segment outlook for the year. As Matthew mentioned, in December, we announced the creation of Water Solutions and Services segment. We are providing organic revenue guidance based on our previous reporting segments. Later this month, we will provide recast financial information aligned to the new segments. However, we expect the segment guidance outlook to largely be in line with the new segment structure, and will update as needed in our Q1 earnings call. In M&CS, we expected growth of low teens. Demand and order momentum for our AMI solutions remain strong. We expect to see sequential revenue improvement throughout 2024 supported by our robust backlog. In Water Infrastructure, we expect growth of mid-single digits. We expect resilient OpEx demand due to mission critical nature of our applications, and a healthy CapEx demand. We are continuing to closely monitor its office in China, where the majority of our business is in the utility end-market. In Applied Water, we expect a modest decline of low single digits. We continue to see pockets of softness across our end-markets, particularly in developed markets which make up about 80% of our business. We also expect to see headwinds as we lap price increases and our backlog returns to more historic levels. ISS growth is expected to be mid single digits with growth across both capital and services. We continue to see strong activity in our funnel, particularly in high-growth verticals such as food and beverage, energy, and life sciences. This segment is supported by $1 billion in backlog and a durable service business model. And as a reminder, the ISS growth outlook is on an organic basis. Now, let's turn to slide eight for our 2024 and Q1 guidance. The growth outlook by segment translates to 2024 full revenue of $8.4 billion to $8.5 billion, resulting in total revenue growth of 14% to 15%, organic revenue growth of 3% to 5%. EBITDA margin is expected to be 19.4% to 19.9%. This represents 50 to 100 basis points of expansion versus the prior year, driven by higher volume, productivity, and price offsetting inflation. This yields an EPS range of $4 to $4.20, up 8% at the midpoint over prior year. We are expecting approximately $100 million of exit run-rate cost synergies in 2024, which is embedded in our guide. Free cash flow conversion for the year is expected to be 115% of net income. Drilling down on the first quarter, we anticipate total revenue growth will be in the 36% to 38% range on a reported basis and 4% to 6% organically. We expect first quarter EBITDA margin to be approximately 18%, up 170 basis points, driven by higher volumes, continued price realization, and productivity gains. This yield first quarter EPS of $0.80 to $0.85. We are entering the year with momentum and from a position of strength. Our balanced outlook reflects our strong commercial position and the durability of our portfolio. While we also continue to monitor broader market conditions particularly in China in Applied Water which is our shortest cycle business. In the case of larger than expected volume declines, we are ready to take additional cost actions as needed to ensure continued focus on margin expansion. Overall, our expectations for the year remain positive as we build on a strong momentum. With that, please turn to slide nine. And, I'll turn the call back over to Matthew for closing comments. Sure. So, maybe I'll start with the first part of the question. And first off, 80/20 is a multiyear journey. As it gets weaved into the fabric of the culture, Matthew just highlighted, we are on a cultural evolution incorporate some new tools and behaviors into the organization. And you have to remember, 80/20 is kind of about systematic complexity reduction, and that takes time. It's not just a quick math exercise, and you're done. It's really about focused resource allocation methodology, aligning the teams around the things that matter most in the business. Obviously, there's a tremendous margin opportunity that comes with the toolset, but longer term, it's really a tool to drive better organic growth performance by over-serving your best customers and innovating around your best ideas. We've kicked off two pilots late in Q4 within Applied Water North America and North American Metrology within M&CS. It takes some time to do the analytics. And I look to see some benefits starting to evolve within six to 12 months. Obviously, as we get to Investor Day, we'll be able to put some more specific numbers around that. But I really think it's going to be a transformational tool for the organization as we roll it out, and be a big part of our longer term margin improvement story. Yes, I mean, relative to the largest impact in margin expansion for next year, I think M&CS leads the pack. Obviously, we've started our journey on margin improvement and recovery as they've gone through chip supply shortages, which I think for the most part has resolved. They've added capacity within the production facility to meet kind of the record backlog levels that they've had. They've gone out with incremental pricing to improve the quality of the margin within the backlog. And I think the value of their products and solutions, they're able to continue to drive incremental price as we go into next year. So, I think their ability to exit the year at near historic record levels of EBITDA margin is the target. As they continue to leverage their volume and drive some pretty significant productivity as they look at their labor and material footprint around their products. So, we're excited about the progress that they've made and look for them to continue to sequentially improve as we progress through the year in 2024. Yes, I think the biggest piece probably in your high level math is we continue to invest in the business. Obviously, we've got significant growth opportunities over the long-term that we want to make sure that we're allocating resources around across all four segments. There's exciting things relative to product launches and market expansions that put a little bit of pressure on some of the significant accretion relative to productivity and the synergies that you highlighted. And then also, Nate, there's obviously a volatile macro environment that you want to make sure that we're more prudent relative to the guide that we have the ability to account for things that come up. So, I think our guide relative to the margin expansion is fairly balanced. I think and Matt you just highlighted at 40% incrementals on a pro forma basis, that's really strong flow through, so excited about the basis. That's really strong flow through. So, excited about the opportunities the team has laid out here as we look for a really strong year on our margin expansion journey. And I think longer term, obviously, we're just starting with the 80-20 implementation. That'll add some tailwind as we exit the year and into 2025 to try to get us at the higher end of that range longer term. Hey, Joe."

            "content": "Thanks, Andrea. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. It's a pleasure to share the Xylem team's exceptional performance in the fourth quarter of a transformational year for the enterprise. The team delivered both Q4 and full-year results exceeding expectations on revenue and earnings per share. Looking at the fourth quarter, strong demand drove organic revenue growth of 9%. With disciplined execution, delivering EBITDA margin expansion of 90 basis points that drove double-digit orders growth. And our backlog is now more than $5 billion. Our Q4 performance capped off a year in which the team over-delivered in every quarter. Full-year organic revenues were up 12%, with EBITDA margin expansion of 190 basis points, and adjusted earnings per share growth of 20%. The team even delivered an Evoqua run-rate cost synergies in 2023, ahead of plan. Both the quarter and the full-year give us very strong momentum entering 2024. Despite a dynamic environment and the excitement of our combination with Evoqua, the team stayed focused on serving our customers. Joining forces with Evoqua has put the sector's most advanced portfolio of capabilities in the hands of our customers, and open up new opportunities to address even more of their water challenges. In our last earnings call, we shared a bit about the synergy traction we're seeing between the legacy Evoqua Services business and Xylem's dewatering business. And since them, we've seen the momentum continue to build as the team wins in the marketplace with our combined offering. On January 1, we made it even easier for our customers to access the full breadth of our capabilities with the creation of the Water Solutions and Services segment, effectively combining Xylem and Evoqua services offerings in a realigned segment structure. The move supports the continuing growth of our services business and expansion of recurring revenues. And it puts Xylem in an even stronger position to capture value by serving industrial water customers who are increasingly outsourcing water management as water stresses intensify. Looking forward, we are starting strong in 2024 with momentum from our outperformance in '23 and continued healthy demand in our major end-markets, though we're keeping a close eye on demand dynamics in China, and are taking a prudent view of end-markets for Applied Water, which is our most cyclical segment. Our backlog across the business is a source of continuing strength, especially at M&CS. We also feel very confident in our ability to drive continuing margin expansion by focusing our energy on the parts of the business delivering the greatest value. Overall, we're well-positioned for profitable and sustainable growth. We expect 2024 organic revenues to be up 3% to 5%, with solid EBITDA margin expansion, resulting in earnings per share between $4.00 and $4.20. I'll now turn it over to Bill to walk through the quarter's results and our outlook for 2024 in more detail. Thanks, Bill. It's been incredibly exciting to step up as CEO at a time of such great momentum and opportunity for Xylem. I began the year by spending time with customers and colleagues in India and the Middle East. Bill and I started off in India. And, the scale of ambition there to modernize infrastructure and tackle the big water challenges is frankly awe-inspiring. We have an outstanding team there doing great work to serve customers from our localized R&D in manufacturing platform that gives us a real competitive advantage. And both India and the Middle East provide great reminders of the fundamental interconnectedness of economic value and social value creation in our business. These markets present expansive commercial opportunity. And in both markets every project improves lives and increases sustainability of communities. We took some time out with colleagues in India to visit a school in a rural area outside of Bangalore. We got hands-on building a small scale water treatment system that now provides clean drinking water for the students and their community. I'll be honest. The experience of celebrating with those kids and their teachers as the clean water started to flow, well, it's just hard to describe. And you also know that the impact on educational outcomes, health, and quality of life is likely to be profound. That experience drove home for me not just the importance of what Xylem does but it reinforced the focus we are bringing into 2024. Whether it's a scale of a school or the scale of a megacity, we have to make it easier for customers and community to solve their big water challenges, reducing the complexity of water solutions that is our focus, simplifying water. We have assembled the most advanced and most comprehensive portfolio of products, solutions, and services in the sector. The value creation opportunity in front of us is to make all that capability far easier for customers to access to empower them to solve their most critical water challenges and deliver great outcomes with far less complexity. We started the year with great pace with strong execution off the back of a great Q4 in 2023 across both legacy Xylem and legacy Evoqua businesses. And our integration is well on track to deliver on the full value creation opportunity of the combination. Our end markets are resilient. And as long as the long-term trends in waters continue to intensify, our team is energized to take all of our capabilities to deliver even greater impact for our customers. Our investment thesis remains robust. And we continue to execute on the strategy that has positioned us so strongly for further economic and social value creation. We look forward to sharing further insights into our priorities and strategic direction at our upcoming Investor Day on May 30, in Washington, D.C., one I hope many of you will join us. Now, operator, I'll turn the call back over to you for questions. Hey, good morning, Deane. Great, thanks, Deane. First, I want to just acknowledge the team's Q4 and full-year performance during really a transformational year for Xylem. We had the Evoqua combination, we announced that in January, followed by the Idrica partnership. And then obviously we had a leadership change, all that while dealing with a lot of macro challenges out there around the globe. So, the team's done an incredible job staying focused. I'm really humbled and excited to lead Xylem into the next chapter. We've built, as I've said before, an incredible platform over the past decade. If you look back six or seven years ago, half the company did not even exist, so a lot of really good momentum there. And from my perspective, we're in a very unique position with our platform leadership of this 10-year journey, to have visibility across the water value chain. And this really enables us to provide holistic kind of optimized solutions to our customers. And moving forward, we're going to continue to build on that platform. As COO last year, I did lead the strategic planning process at Xylem. So, we have, I'd say, really strong strategic continuity as we transition this year. And I've talked about three strategic execution priorities that we're focused on. Number one, we have to deliver the Evoqua value capture, that's first and foremost. That's the transformational deal that we did last year. Number two, is -- and you hit on it, is we've got to get after margin expansion acceleration. And we're going to do that through productivity and continuing to drive operational excellence through the business. And then lastly, scaling our services business enabled by digital, which we'll talk probably later in the call about the WSS segment for 2024 and its ability to help us do that. One thing I'd mention that we don't talk a lot, it's kind of the soft side, and that's on culture. As we bring two large companies together, culture is really important. And we've put a lot of focus in that area. We call it high-impact culture. And there's behaviors to drive alignment around our culture. And those behaviors are, first of all, to have our people be inspired to innovate. We don't want people to feel a fear of failure. We want them to innovate, and that's going to drive the next cash flows and top line growth in the company. The second is we want them to be empowered to lead, and empowered in the business. And then thirdly, and most importantly, we want them to be accountable to deliver. And so, those are things we're really pushing the organization on get around that'll, I think, help us going forward. Maybe the last comment I would make is we have a call to action in the company that we've been working on over the past few months, and that's we want to simplify water. And what that means is really bridging our aspiration, which is Let's Solve Water, which everybody knows our tagline, to our strategic execution priorities, which is really the what we're going to focus on. So, that's really the rallying cry in the organization, and that's what we're going to be focused in 2024. Yes. And maybe a little bit of color on revenue synergies, Deane. I am proud of the team. In Q4, we completed the APT integration to water infrastructure, which was a big deal. We've appointed regional synergy leads for the revenue capture around the globe, and incentives are in place to drive that execution. And one thing we've been really focused on is training our sales teams as well as our service teams. And as you know, in December, we announced the creation of the WSS segment for 2024, and a few comments there. Number one, we feel it's going to accelerate our synergies both on the cost side as well as the revenue side, which is where we're focused the most. One thing that maybe is not as intuitive, I do think it's going to help us with technician utilization, so we can leverage our technicians across the broader portfolio and also provide better career-pathing for them long-term, as well as leveraging technology. And then, the big thing it does for us, it really helps us leverage and enable the international expansion of WSS going forward in 2024, like I said, internationally. And then the most important thing, it makes it easier for our customers, because at the end of the day, it's about customer focus. And our customers, instead of picking up the phone to pick make four phone calls they can make one to Xylem to solve their biggest problems. Good morning, Mike. Yes, I could start this out. I mean, on the CapEx front, we've seen continued momentum there. For us, the proxy is our Treatment business. Orders were very strong both in Q4 and the full-year, up double-digits. And so, that gives us a lot of confidence. And that number is not only just in the U.S, that's a global number. So, every region is performing very well in treatment. So, from a CapEx perspective, we haven't seen any pullback or any concern there. And obviously, a big part of our focus in our portfolio in utilities is focused on the OpEx side, and that's about 75% of the revenue and that remains pretty strong. And it's also we've talked about buoyed, especially the long-term. It's not going to be this year or even in the next year, but over the next five to seven years, it's buoyed by regulation globally, whether that's in the U.S. with the Infrastructure Bill, which Includes PFAS funding or if you get into Europe with The Recovery and Resilience Act and then the AMP cycle in the U.K., that gives us a lot of confidence that we'll continue to see those markets do well. I'd say, industrially it's a little bit of a mixed bag on the new segment WSS, which is a Legacy ISS business, which contains assessment services and dewatering now. We're seeing strong momentum there, especially in power, life sciences, microelectronics, we're seeing a lot of bid activity there and we feel good about that. We've seen a little bit of lumpiness in the Applied Water end markets, especially resi. Some of that is just due to coming out of the pandemic where people were investing their discretionary income and upgrading their houses and also weather has played some of our role and that is a lot of our resi products are applied into Ag applications. And so, we've seen some lumpiness there in the U.S. and a little bit in Western Europe. So, that's a little bit of the view of the landscape. Yes. Mike, maybe I'll take that one. So, price expectations for next year are going to ramp down versus the capture that we experienced in 2023, will be a little over a point. That's still significantly higher than pre-pandemic pricing, yes, but it is an opportunity as we look forward, as we calibrate and hone in the skills to continue to capture the value for our products across the portfolio. Obviously, that one point plus varies across the different segments with M&CS and WSS going forward, probably stronger price capture opportunities. And then, 80/20, I think will be up as we roll out opportunities within AWS as they've done some additional analytics and we look for just a better pricing methodology and capture on some of the longer tail customers that we have. Obviously, we're leveraging price as one of our components to offset inflation. The team does a really good job driving operational productivity as a second lever to offset inflation. So, we're going to manage price and material costs and stay positive. Obviously, that will compress a little bit next year as pricing goes down, but also our expectations relative to inflation will be price material cost positive and then look for productivity to really enhance our margins as we move forward. Hey, good morning, Scott. Yes. Thanks for the question, Scott. China for us now with a new combination of the company is about mid- single-digit in terms of our revenue. With over 50% of that being water infrastructure from an exposure standpoint, largely tied to public utilities, we've seen pretty decent orders there. Q4 orders were up 11%, full-year up 10%. On the revenue side, we were up on a full-year about 2% low single-digits. But if you look back on a two year stack, we're down mid-single-digits in China. So, the backlog is building, but we haven't seen that convert to revenue yet. Things continue to slide to the right in terms of funding. I think if you read the news, you continue to see the government's intervention in the economy there and that's taking some of the funds away from investing in some of the infrastructure. But we believe that's more of a short-term issue. Across the utilities exposure, we continue to see again a healthy pipeline and we'll continue to monitor that funding. I would say, on the industrial side, it's a little bit of a similar demand environment and that's held up a little bit more resilient, to be honest over utilities. And the last thing I would say with China, overall, we expect China to be roughly flat in 2024 for the business. Thanks. It's a good question. We closed out 2023 very strong following the close of our largest transformational deal in our history. And so, one of the things we're laser focused on is making sure that we integrate Evoqua well and we get the value capture in the near-term. To your point, we do have a strong M&A pipeline, and the structure of the Evoqua deal allows us flexibility with a strong balance sheet. The short-term focus, Scott is going to be to focus on small to medium bolt-ons. Evoqua, we can fairly ring fence within the business, but there's other parts of the portfolio where we do want to continue to be inquisitive, with again with small to medium bolt-ons. And we'll continue our disciplined approach, and we're evaluating our longer term capital allocation framework, and we'll share more about that in Investor Day in May. Good morning, Andy. Yes, I think again, a lot of that is not changed from what we've said in the past. It's just, I think, being balanced in our approach and with a watchful eye to China. We've got that flat year-over-year, but there could be some potential headwinds there. And also with Applied Water, which is some of that cyclicality and timing as we think about that, Andy. So, from a long-term framework, none of that's changed. It's just really more thinking about in the context of 2024 and, thinking about going out with a balanced approach. We do have a lot of healthy demand across our largest end markets. When you look at the year from a seasonality standpoint, it's normalized. There's no change in terms of the seasonality of our business and how we ramp from Q1 through the balance of the year. I think the thing I'd leave you with too, is our margin guide reflects low 40s pro forma incrementals. And so, we feel really, really strong about the margin that we're delivering as well in the growth. Hey, good morning, Nathan. Hey, Nate, I'll take it. It's Matthew. Yes, we're making good progress on the past view backlog. If you remember, we started 2023 around 30% past due. We exited at 20. And we feel that we're going to get through the bulk of the past due backlog in 2024. Some of that may stray into '25. But for the most part, we feel pretty confident that we'll get through the past due backlog in 2024 with, again, with a little bit of carryover into '25. And so, really from a bottleneck standpoint, it really just comes down to our customers' ability to go out and execute the deployments. Chip supply is flowing. We've made investments over the past few years in our capacity. So, there's no capacity limitations from our point of view internally here at Xylem in our four walls. Hey, good morning, Joe. Yes, I mean, I've been pretty bullish on this. You've heard me talk about being the aggregator of data in the utilities, much like, folks are in the building management world or in the residential home. We believe we have the capabilities through this partnership to be able to be the leader in aggregating utility data. We're off to a really good start. We only had about six months under our belt last year once we got the combination closed. The teams have made great progress globally and we built a significant pipeline. And one of the things I've talked about is, it's one thing is to get the platform in play at the utility, but it's about building on the applications as well as pulling through our core products. So, a little bit of a land and expand is how I would frame it. Get the platform in place, help them optimize their water networks with our applications as well as pulling through our products like AMI, our treatment products, et cetera. So, we've had some significant wins. Some of those I've highlighted on prior calls. We continue to have wins and build momentum. Like I said, and it's not a specific region, it's across the world, whether that's in the U.K., Italy. We just won a big deal in the Middle East, which is for a new city with fully digitizing their water management system with this platform. And I've talked in the past about some of the deals in Spain and the U.S. we've done, in terms of putting the platform in and being able to sell AMI deals as well as treatment products. So, I think it can be a big opportunity for us. Obviously, we'll give you a lot more color as we as we get closer to May 30th at our Investor Day. But we're really bullish on the partnership. Yes, that's kind of a shorter to medium term objective, and we've already had some wins. We just had one in South Africa, actually, where we took the capital from the legacy of local business through the legacies island business in South Africa. So, we were able to execute and deploy that capital into an industrial application without really having to have service, folks on the ground and infrastructure. So, those are things that we're focused on kind of in the short to medium term is leveraging the product side and really the capital side of the legacy of local business through those island channels, both in the U.S. as well as internationally. So, we are all starting to see progress there. Yes, I just want to thank everybody for joining our call today, and for your interest in Xylem. We look forward to speaking again in early May, followed by our Investor Day on May 30, where we're going to provide more details on our long-term outlook. Take care, and make it a great day."

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode, and the floor will be open for questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions].  I would like to now turn the call over to Andrea van der Berg, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. \nAndrea van der Berg : Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Xylem's third quarter 2023 earnings conference. With me today are Chief Executive Officer, Patrick Decker; Chief Operating Officer, Matthew Pine; Senior Advisor and former Chief Financial Officer, Sandy Rowland; and Chief Financial Officer, Bill Grogan.  They will provide their perspectives on Xylem's third quarter 2023 results and discuss the fourth quarter and full year outlook. Following our prepared remarks, we will address questions related to the information covered on the call.  I'll ask that you please keep to one question and a follow-up, and then return to the queue. As a reminder, this call and our webcast are accompanied by a slide presentation available in the investor section of our website. A replay of today's call will be available until midnight, November 7. Additionally, the call will be available for playback via the investor section of our website under the heading Investor Events.  Please turn to slide two. We will make some forward-looking statements in today's call, including references to future events or developments that we anticipate will or may occur in the future. These statements are subject to future risks and uncertainties, such as those factors described in Xylem's most recent annual report on Form 10-K and in subsequent reports filed with SEC.  Please note that the company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements publicly to reflect subsequent events or circumstances, and actual events or results could differ materially from those anticipated.  Please turn to slide three. We have provided you with a summary of our key performance metrics, including both GAAP and non-GAAP metrics. For purposes of today's call, all references will be on an organic and or adjusted basis unless otherwise indicated, and non-GAAP financials have been reconciled for you and are included in the appendix section of the presentation.  Now, please turn to slide four, and I'll turn the call over to our CEO, Patrick Decker. \nPatrick Decker : Thanks, Andrea. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. By now you'll have seen that our first full quarter as a combined company was Xylem and Evoqua together. The team delivered very strong performance across each of our segments. We significantly exceeded expectations on organic revenue growth, EBITDA margin and earnings per share, and revenue grew 10% organically.  We expanded EBITDA margin well above prior year, and we delivered EPS of $0.99 to the quarter, which represents 14% growth year-over-year. Orders were up 3%, and more importantly, our backlogs continue to grow, especially in our M&CS and ISS segments. Total backlog is now $5.2 billion, and this sets us up for continued growth momentum and demonstrates the health of our key end markets.  So on the strength of this performance, we are raising our full year guidance. I want to personally give a big shout out to the team for their strong operational performance during a period of integrating two large enterprises. Instead of getting distracted, the team continued to focus on serving our customers and delivering on our commitments. The integration of Evoqua is well on track to deliver the cost synergies we promised.  It's those synergies that underwrote the transaction, but more importantly, it's the growth synergies that excite us the most. And our customers have already begun to experience the advantages of our combined capabilities.  Overall, the quarter's strong result, it reflects our continued momentum. And that puts me in a very privileged position on my last earnings call as CEO of Xylem. In September, we announced the planned succession of both me as CEO and Sandy as CFO.  Matthew Pine is going to lead Xylem as CEO beginning January 1. I'll remain on as an advisor through the end of March. I'd also like to formally welcome our new CFO, Bill Grogan who is on the call with us today. He's alongside Sandy Rowland. Bill took on the role of CFO on October 1, and it's been a real pleasure to welcome him to the team.  Now as Sandy was in the Chair through the end of September, she's going to cover the third quarter results, but that's not going to happen before I take the opportunity to thank her for her many significant contributions as Xylem. She's been a great partner and a great leader over the last few years with me and the team. We simply would not be where we are today without her many contributions. So now over to you Sandy. \nSandy Rowland : Thank you, Patrick. Before I go over the quarter's performance, I would like to take a moment to congratulate Bill. In the short time since he stepped into the CFO role, I've been impressed with how quickly he has immersed himself in the business and taken on financial leadership of the company.  Like Patrick, I will continue to stay on as an advisor through March to ensure a smooth transition, but the company will be in great hands with Bill working alongside Matthew next year and I couldn't be more confident in Xylem's future.  And now, let's look at the quarter. Please turn to slide five. As Patrick mentioned, the team has continued to deliver strong performance in Q3, exceeding expectations on growth, margin expansion, and earnings per share. Each segment outperformed including Integrated Solutions & Services. As a reminder, since the combination with the Evoqua, we began including ISS as our fourth reporting segment.  For Xylem overall, total revenues grew 50%, while organic revenue rose 10%, led by particularly robust double-digit growth in the U.S. Western Europe grew a healthy 6% and emerging markets was down largely due to China, despite strengths in other parts of Asia and also in Africa.  From an end-market perspective, utilities grew 16%, mainly driven by robust demand and price realization in both M&CS and water infrastructure. Industrial grew 5%, driven by strong demand in the U.S. and healthy demand in Western Europe. Lastly, building solutions grew 3% with strength in developed markets, more than offsetting moderation in emerging markets.  Overall, demand remains resilient. Our backlog is now $5.2 billion, up 5% organically, and this includes a $1.3 billion contribution from Evoqua. Orders were up 3% in the quarter and book-to-bill for the company was approximately one. EBITDA margin was 19.8%, up 150 basis points from the prior year on higher volumes, productivity savings, and favorable price-cost dynamics. Our EPS in the quarter was $0.99, up 14% year-over-year.  Please turn to slide six, and I'll review each segment's third quarter performance in a bit more detail. M&CS revenue was up 25%, driven primarily by improved chip supply and backlog execution, as well as strength in test and measurement. All regions saw double-digit growth, led by an impressive 31% in the U.S.  Orders were down in the quarter due to the timing of metrology orders, while assessment services saw strong growth. Year-to-date, book-to-bill remains above one for the segment.  Our M&CS backlog of $2.3 billion is up 11% organically versus the prior year, a reflection of strong continuing demand for our AMI offerings and the accelerating trend towards digitization. EBITDA margin for the segment was up 190 basis points versus the prior year, driven by volume conversion, price realization, and productivity, more than offsetting inflation.  And now let's turn to slide seven, and I'll cover our water infrastructure business. Water infrastructure outperformed due to stronger-than-expected price realization and backlog execution, with reported growth of 40% and organic growth of 7%.  As a reminder, we have integrated Evoqua's applied products technology business into the water infrastructure segment, further building out our treatment portfolio. This business outperformed expectations driven by stronger backlog execution. For both, utilities and industrials, the U.S. saw robust growth, while Western Europe proved resilient, offsetting some weakness in emerging markets. Organic orders in the quarter were up 14% year-over-year, and each region saw double-digit growth with particular strength in developed markets. EBITDA margin for the segment was up 50 basis points and 80 basis points when excluding the contribution of Evoqua.  Please turn to slide eight for an overview of Applied Water. Applied Water revenues grew 1% on continued backlog execution, modestly better than expectations of flat revenue growth. Growth in building solutions was driven by continued strength in commercial, particularly in the U.S.  While industrial was down modestly, there was resilient growth in developed markets, offset by moderation in emerging markets. Orders were up 2% in the quarter on strength in the U.S. And segment EBITDA margin expanded 20 basis points with continued strong price-cost dynamics and productivity, more than offsetting volume declines.  Please turn to slide nine. Last quarter, we introduced Integrated Solutions & Services as our fourth segment. ISS brings a durable recurring revenue base from businesses including outsourced water, which provide outcome-based treatment services to customers.  In its first full quarter with Xylem, ISS revenue exceeded our expectations as implied in our reported guidance. On a pro forma basis, ISS revenue grew 10% year-over-year, driven by strong price realization and backlog execution.  Orders grew on a pro forma basis by 12% year-over-year with broad-based demand across industrials and utilities. Book-to-bill was greater than one, and backlog exceeded $1 billion to end the quarter up 14% year-over-year on a pro forma basis. Adjusted EBITDA margin was strong at 22.6%, driven by price realization and productivity.  And now let's turn to slide 10 for an overview of cash flows and the company's financial position. Our position remains robust as we exit the quarter with over $700 million in cash and available liquidity of $1.7 billion. Net debt to EBITDA leverage is 1.2x. And year-to-date we have adjusted free cash flow conversion of 94%.  Please turn to slide 11, and I'll hand it back over to Patrick. \nPatrick Decker: Thanks, Sandy. Today is the 12th Anniversary of Xylem's listing on the Newark Stock Exchange. And I think it's pretty fair to say that 12 years ago, water wasn't very widely recognized as an investable thesis. But since then, intensifying secular trends have made absolutely clear, the value of a platform of solutions to meet the global water challenges. In that time, Xylem has evolved in our composition, our scale, and our impact. But our investment thesis has remained constant. It's one that's focused on a multi-year runway of attractive organic growth with sustainable margin expansion and strong free cash flow conversion. And it's that financial strength and confidence that allows us to effectively deploy capital as we continue building a differentiated market-leading water solutions platform.  Under that thesis, we built a very durable business model. And Xylem colleagues and partners around the world are creating significant economic and social value as we serve our customers and communities around the world.  I am both proud of what we built so far, but also excited to see what Xylem is capable of becoming under Matthew's leadership. Matthew and I have worked side by side for the three and a half years. So this handover is progressing very smoothly. And I have total confidence he will lead this team to realize the full promise of our strategy and create an even greater impact and value in the years to come.  So now, over to you Matthew. \nMatthew Pine: Thank you, Patrick. I am grateful and energized at the prospect of building on Xylem's momentum and creating our next phase of growth and impact. I'm also deeply grateful for Patrick's passionate, visionary leadership. His legacy is Xylem's bright future, having put Xylem firmly on a path of continuing profitable growth.  The strength of our partnership is making it easy to deliver the continuity essential to all stakeholders in this handover as we approach the turn of the year. And as Patrick said, our thesis is constant, our strategy is sound, and we are committed to our long-range plan.  Our team is solving customers' greatest water challenges with the most advanced platform of solutions in the world. In a fragmented, complex market, that integrated offering is a distinctive, competitive advantage. The opportunity ahead of us is to make it easier for even more customers to access the full range of capabilities they need to solve their most critical water challenges. In the process, we'll grow our penetration, our profitability, our durability, and our impact. The team and I look forward to sharing more color about the next phase of our growth at an Investor Day in May next year.  We'll provide a further update on our combined company opportunity and long-range plan then. In the meantime, I'm pleased to share our nearer-term outlook. I'll provide a brief update on our Evoqua integration, and then a picture of what we expect in our end markets over the next period. And then finally, I'll ask Bill to provide guidance for the remainder of the year.  Moving to slide 12, as you can see, the integration of Evoqua has gained quick momentum, and the team has come together remarkably fast. There's great collaboration, and we have the benefit of bringing two highly complemented cultures with a similarly strong sense of purpose together.  We committed $140 million of cost synergies within three years, as well as exiting 2023 with a $40 million run rate. And as Patrick mentioned, that's well on track. But the rationale for the combination has always been about growth, the opportunity to create more value serving customers with our combined capabilities.  In utilities, we'll deepen our penetration, especially with the addition of Evoqua's applied product technology offerings through our water infrastructure segment. The combination allows us to provide even more comprehensive treatment solutions in both clean water and wastewater.  In industrial, we will scale our presence in attractive verticals with services offerings of ISS. We see long-term market expansion in growing verticals such as microelectronics, power, life sciences, and food and beverage. And geographically, we will scale Evoqua's products and solutions internationally, including the services business, by leveraging Xylem's global distribution platform.  Both Xylem and Evoqua were market leaders on their own, but together, we're in even a stronger position. We are already seeing the benefits of scale, reach and integrated offerings, and a robust pipeline of global opportunities, as well as the combined wins both teams are posting.  And as we integrate our two businesses even more deeply, we'll take advantage of the opportunity to optimize our portfolio for growth. That will include structuring our offerings in ways that are matched to how our end markets address water management. The job is to make it even simpler for them to access solutions they need, and we're already hearing how customers appreciate having fewer vendors to coordinate across multiple domains.  Now, let's turn to slide 13, and I'll cover the outlook for our end markets. Our outperformance in the first three quarters of the year provides great momentum to build on. I especially want to echo Patrick's shout out to all of our teams for delivering such a standout performance this year, and in the third quarter. It's that kind of commitment and discipline that demonstrates the team's ability to execute through a dynamic macroeconomic environment.  That said, we continue to take a balanced outlook and are monitoring signs of softness on a regional level, particularly in China, and some end markets addressed by our Applied Water Segment.  As a reminder, our 2023 outlook is expressed on an organic basis. At a high level, we anticipate that utilities demand will continue to be resilient, and industrial demand will provide steady growth. Utilities compromise approximately 45% of revenue. They continue to show healthy demand, and we continue to expect growth of mid-teens.  On the clean water side, we continue to see robust demand for our AMI solutions. On top of that, we're driving backlog execution on improved chip supply, and we're seeing even more traction on solution selling with our digital platform as customers increasingly value bundled offerings. We now anticipate growth of mid-20s up from low-20s previously.  On the wastewater side, OpEx is expected to remain resilient in developed markets, alongside steady CapEx spend across regions, underpinning demand. We expect to see high single-digit growth in wastewater overall.  Turning to industrial end market, which is about 45% of our revenue, we now expect global growth of high single digits up from mid-single digits. Developed markets continue to be resilient, although there are pockets of moderation in emerging markets.  Lastly, in building solutions, which is about 10% of our revenue, we continue to expect growth of mid-single digits, driven by steady replacement business, particularly in commercial applications.  Overall, the demand outlook continues to be positive despite some variability in macro indicators. While the organic view does not include Evoqua, the demand profile in ISS is resilient on a foundation of recurring revenues, further increasing the durability of our business.  Now, I have the pleasure of turning the call over to Bill for the first time to walk through our Q4 guidance. \nBill Grogan : Thanks, Matthew, and thanks Patrick and Sandy for your kind words. I'm incredibly grateful to Sandy for being so generous with her insight about the business during this handover. She has built a strong team and culture, and I wish her well in her new endeavors.  I want to start by saying how excited I am to join the Xylem team. I have long admired the company, both because of its rise to sector leadership and also because of its distinctive commitment to both social and economic value creation. And now, a month in, I'm even more compelled by the opportunities ahead of us. It is a privilege to be part of the team that will take Xylem forward, building on this extraordinary platform and performance. As Patrick mentioned, we are increasing our full-year revenue EBITDA margin and EPS guidance. Full-year revenue will now be approximately $7.3 billion. This translates to total revenue growth of about 32% and organic revenue growth of about 11%, up from 9% to 10% previously.  We are raising EBITDA margin to approximately 19%, up from 18%, driven by higher volume, stronger price realization, and productivity initiatives. This reflects about 200 basis points of margin expansion versus the prior year. In addition, we are lifting full-year adjusted EPS guidance to $3.71 to $3.73, up from $3.60 at the midpoint.  The revised guidance breaks down by segment as follows: Low 20s growth in M&CS, up from approximately 20% previously, high single-digit growth in water infrastructure, and mid-single digit growth in Applied Water. And we remain committed to achieving free cash flow conversion of above 100% of net income. We have also provided you with a number of full-year assumptions in the appendix on slide 19.  And now, drilling down on the fourth quarter. We anticipate total revenue growth will be in the 35% to 36% range on a reported basis, and 4% to 5% organically. By segment, we expect revenue growth to be mid-teens in M&CS, low single digits in water infrastructure, and remain flat in Applied Water.  We expect fourth quarter EBITDA margin to be approximately 19.5%, driven by higher volumes, continued price realization, and productivity gains. This yields fourth quarter EPS of $0.94 to $0.96. Our operational discipline, commercial momentum, and backlog strength give us confidence to the remainder of the year in delivering our long-term plan.  With that, please turn to slide 15, and I'll turn the call back over to Patrick for closing comments.\nPatrick Decker : Thanks, Bill, and thank you Matthew and Sandy. This is a bittersweet moment for me. I'm wrapping up my last earnings call with Xylem.  Leading and helping build this enterprise has been absolutely the greatest privilege of my career. I'm so proud of what the team has achieved in the past 10 years. Of the work that we've done alongside our partners, serving our customers and communities, and of the value we've created together. That said, it's clear to me personally, we are only just beginning to realize our full potential. Xylem is strongly positioned, our momentum is accelerating, and there has never been a greater need for solutions to the world's water challenges. It's incredibly gratifying to know that me, that my more than 22,000 Xylem colleagues and our partners are going to take the work of solving water forward under an exceptionally strong leadership team. We are poised to have an even greater impact and to create even more value in the many years to come.  On a final personal note to the many of you whose jobs include closely tracking and analyzing our business, I've come to know you quite well as you followed Xylem's growth. I admire and respect the work that you do. All the very best to each of you, and simply go keep making a difference.  Now, we're going to take your questions, and so operator, let's open it up for Q&A. \nOperator: The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions]. We'll take our first question from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. \nDeane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. \nSandy Rowland: Morning, Dean. \nPatrick Decker : Good morning. \nDeane Dray: You'll have to indulge me. I need to start with some important congratulations, so let me just rattle through them here. So Sandy, thank you for all your help and wish you all the best. Matthew, you and I have already connected twice in person since the announcement, but in my view, you've got the right skill set and leadership to lead Xylem from here, so congrats.  And Bill, Bill, welcome. And I don't want to put too much pressure on you, but we are expecting the same sort of elite CFO contributions that we saw for years at IDEX, so congrats and welcome to you. \nBill Grogan : Appreciate it, Deane. \nDeane Dray: All right, so, and Patrick, no tissues here, but you've had a fabulous 10-year run. You're handing off the reins truly in it from a position of strength, and I just remember when you joined Xylem, it was a company that thought of itself as a pump company. I mean, that's what they said. And the entire portfolio has evolved to where, I love how you phrase it, you're solving water.  So just, you should feel really proud about how you developed the company and the portfolio and the leadership team, so congrats. \nPatrick Decker : Thank you, Deane, and that means a lot coming from you. You've been here from the beginning.\nDeane Dray: Yes sir, yes sir. All right, so let's just talk about the quarter if we could, and maybe start with Evoqua and how the business \u2013 Matthew referenced some new wins. Just how have the revenue synergy started, conversations with customers, what'll be the first opportunities maybe to take Evoqua's business with existing customers to Europe? So any color there would be helpful. Thanks. \nMatthew Pine: Yeah, thanks Deane for the question. Maybe I'll just start at a very high level and just talk about the guiding principles that Patrick really stated when we did the deal, which I think were really important to our execution.  The first was, we said we have to deliver on our \u201823 plans, and as you can see from Q3, really strong performance. As most of you know, that was the legacy Evoqua's business Q4 in this past fiscal calendar Q3. So great execution by the team, and I couldn't be happier.  The second, we need to make sure we deliver on the value capture of the cost and revenue synergies. And on what I would call the softer side, which is equally as important when you bring two companies together, is to make sure we get the right talent on the field or the pitch, if you will, and make sure we retain top talent. We've done a really nice job there.  And then lastly, bringing the best to both cultures together. So obviously the work's not done, but we're off to a good start, and those guiding principles have helped really get momentum in the business.  Just quickly on cost synergies, we're tracking at the $40 million exit rate that we talked about, and those three buckets of corporate costs, procurement, and footprint. But more so on the revenue synergies, which you're getting at Deane, the momentum is strong. We've just completed the APT integration into water infrastructure, which is really a milestone for us.  We've appointed regional synergy leads in each one of the regions to drive the value capture. The incentives are in place, and the training's ongoing, both for the sales team as well as the services organization.  The short term, as you talk about, really the short term we're focused on cross-selling our products into industrial and back into municipal. I think the services, which I'll touch on in a minute, has been the biggest surprise so far. Midterm, we're going to leverage the Xylem footprint in Europe to bring capital products to customers, to the Evoqua products that are international, and bringing those folks from the U.S. to international. And then lastly, long term we're moving our services internationally.  But I wanted to give you an example of an early synergy win. We have a power customer, it's an oil and gas \u2013 well, actually it's an oil and gas customer, where we do the process water for them. It's a build-on operate. We do not do the wastewater and they had their wastewater system go down and it was crippling their operations. So within really 48 hours, we were able to bring the legacy businesses together, both on the treatment side, as well as the pumping and transport of wastewater in that facility and keep them up and running, and also keep them away from having fines.  We've had several examples like that where we can bring a full solution to the customer with one phone call, and I think that's really important. So off to a great start. There's many examples like that, but we'll be able to give a lot more context as we roll into 2024. \nDeane Dray : That's all really good to hear. And if I could have a follow-up on M&CS, just your update on the chip supply. It looks like we continue to see gradual improvement there. And any comments about the orders in the third quarter and just kind of what the funnel looks like? Thanks. \nMatthew Pine: Yeah, I'll start with orders and I'll come back to chip supply. Although we were down 11%, backlog is up 11%, $2.3 billion in M&CS, book-to-bill ratio greater than one. Deane, the bid activity remains really strong in M&CS, especially metrology. Really the reason for the decline in orders in the quarter was more of a timing of the backlog conversion to orders.  As you know, a lot of the larger AMI deals, they sit in backlog for a period of time, anywhere from three to 12 months, while the utility is getting ready for the deployment. And when we receive the PO is when we book it as an order. So it's more of a timing issue, and that can be a little bit lumpy. But in general, we're really bullish on AMI adoption, and it's still fairly early innings.  On the chip supply, the original guide this year for the business was low teens. Now we're in the low 20s. So we've seen continual gradual chip improvement quarter-over-quarter. I think this quarter it came in a little faster than we had thought, and it can be lumpy. But really chip supply in Q3 was strong. We see that continued momentum into Q4, especially with our product redesigns. And then obviously we've got -- with the backlog, we have a lot of potential in \u201824 in M&CS. \nPatrick Decker: Deane, this is Patrick. Just to punctuate what Matthew had said, in that segment again, orders are only a function of when POs are placed. The key metric there is what's happening with backlog. And again, the backlog is very healthy, the deal pipeline is very healthy, and the win rate, especially in North America, is very impressive for AMI. \nDeane Dray : Great. That all sounds good, and congrats again to everyone. \nMatthew Pine: Thank you, Deane. \nPatrick Decker : Thanks, Deane.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Mike Halloran with Baird. Your line is open. \nMike Halloran : Hey. Good morning, everyone. \nPatrick Decker : Hey, good morning. \nSandy Rowland : Hey Mike. \nMike Halloran : So like Deane, thanks Patrick for everything over the years. It's been a long, long run, but we really appreciate everything. Sandy, same. Not quite as long, but best of luck moving forward. And obviously Bill and Matthew, I look forward to working with both of you. So I appreciate it, everyone. \nPatrick Decker : Thanks Mike. \nMike Halloran : I don't think I've had four congratulations on a call before. \nPatrick Decker : Yeah. Hey Mike, we don't do things orthodox here, so \u2013 but we do them the right way through, it's called succession planning. So thank you. \nMike Halloran : No problem. All right. So following up on Deane's M&CS order question, maybe broaden it out a little bit. If you think about end markets heading into 2024, I certainly appreciate Matthew's comments on the fourth quarter itself. Where are the optimistic points? Where are the concern points? A lot of moving pieces here, right? You have really strong backlog. You have some regulatory tailwinds that are starting to hit or at least it seems like it. But you also have this uncertain macro backdrop in some of these emerging market regions where there's a little less clarity. So maybe just talk about some of those moving pieces as you're thinking about next year and where you think there could be some demand sustainability or where you have a little bit more concern points. \nMatthew Pine: No, it's a great question Mike. We're committed to both the legacy businesses, long-range plans that were presented back in \u201821. Just start right there and just get that out. And really we have great momentum heading into next year with the platform that's been built by the Evoqua, Xylem combination. If you look back over the past decade of Patrick's leadership, 50% of the company didn't exist six or seven short years ago, and we're really operating from a position of strength in terms of the platform that has been built. So that feels really good as a jump-off point.  I think if you kind of think about the macro drivers or favorable drivers, the secular trends continue to be strong, scarcity of water, aged infrastructure in developed markets, water quality is increasingly an issue, and as many of us have seen this year with flooding happening all over the world.  So those trends will continue and they'll continue to buoy the business. Government funding, we talk a lot about the funding. It's going to be a dimmer switch. It's going to come over a period of time. But the next six to seven years, we'll see continued trickle funding globally, not only in the US. I think the resiliency of our OpEx and utilities will continue to be a strong point. I think the ISS durable business model, with the combination coming together with 75% services and aftermarket, gives us a lot more diversity of cash flows as we move into \u201824. And then lastly, M&CS backlog, which we just talked about with the supply chain improvements, I think are all positives.  I think if I had to mention a few watch items, our more cyclical pieces of the portfolio with the end markets and applied water are definitely a watch item. There's pockets of industrial weakness. It's really niche when you think about Ag or marine, but they are very small pieces of our business. But in general, industrial has tended to hold up pretty well.  And then I think the last thing I'd mentioned is China, which I mentioned in the opening comments. Industrial has remained pretty resilient in China for us. It's been the utilities, but it's been more on just a push to the right more than anything in China, which we can talk a little bit more about that later, but that's kind of the insights that we give. Obviously in our February earnings call, we'll be able to give more color, but that's what I see right now. \nMike Halloran : Great. I appreciate that. And then second question, just on the pricing and mix. So price costs in the quarter sounds like the backlog for M&CS is better than the margin profile today, which makes a lot of sense. Maybe just talk about some of those two dynamics as you're looking forward ability to continue to manage the price side of things against resilient inflation and how we should think about mix on a forward basis. \nMatthew Pine: Yeah, this price cost in Q3, continue to be positive for Xylem. We're up 70 bips. We expect pricing to moderate in 2024 as we lap previous increases. I think \u201824 is going to fall more in line with historical trends, but in terms of M&CS, definitely price costs contributed to a little bit of the incrementals this quarter. But we feel really positive in a step up in Q4 and into \u201824, we've taken some pricing actions that will start to really materialize into \u201824. And in terms of the mix, it'll continue to be a little bit lumpy with energy, but we're working that backlog down and we expect that to normalize as we get into \u201824. \nMike Halloran : Great. I appreciate it. Thanks everyone. \nMatthew Pine: Thank you.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Scott Davis with Melius Research. \nScott Davis: Hey, good morning, everyone. \nMatthew Pine: Good morning.\nSandy Rowland: Good morning, Scott. \nPatrick Decker: Good morning, Scott. \nScott Davis: I'll let Dean's congratulations kind of take the lead for me. And since he's the elder statesman, I will defer to him, but I agree with everything you said to everybody. \nPatrick Decker: Thank you, Scott. Thank you. \nScott Davis: No problem. Matthew, can you, just on China, can you guys help us understand kind of the interplay between OpEx and CapEx? I mean, when I assume it's all CapEx that's declined and pushed to the right, but is there a certain OpEx impact as well? \nMatthew Pine: Yeah, I think it's \u2013 yeah, in terms of China, yeah. The under \u2013 I\u2019ll just say, the underlying demand does remain fairly healthy. It's like I said, industrial has been more resilient than utilities, but with regard to utilities, it's a little bit of a mixed bag. It's really timing of funding, not only for CapEx, but also for OpEx as well.  And as we've seen in the treatment piece of our business, in China it's been actually a little bit more resilient than transport. Transport tends to be a bit more OpEx centric. So it's a little bit of a mixed bag, Scott, when it comes to the funding. It's both CapEx and OpEx. \nPatrick Decker: Hey Scott, I guess two weeks ago I was \u2013 two weeks ago I was there for a week and I spent time with our leadership gang and the team and visited our locations in Nanjing, Shenyang, Shanghai, traveled around, met with customers, met with the team, and the whole purpose was to really get a sense for kind of how things feel in China. And all I can say is based upon our portfolio, what we have there.  Yeah, there's some near term shifting to the right on when backlog gets converted on the utility side, but underlying demand is still very strong there. That market is very positive and as many of you've heard me say before, as my father said, every generation thinks theirs is the last. This is my third time talking about the future of China in terms of demand for water and environment, and things felt very, very good in terms of robust underlying demand. \nScott Davis: That makes sense. You guys, I don't think I ever \u2013 I'm not sure. I haven't asked this question. I don't think you've talked about it or maybe you have, and I just didn't remember, but how are you integrating the R&D efforts between Evoqua and Xylem? How are you kind of integrating and eliminating duplication if there was any? I would assume there'd be some maybe like in things like PFAS and things like that. And then how are you prioritizing projects with \u2013 assuming there is some level of integration, but I'll just let you guys comment on that. Thanks. \nMatthew Pine: That's a great question. We haven't talked a lot about the R&D synergies, but for sure they are there. Let me first start out by Snehal Desai leading that team. And I\u2019m actually here in DC today with his leadership team.  So he comes over from the legacy of Evoqua business. And yes, there is some overlap, especially when you think about the work that's being done in PFAS, both obviously the capture technologies there about the destruction and the sensing is really where the innovations required. And obviously one plus one can equal three there. We were both working on that to get \u2013 separately. But now together, we think we can get there more efficiently and in a more expedited fashion.  But in general, yes, there were different solutions that we were working on separately, that as we come together we can get leverage from that combined spend and really that effort. \nPatrick Decker: And I think Scott, I would just add that part of our innovation effort, because R&D is only one part of innovation, was through the partnerships that we have through academia, venture capital startups coming to us, and that's where I think the scale and platform of Xylem and our relationships will benefit what the legacy Evoqua business was looking to capture, around things like PFAS, but other treatment solutions facing our customers. \nScott Davis: It makes sense. Best of luck, everybody. Take care. Congrats on the quarter. \nMatthew Pine: Thank you.\nPatrick Decker: Thanks Scott. \nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Nathan Jones with Stifel. \nNathan Jones : Good morning, everyone. \nPatrick Decker: Hey, good morning, Nate. \nNathan Jones : I'll add my congratulations to Patrick and Sandy and congratulations to Bill and Matthew. \nPatrick Decker: Thank you. \nBill Grogan: Thanks Nathan. \nNathan Jones : Maybe just emerging markets outside of China. I mean, you've talked about some of the issues that China saw in the quarter and not particular to your business, I don't think, but maybe you could talk about the emerging market performance outside of China. \nMatthew Pine: Yeah, I think ex-China, emerging markets has been pretty resilient for us across all different end markets, Nate. I think with the exception would probably be a little bit of weakness in the Middle East and our applied water business. But in general, if you look at the other businesses, they've been really resilient outside of China. And it's helped kind of buoy the \u2013 a little bit of the tough push to the right that we've seen in China. That's across all different regions; Africa, Northern Asia, Southeast Asia, India and Australia, New Zealand. \nNathan Jones : I think for the follow-up, I'll ask about the Idrica partnership, Xylem\u2019s new adoption. You guys had some pretty broad presentations at ACE and at WEFTEC this year. So maybe you can talk about customer reception to those kinds of things and customer uptake for those kinds of things. \nMatthew Pine: Yeah, no, it's been fabulous. Actually, it's exceeded our expectations. We've engaged over 200 customers globally, and it's \u2013 the thing I'm excited about, it's been really balanced across the globe, both the U.S., Europe, and emerging markets. We've got a tremendous pipeline built. We're working now on executing from orders to sales and deployment.  I did \u2013 if you remember, I highlighted \u2013 I'm going to highlight a couple of examples. One was in the U.S. in a southeastern city, a large city, we're able to cut what I'll say, land and expand. We took the platform, the digital platform and the utility to aggregate all their applications and then making it easy for them. Then we bolted on two of our own applications, which is recurring revenue. And then from there we picked up a $40 million AMI deal. So it's kind of land and expand, but it's also pulling through our products and solutions.  On the heels of that, we just also picked up in Europe from a large European utility, $20 million of treatment in metrology in southern Europe, the same situation. They have the platform implemented and we're able to leverage our relationship and pull through treatment and AMI solution.  So I've talked a lot about the platform being the consolidator of utilities information. We believe that's true, but the pull through we're getting and the relationships we're building allows us to bundle our offerings, and that's really exciting. \nPatrick Decker: And Nate, I \u2013 Matthew, he led the effort on cultivating the Idrica opportunity over a number of years, and obviously he's been involved in cultivating the Evoqua opportunity over a few years. What I would just offer up here is, this has always been as we've said, about helping our customers turn the lights on, on their infrastructure to understand, have a better feel for what's going on in infrastructure, so that when they spend the next dollar of CapEx or OpEx, where best to spend it.  And I think the, the few opportunities that Matthew mentioned already, where it's the pull through, that is as much the opportunity as the initial services sell to the customer. \nNathan Jones : Maybe you'll have to add a discussion on the revenue synergies from Idrica to the revenue synergies from Evoqua at the Analyst Day next year. \nMatthew Pine: Yeah, I think, but I think it's a good comment, because we do think the platform has scalability into the industrial and building services business. Obviously we're going to stay focused on utilities at first. So we stay focused and deliver, but it does have ability to expand into industrial. \nNathan Jones : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. \nMatthew Pine: Thank you. \nPatrick Decker : Thank you.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Joe Giordano with TD Cowen. \nJoe Giordano: Hey guys. Good morning. \nMatthew Pine: Hey. Good morning, Joe. \nPatrick Decker : Hey. Good morning Joe.\nJoe Giordano: Hey, Patrick, Sandy. I mean, thank you for everything. Congratulations. And with five simultaneous calls going on today for me, being done with earnings calls sounds wonderful. So I'm very jealous for both of you. Congratulations. \nSandy Rowland: Thank you, Joe. \nPatrick Decker : Thanks Joe. \nJoe Giordano: Bill, maybe I'll start with you. Like as you come over from IDEX and you kind of want to bring the best of what that firm had, like how do you kind of kick-start an 80/20 kind of culture here? What's involved in really doing that and driving it to be like at the forefront? \nBill Grogan: Yeah, no, a great question. And the team had already started that initiative before I got here. They recognize that it's a core tool that ultimately frees up organizational capacity, right. Its focus is to eliminate complexity, focus on the things that matter most. There's obviously the core analytics from a product and customer perspective, but thinking about more broadly and then leveraging those tools to help enhance our strategy.  So we're doing it very much like we did at IDEX, piloting it in a couple of locations. Getting folks familiar with the tools and the concepts and then rolling it out more thoroughly as we have initial successes and wins. So it is something I think that's going to have a tremendous amount of value, both on the top and bottom line, creating velocity to innovation for our customers and creating longer term returns for our shareholders. \nPatrick Decker : And I think \u2013 this is Patrick. \nJoe Giordano: Go ahead, Patrick. \nPatrick Decker : Sorry, sorry, Joe. That's all right. I just add that I think the way I would encourage investors to look at this is we've spent the last decade building a platform that customers can access for their needs, which means growth. And when you've built that platform, then you have something to actually apply 80/20 to.  And so that's why right now is the perfect time for this combination to be coming together and Bill coming in with his toolkit. The team had already been working on this, but I think what he brings to the table is going to be incredibly valuable to the enterprise in terms of value creation. \nJoe Giordano: Is that concept even more applicable to the Evoqua platform? I just think of them as having been built from like almost a, we have everything kind of ethos, right, of being nationally available and having tons of different products. It just feels like given the breadth of SKUs there, like maybe something like this, whether it's keeping everything and just charging appropriately or like it just feels like it might be more appropriate for that business. Is that fair to think of it that way? \nBill Grogan : I think on balance, it'd be similar to the opportunities we have at Xylem that it's not hugely differentiated there. Obviously there's a \u2013 80/20 is applicable to all different business models. So the service aspect versus a product based organization, it's still a tool that will drive significant value. \nJoe Giordano: Okay. And then just last for me, is the infrastructure order rate, do you feel like that's stable here? It's probably a number that caught most people by surprise being that strong. So is that in dollars kind of a good number? \nMatthew Pine: Yeah, the water infrastructure order rate? Yeah. It included a couple of big projects in custom pump. But in general, yeah, we're seeing good demand, resilient demand, both in developed markets and ex-China and emerging markets. So we feel pretty good and it's been pretty resilient. \nJoe Giordano: Thanks, guys. I'll pass it along. \nMatthew Pine: Thanks, Joe. \nBill Grogan: Thanks, Joe. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. \nAndy Kaplowitz : Good morning, everyone. \nMatthew Pine: Hey, good morning, Andy. \nAndy Kaplowitz : Patrick, Sandy, congrats. We'll miss you. Matt and Bill, we're looking forward to working with you.  Maybe I could start. It just doesn't look like it, but are your customers outside of China changing their behavior at all based on higher interest rates or economic uncertainty? Your new public competitor in the water space mentioned that some North American municipalities are holding off on plant upgrades and some investments. But it doesn't seem like that is what your utility or industrial companies are doing. But maybe you can give us some more color on what you're seeing. \nMatthew Pine: Yeah, I would just maybe just specific to utilities and wastewater, I think, is the proxy for the question. Just a reminder that 50% of our revenue is outside the U.S. and 75% of that is OpEx, which can be a little bit different in terms of the mix. We're seeing continued resiliency in orders in developed markets leading the way with emerging markets kind of minus China, like I just said to Joe, contributing nicely.  With regard to CapEx, I'd point to our treatment orders, which are up 6% in Q3. And we have a healthy funnel and pipeline up 8%. We have been reaching out to customers, kind of qualitatively a cross section of customers across the globe, and specifically in the U.S. They don't really see a major funding shift in spending. Plus the addition of stimulus money that's going to trickle in over time, Andy, I think will also help kind of keep things stable.  But in general, we haven't we haven't really kind of seen anything that's alarming for us, it would be a watch item. \nPatrick Decker : Andy, this is Patrick. Again, one thing I would offer to investors as you think about, I know we have some new entrants into the space. I think it's important that our investors understand that we've got the broadest water platform that's out there. And so I think drilling down into what percentage of our total revenue actually overlaps with some of our competitors that are out there is an important thing to pay attention to.  The treatment bidding pipeline as Matthew alluded to, is the single most important indicator as the health of the utilities over time. And that continues to be up, I think, mid to high single digits. So that's a reflection of what the underlying health of utilities are. And again, I just offer that as something for you all to focus on. \nAndy Kaplowitz : Definitely appreciate that color guys. And then maybe I could ask you for a little bit more on what you are seeing in our applied water segment and specifically across your channel and channel inventory there. Can you give us color into sellout versus sell-in? Do you still see inventory is in balance? Do you see a period of slow orders for that segment where they just continue to be a bit lumpy? \nMatthew Pine: Yeah. You know, Andy, within our applied water business, we don\u2019t have a tremendous amount of stocking. Again, it\u2019s if you kind of Resi commercial over the overall Xylem business, it\u2019s only 10%, but a lot of our orders Andy or configure to order engineer to order, so therefore for a specific job. Yes, we have book and ship. It's mainly in our Resi business and a little bit commercially and a lot of that has kind of worked itself out.  If you look at our compares on the Resi business, which makes up 3% of our business, we're up on a year-over-year basis and we've kind of hit the bottom when we're coming out of the downturn on Resi. But again, it's a small part of our portfolio.\nAndy Kaplowitz : I appreciate the color guys. Congrats again.\nMatthew Pine: Thanks Andy.\nPatrick Decker : Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes the Q&A portion of today's call. I would now like to turn the floor over to Patrick Decker for closing remarks.\nPatrick Decker : Well, thank you all. I mean it's been a great privilege to work with such an extraordinary set of colleagues and partners over the past nearly 10 years. I couldn't be more proud of where we are today and I'm looking forward to seeing all that Matthew, Bill and the team are going to do is they take Xylem into its next chapter. The work has never been more important as to what Xylem is doing and this company has never been better positioned to make a difference, as we're committed to doing with our customers and communities around the world. Again, I want to thank you everyone and all the very best to you and your families. \nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's Xylem third quarter 2023 earnings conference call. Please disconnect your line at this time and have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Sandy Rowland",
            "content": "Thank you, Patrick. Before I go over the quarter's performance, I would like to take a moment to congratulate Bill. In the short time since he stepped into the CFO role, I've been impressed with how quickly he has immersed himself in the business and taken on financial leadership of the company.  Like Patrick, I will continue to stay on as an advisor through March to ensure a smooth transition, but the company will be in great hands with Bill working alongside Matthew next year and I couldn't be more confident in Xylem's future.  And now, let's look at the quarter. Please turn to slide five. As Patrick mentioned, the team has continued to deliver strong performance in Q3, exceeding expectations on growth, margin expansion, and earnings per share. Each segment outperformed including Integrated Solutions & Services. As a reminder, since the combination with the Evoqua, we began including ISS as our fourth reporting segment.  For Xylem overall, total revenues grew 50%, while organic revenue rose 10%, led by particularly robust double-digit growth in the U.S. Western Europe grew a healthy 6% and emerging markets was down largely due to China, despite strengths in other parts of Asia and also in Africa.  From an end-market perspective, utilities grew 16%, mainly driven by robust demand and price realization in both M&CS and water infrastructure. Industrial grew 5%, driven by strong demand in the U.S. and healthy demand in Western Europe. Lastly, building solutions grew 3% with strength in developed markets, more than offsetting moderation in emerging markets.  Overall, demand remains resilient. Our backlog is now $5.2 billion, up 5% organically, and this includes a $1.3 billion contribution from Evoqua. Orders were up 3% in the quarter and book-to-bill for the company was approximately one. EBITDA margin was 19.8%, up 150 basis points from the prior year on higher volumes, productivity savings, and favorable price-cost dynamics. Our EPS in the quarter was $0.99, up 14% year-over-year.  Please turn to slide six, and I'll review each segment's third quarter performance in a bit more detail. M&CS revenue was up 25%, driven primarily by improved chip supply and backlog execution, as well as strength in test and measurement. All regions saw double-digit growth, led by an impressive 31% in the U.S.  Orders were down in the quarter due to the timing of metrology orders, while assessment services saw strong growth. Year-to-date, book-to-bill remains above one for the segment.  Our M&CS backlog of $2.3 billion is up 11% organically versus the prior year, a reflection of strong continuing demand for our AMI offerings and the accelerating trend towards digitization. EBITDA margin for the segment was up 190 basis points versus the prior year, driven by volume conversion, price realization, and productivity, more than offsetting inflation.  And now let's turn to slide seven, and I'll cover our water infrastructure business. Water infrastructure outperformed due to stronger-than-expected price realization and backlog execution, with reported growth of 40% and organic growth of 7%.  As a reminder, we have integrated Evoqua's applied products technology business into the water infrastructure segment, further building out our treatment portfolio. This business outperformed expectations driven by stronger backlog execution. For both, utilities and industrials, the U.S. saw robust growth, while Western Europe proved resilient, offsetting some weakness in emerging markets. Organic orders in the quarter were up 14% year-over-year, and each region saw double-digit growth with particular strength in developed markets. EBITDA margin for the segment was up 50 basis points and 80 basis points when excluding the contribution of Evoqua.  Please turn to slide eight for an overview of Applied Water. Applied Water revenues grew 1% on continued backlog execution, modestly better than expectations of flat revenue growth. Growth in building solutions was driven by continued strength in commercial, particularly in the U.S.  While industrial was down modestly, there was resilient growth in developed markets, offset by moderation in emerging markets. Orders were up 2% in the quarter on strength in the U.S. And segment EBITDA margin expanded 20 basis points with continued strong price-cost dynamics and productivity, more than offsetting volume declines.  Please turn to slide nine. Last quarter, we introduced Integrated Solutions & Services as our fourth segment. ISS brings a durable recurring revenue base from businesses including outsourced water, which provide outcome-based treatment services to customers.  In its first full quarter with Xylem, ISS revenue exceeded our expectations as implied in our reported guidance. On a pro forma basis, ISS revenue grew 10% year-over-year, driven by strong price realization and backlog execution.  Orders grew on a pro forma basis by 12% year-over-year with broad-based demand across industrials and utilities. Book-to-bill was greater than one, and backlog exceeded $1 billion to end the quarter up 14% year-over-year on a pro forma basis. Adjusted EBITDA margin was strong at 22.6%, driven by price realization and productivity.  And now let's turn to slide 10 for an overview of cash flows and the company's financial position. Our position remains robust as we exit the quarter with over $700 million in cash and available liquidity of $1.7 billion. Net debt to EBITDA leverage is 1.2x. And year-to-date we have adjusted free cash flow conversion of 94%.  Please turn to slide 11, and I'll hand it back over to Patrick. Morning, Dean. Hey Mike. Good morning, Scott. Thank you, Joe."

            "name": "Bill Grogan",
            "content": "Thanks, Matthew, and thanks Patrick and Sandy for your kind words. I'm incredibly grateful to Sandy for being so generous with her insight about the business during this handover. She has built a strong team and culture, and I wish her well in her new endeavors.  I want to start by saying how excited I am to join the Xylem team. I have long admired the company, both because of its rise to sector leadership and also because of its distinctive commitment to both social and economic value creation. And now, a month in, I'm even more compelled by the opportunities ahead of us. It is a privilege to be part of the team that will take Xylem forward, building on this extraordinary platform and performance. As Patrick mentioned, we are increasing our full-year revenue EBITDA margin and EPS guidance. Full-year revenue will now be approximately $7.3 billion. This translates to total revenue growth of about 32% and organic revenue growth of about 11%, up from 9% to 10% previously.  We are raising EBITDA margin to approximately 19%, up from 18%, driven by higher volume, stronger price realization, and productivity initiatives. This reflects about 200 basis points of margin expansion versus the prior year. In addition, we are lifting full-year adjusted EPS guidance to $3.71 to $3.73, up from $3.60 at the midpoint.  The revised guidance breaks down by segment as follows: Low 20s growth in M&CS, up from approximately 20% previously, high single-digit growth in water infrastructure, and mid-single digit growth in Applied Water. And we remain committed to achieving free cash flow conversion of above 100% of net income. We have also provided you with a number of full-year assumptions in the appendix on slide 19.  And now, drilling down on the fourth quarter. We anticipate total revenue growth will be in the 35% to 36% range on a reported basis, and 4% to 5% organically. By segment, we expect revenue growth to be mid-teens in M&CS, low single digits in water infrastructure, and remain flat in Applied Water.  We expect fourth quarter EBITDA margin to be approximately 19.5%, driven by higher volumes, continued price realization, and productivity gains. This yields fourth quarter EPS of $0.94 to $0.96. Our operational discipline, commercial momentum, and backlog strength give us confidence to the remainder of the year in delivering our long-term plan.  With that, please turn to slide 15, and I'll turn the call back over to Patrick for closing comments. Appreciate it, Deane. Thanks Nathan. Yeah, no, a great question. And the team had already started that initiative before I got here. They recognize that it's a core tool that ultimately frees up organizational capacity, right. Its focus is to eliminate complexity, focus on the things that matter most. There's obviously the core analytics from a product and customer perspective, but thinking about more broadly and then leveraging those tools to help enhance our strategy.

            "name": "Patrick Decker",
            "content": "Thanks, Andrea. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. By now you'll have seen that our first full quarter as a combined company was Xylem and Evoqua together. The team delivered very strong performance across each of our segments. We significantly exceeded expectations on organic revenue growth, EBITDA margin and earnings per share, and revenue grew 10% organically.  We expanded EBITDA margin well above prior year, and we delivered EPS of $0.99 to the quarter, which represents 14% growth year-over-year. Orders were up 3%, and more importantly, our backlogs continue to grow, especially in our M&CS and ISS segments. Total backlog is now $5.2 billion, and this sets us up for continued growth momentum and demonstrates the health of our key end markets.  So on the strength of this performance, we are raising our full year guidance. I want to personally give a big shout out to the team for their strong operational performance during a period of integrating two large enterprises. Instead of getting distracted, the team continued to focus on serving our customers and delivering on our commitments. The integration of Evoqua is well on track to deliver the cost synergies we promised.  It's those synergies that underwrote the transaction, but more importantly, it's the growth synergies that excite us the most. And our customers have already begun to experience the advantages of our combined capabilities.  Overall, the quarter's strong result, it reflects our continued momentum. And that puts me in a very privileged position on my last earnings call as CEO of Xylem. In September, we announced the planned succession of both me as CEO and Sandy as CFO.  Matthew Pine is going to lead Xylem as CEO beginning January 1. I'll remain on as an advisor through the end of March. I'd also like to formally welcome our new CFO, Bill Grogan who is on the call with us today. He's alongside Sandy Rowland. Bill took on the role of CFO on October 1, and it's been a real pleasure to welcome him to the team.  Now as Sandy was in the Chair through the end of September, she's going to cover the third quarter results, but that's not going to happen before I take the opportunity to thank her for her many significant contributions as Xylem. She's been a great partner and a great leader over the last few years with me and the team. We simply would not be where we are today without her many contributions. So now over to you Sandy. Thanks, Sandy. Today is the 12th Anniversary of Xylem's listing on the Newark Stock Exchange. And I think it's pretty fair to say that 12 years ago, water wasn't very widely recognized as an investable thesis. But since then, intensifying secular trends have made absolutely clear, the value of a platform of solutions to meet the global water challenges. In that time, Xylem has evolved in our composition, our scale, and our impact. But our investment thesis has remained constant. It's one that's focused on a multi-year runway of attractive organic growth with sustainable margin expansion and strong free cash flow conversion. And it's that financial strength and confidence that allows us to effectively deploy capital as we continue building a differentiated market-leading water solutions platform.  Under that thesis, we built a very durable business model. And Xylem colleagues and partners around the world are creating significant economic and social value as we serve our customers and communities around the world.  I am both proud of what we built so far, but also excited to see what Xylem is capable of becoming under Matthew's leadership. Matthew and I have worked side by side for the three and a half years. So this handover is progressing very smoothly. And I have total confidence he will lead this team to realize the full promise of our strategy and create an even greater impact and value in the years to come.  So now, over to you Matthew. Thanks, Bill, and thank you Matthew and Sandy. This is a bittersweet moment for me. I'm wrapping up my last earnings call with Xylem.  Leading and helping build this enterprise has been absolutely the greatest privilege of my career. I'm so proud of what the team has achieved in the past 10 years. Of the work that we've done alongside our partners, serving our customers and communities, and of the value we've created together. That said, it's clear to me personally, we are only just beginning to realize our full potential. Xylem is strongly positioned, our momentum is accelerating, and there has never been a greater need for solutions to the world's water challenges. It's incredibly gratifying to know that me, that my more than 22,000 Xylem colleagues and our partners are going to take the work of solving water forward under an exceptionally strong leadership team. We are poised to have an even greater impact and to create even more value in the many years to come.  On a final personal note to the many of you whose jobs include closely tracking and analyzing our business, I've come to know you quite well as you followed Xylem's growth. I admire and respect the work that you do. All the very best to each of you, and simply go keep making a difference.  Now, we're going to take your questions, and so operator, let's open it up for Q&A. Good morning. Thank you, Deane, and that means a lot coming from you. You've been here from the beginning. Deane, this is Patrick. Just to punctuate what Matthew had said, in that segment again, orders are only a function of when POs are placed. The key metric there is what's happening with backlog. And again, the backlog is very healthy, the deal pipeline is very healthy, and the win rate, especially in North America, is very impressive for AMI. Thanks, Deane. Hey, good morning. Thanks Mike. Yeah. Hey Mike, we don't do things orthodox here, so \u2013 but we do them the right way through, it's called succession planning. So thank you. Good morning, Scott. Thank you, Scott. Thank you. Hey Scott, I guess two weeks ago I was \u2013 two weeks ago I was there for a week and I spent time with our leadership gang and the team and visited our locations in Nanjing, Shenyang, Shanghai, traveled around, met with customers, met with the team, and the whole purpose was to really get a sense for kind of how things feel in China. And all I can say is based upon our portfolio, what we have there.  Yeah, there's some near term shifting to the right on when backlog gets converted on the utility side, but underlying demand is still very strong there. That market is very positive and as many of you've heard me say before, as my father said, every generation thinks theirs is the last. This is my third time talking about the future of China in terms of demand for water and environment, and things felt very, very good in terms of robust underlying demand. And I think Scott, I would just add that part of our innovation effort, because R&D is only one part of innovation, was through the partnerships that we have through academia, venture capital startups coming to us, and that's where I think the scale and platform of Xylem and our relationships will benefit what the legacy Evoqua business was looking to capture, around things like PFAS, but other treatment solutions facing our customers. Thanks Scott. Hey, good morning, Nate. Thank you. And Nate, I \u2013 Matthew, he led the effort on cultivating the Idrica opportunity over a number of years, and obviously he's been involved in cultivating the Evoqua opportunity over a few years. What I would just offer up here is, this has always been as we've said, about helping our customers turn the lights on, on their infrastructure to understand, have a better feel for what's going on in infrastructure, so that when they spend the next dollar of CapEx or OpEx, where best to spend it.  And I think the, the few opportunities that Matthew mentioned already, where it's the pull through, that is as much the opportunity as the initial services sell to the customer. Thank you. Hey. Good morning Joe. Thanks Joe. And I think \u2013 this is Patrick. Sorry, sorry, Joe. That's all right. I just add that I think the way I would encourage investors to look at this is we've spent the last decade building a platform that customers can access for their needs, which means growth. And when you've built that platform, then you have something to actually apply 80/20 to.  And so that's why right now is the perfect time for this combination to be coming together and Bill coming in with his toolkit. The team had already been working on this, but I think what he brings to the table is going to be incredibly valuable to the enterprise in terms of value creation. Andy, this is Patrick. Again, one thing I would offer to investors as you think about, I know we have some new entrants into the space. I think it's important that our investors understand that we've got the broadest water platform that's out there. And so I think drilling down into what percentage of our total revenue actually overlaps with some of our competitors that are out there is an important thing to pay attention to.  The treatment bidding pipeline as Matthew alluded to, is the single most important indicator as the health of the utilities over time. And that continues to be up, I think, mid to high single digits. So that's a reflection of what the underlying health of utilities are. And again, I just offer that as something for you all to focus on. Thank you. Well, thank you all. I mean it's been a great privilege to work with such an extraordinary set of colleagues and partners over the past nearly 10 years. I couldn't be more proud of where we are today and I'm looking forward to seeing all that Matthew, Bill and the team are going to do is they take Xylem into its next chapter. The work has never been more important as to what Xylem is doing and this company has never been better positioned to make a difference, as we're committed to doing with our customers and communities around the world. Again, I want to thank you everyone and all the very best to you and your families."

            "content": "Thank you, Patrick. I am grateful and energized at the prospect of building on Xylem's momentum and creating our next phase of growth and impact. I'm also deeply grateful for Patrick's passionate, visionary leadership. His legacy is Xylem's bright future, having put Xylem firmly on a path of continuing profitable growth.  The strength of our partnership is making it easy to deliver the continuity essential to all stakeholders in this handover as we approach the turn of the year. And as Patrick said, our thesis is constant, our strategy is sound, and we are committed to our long-range plan.  Our team is solving customers' greatest water challenges with the most advanced platform of solutions in the world. In a fragmented, complex market, that integrated offering is a distinctive, competitive advantage. The opportunity ahead of us is to make it easier for even more customers to access the full range of capabilities they need to solve their most critical water challenges. In the process, we'll grow our penetration, our profitability, our durability, and our impact. The team and I look forward to sharing more color about the next phase of our growth at an Investor Day in May next year.  We'll provide a further update on our combined company opportunity and long-range plan then. In the meantime, I'm pleased to share our nearer-term outlook. I'll provide a brief update on our Evoqua integration, and then a picture of what we expect in our end markets over the next period. And then finally, I'll ask Bill to provide guidance for the remainder of the year.  Moving to slide 12, as you can see, the integration of Evoqua has gained quick momentum, and the team has come together remarkably fast. There's great collaboration, and we have the benefit of bringing two highly complemented cultures with a similarly strong sense of purpose together.  We committed $140 million of cost synergies within three years, as well as exiting 2023 with a $40 million run rate. And as Patrick mentioned, that's well on track. But the rationale for the combination has always been about growth, the opportunity to create more value serving customers with our combined capabilities.  In utilities, we'll deepen our penetration, especially with the addition of Evoqua's applied product technology offerings through our water infrastructure segment. The combination allows us to provide even more comprehensive treatment solutions in both clean water and wastewater.  In industrial, we will scale our presence in attractive verticals with services offerings of ISS. We see long-term market expansion in growing verticals such as microelectronics, power, life sciences, and food and beverage. And geographically, we will scale Evoqua's products and solutions internationally, including the services business, by leveraging Xylem's global distribution platform.  Both Xylem and Evoqua were market leaders on their own, but together, we're in even a stronger position. We are already seeing the benefits of scale, reach and integrated offerings, and a robust pipeline of global opportunities, as well as the combined wins both teams are posting.  And as we integrate our two businesses even more deeply, we'll take advantage of the opportunity to optimize our portfolio for growth. That will include structuring our offerings in ways that are matched to how our end markets address water management. The job is to make it even simpler for them to access solutions they need, and we're already hearing how customers appreciate having fewer vendors to coordinate across multiple domains.  Now, let's turn to slide 13, and I'll cover the outlook for our end markets. Our outperformance in the first three quarters of the year provides great momentum to build on. I especially want to echo Patrick's shout out to all of our teams for delivering such a standout performance this year, and in the third quarter. It's that kind of commitment and discipline that demonstrates the team's ability to execute through a dynamic macroeconomic environment.  That said, we continue to take a balanced outlook and are monitoring signs of softness on a regional level, particularly in China, and some end markets addressed by our Applied Water Segment.  As a reminder, our 2023 outlook is expressed on an organic basis. At a high level, we anticipate that utilities demand will continue to be resilient, and industrial demand will provide steady growth. Utilities compromise approximately 45% of revenue. They continue to show healthy demand, and we continue to expect growth of mid-teens.  On the clean water side, we continue to see robust demand for our AMI solutions. On top of that, we're driving backlog execution on improved chip supply, and we're seeing even more traction on solution selling with our digital platform as customers increasingly value bundled offerings. We now anticipate growth of mid-20s up from low-20s previously.  On the wastewater side, OpEx is expected to remain resilient in developed markets, alongside steady CapEx spend across regions, underpinning demand. We expect to see high single-digit growth in wastewater overall.  Turning to industrial end market, which is about 45% of our revenue, we now expect global growth of high single digits up from mid-single digits. Developed markets continue to be resilient, although there are pockets of moderation in emerging markets.  Lastly, in building solutions, which is about 10% of our revenue, we continue to expect growth of mid-single digits, driven by steady replacement business, particularly in commercial applications.  Overall, the demand outlook continues to be positive despite some variability in macro indicators. While the organic view does not include Evoqua, the demand profile in ISS is resilient on a foundation of recurring revenues, further increasing the durability of our business.  Now, I have the pleasure of turning the call over to Bill for the first time to walk through our Q4 guidance. Yeah, thanks Deane for the question. Maybe I'll just start at a very high level and just talk about the guiding principles that Patrick really stated when we did the deal, which I think were really important to our execution.  The first was, we said we have to deliver on our \u201823 plans, and as you can see from Q3, really strong performance. As most of you know, that was the legacy Evoqua's business Q4 in this past fiscal calendar Q3. So great execution by the team, and I couldn't be happier.  The second, we need to make sure we deliver on the value capture of the cost and revenue synergies. And on what I would call the softer side, which is equally as important when you bring two companies together, is to make sure we get the right talent on the field or the pitch, if you will, and make sure we retain top talent. We've done a really nice job there.  And then lastly, bringing the best to both cultures together. So obviously the work's not done, but we're off to a good start, and those guiding principles have helped really get momentum in the business.  Just quickly on cost synergies, we're tracking at the $40 million exit rate that we talked about, and those three buckets of corporate costs, procurement, and footprint. But more so on the revenue synergies, which you're getting at Deane, the momentum is strong. We've just completed the APT integration into water infrastructure, which is really a milestone for us.  We've appointed regional synergy leads in each one of the regions to drive the value capture. The incentives are in place, and the training's ongoing, both for the sales team as well as the services organization.  The short term, as you talk about, really the short term we're focused on cross-selling our products into industrial and back into municipal. I think the services, which I'll touch on in a minute, has been the biggest surprise so far. Midterm, we're going to leverage the Xylem footprint in Europe to bring capital products to customers, to the Evoqua products that are international, and bringing those folks from the U.S. to international. And then lastly, long term we're moving our services internationally.  But I wanted to give you an example of an early synergy win. We have a power customer, it's an oil and gas \u2013 well, actually it's an oil and gas customer, where we do the process water for them. It's a build-on operate. We do not do the wastewater and they had their wastewater system go down and it was crippling their operations. So within really 48 hours, we were able to bring the legacy businesses together, both on the treatment side, as well as the pumping and transport of wastewater in that facility and keep them up and running, and also keep them away from having fines.  We've had several examples like that where we can bring a full solution to the customer with one phone call, and I think that's really important. So off to a great start. There's many examples like that, but we'll be able to give a lot more context as we roll into 2024. Yeah, I'll start with orders and I'll come back to chip supply. Although we were down 11%, backlog is up 11%, $2.3 billion in M&CS, book-to-bill ratio greater than one. Deane, the bid activity remains really strong in M&CS, especially metrology. Really the reason for the decline in orders in the quarter was more of a timing of the backlog conversion to orders.  As you know, a lot of the larger AMI deals, they sit in backlog for a period of time, anywhere from three to 12 months, while the utility is getting ready for the deployment. And when we receive the PO is when we book it as an order. So it's more of a timing issue, and that can be a little bit lumpy. But in general, we're really bullish on AMI adoption, and it's still fairly early innings.  On the chip supply, the original guide this year for the business was low teens. Now we're in the low 20s. So we've seen continual gradual chip improvement quarter-over-quarter. I think this quarter it came in a little faster than we had thought, and it can be lumpy. But really chip supply in Q3 was strong. We see that continued momentum into Q4, especially with our product redesigns. And then obviously we've got -- with the backlog, we have a lot of potential in \u201824 in M&CS. Thank you, Deane. No, it's a great question Mike. We're committed to both the legacy businesses, long-range plans that were presented back in \u201821. Just start right there and just get that out. And really we have great momentum heading into next year with the platform that's been built by the Evoqua, Xylem combination. If you look back over the past decade of Patrick's leadership, 50% of the company didn't exist six or seven short years ago, and we're really operating from a position of strength in terms of the platform that has been built. So that feels really good as a jump-off point.  I think if you kind of think about the macro drivers or favorable drivers, the secular trends continue to be strong, scarcity of water, aged infrastructure in developed markets, water quality is increasingly an issue, and as many of us have seen this year with flooding happening all over the world.  So those trends will continue and they'll continue to buoy the business. Government funding, we talk a lot about the funding. It's going to be a dimmer switch. It's going to come over a period of time. But the next six to seven years, we'll see continued trickle funding globally, not only in the US. I think the resiliency of our OpEx and utilities will continue to be a strong point. I think the ISS durable business model, with the combination coming together with 75% services and aftermarket, gives us a lot more diversity of cash flows as we move into \u201824. And then lastly, M&CS backlog, which we just talked about with the supply chain improvements, I think are all positives.  I think if I had to mention a few watch items, our more cyclical pieces of the portfolio with the end markets and applied water are definitely a watch item. There's pockets of industrial weakness. It's really niche when you think about Ag or marine, but they are very small pieces of our business. But in general, industrial has tended to hold up pretty well.  And then I think the last thing I'd mentioned is China, which I mentioned in the opening comments. Industrial has remained pretty resilient in China for us. It's been the utilities, but it's been more on just a push to the right more than anything in China, which we can talk a little bit more about that later, but that's kind of the insights that we give. Obviously in our February earnings call, we'll be able to give more color, but that's what I see right now. Yeah, this price cost in Q3, continue to be positive for Xylem. We're up 70 bips. We expect pricing to moderate in 2024 as we lap previous increases. I think \u201824 is going to fall more in line with historical trends, but in terms of M&CS, definitely price costs contributed to a little bit of the incrementals this quarter. But we feel really positive in a step up in Q4 and into \u201824, we've taken some pricing actions that will start to really materialize into \u201824. And in terms of the mix, it'll continue to be a little bit lumpy with energy, but we're working that backlog down and we expect that to normalize as we get into \u201824. Thank you. Good morning. Yeah, I think it's \u2013 yeah, in terms of China, yeah. The under \u2013 I'll just say, the underlying demand does remain fairly healthy. It's like I said, industrial has been more resilient than utilities, but with regard to utilities, it's a little bit of a mixed bag. It's really timing of funding, not only for CapEx, but also for OpEx as well.  And as we've seen in the treatment piece of our business, in China it's been actually a little bit more resilient than transport. Transport tends to be a bit more OpEx centric. So it's a little bit of a mixed bag, Scott, when it comes to the funding. It's both CapEx and OpEx. That's a great question. We haven't talked a lot about the R&D synergies, but for sure they are there. Let me first start out by Snehal Desai leading that team. And I'm actually here in DC today with his leadership team.  So he comes over from the legacy of Evoqua business. And yes, there is some overlap, especially when you think about the work that's being done in PFAS, both obviously the capture technologies there about the destruction and the sensing is really where the innovations required. And obviously one plus one can equal three there. We were both working on that to get \u2013 separately. But now together, we think we can get there more efficiently and in a more expedited fashion.  But in general, yes, there were different solutions that we were working on separately, that as we come together we can get leverage from that combined spend and really that effort. Thank you. Yeah, I think ex-China, emerging markets has been pretty resilient for us across all different end markets, Nate. I think with the exception would probably be a little bit of weakness in the Middle East and our applied water business. But in general, if you look at the other businesses, they've been really resilient outside of China. And it's helped kind of buoy the \u2013 a little bit of the tough push to the right that we've seen in China. That's across all different regions; Africa, Northern Asia, Southeast Asia, India and Australia, New Zealand. Yeah, no, it's been fabulous. Actually, it's exceeded our expectations. We've engaged over 200 customers globally, and it's \u2013 the thing I'm excited about, it's been really balanced across the globe, both the U.S., Europe, and emerging markets. We've got a tremendous pipeline built. We're working now on executing from orders to sales and deployment.  I did \u2013 if you remember, I highlighted \u2013 I'm going to highlight a couple of examples. One was in the U.S. in a southeastern city, a large city, we're able to cut what I'll say, land and expand. We took the platform, the digital platform and the utility to aggregate all their applications and then making it easy for them. Then we bolted on two of our own applications, which is recurring revenue. And then from there we picked up a $40 million AMI deal. So it's kind of land and expand, but it's also pulling through our products and solutions.  On the heels of that, we just also picked up in Europe from a large European utility, $20 million of treatment in metrology in southern Europe, the same situation. They have the platform implemented and we're able to leverage our relationship and pull through treatment and AMI solution.  So I've talked a lot about the platform being the consolidator of utilities information. We believe that's true, but the pull through we're getting and the relationships we're building allows us to bundle our offerings, and that's really exciting. Yeah, I think, but I think it's a good comment, because we do think the platform has scalability into the industrial and building services business. Obviously we're going to stay focused on utilities at first. So we stay focused and deliver, but it does have ability to expand into industrial. Thank you. Hey. Good morning, Joe. Yeah, the water infrastructure order rate? Yeah. It included a couple of big projects in custom pump. But in general, yeah, we're seeing good demand, resilient demand, both in developed markets and ex-China and emerging markets. So we feel pretty good and it's been pretty resilient. Thanks, Joe. Hey, good morning, Andy. Yeah, I would just maybe just specific to utilities and wastewater, I think, is the proxy for the question. Just a reminder that 50% of our revenue is outside the U.S. and 75% of that is OpEx, which can be a little bit different in terms of the mix. We're seeing continued resiliency in orders in developed markets leading the way with emerging markets kind of minus China, like I just said to Joe, contributing nicely.  With regard to CapEx, I'd point to our treatment orders, which are up 6% in Q3. And we have a healthy funnel and pipeline up 8%. We have been reaching out to customers, kind of qualitatively a cross section of customers across the globe, and specifically in the U.S. They don't really see a major funding shift in spending. Plus the addition of stimulus money that's going to trickle in over time, Andy, I think will also help kind of keep things stable.  But in general, we haven't we haven't really kind of seen anything that's alarming for us, it would be a watch item. Yeah. You know, Andy, within our applied water business, we don't have a tremendous amount of stocking. Again, it's if you kind of Resi commercial over the overall Xylem business, it's only 10%, but a lot of our orders Andy or configure to order engineer to order, so therefore for a specific job. Yes, we have book and ship. It's mainly in our Resi business and a little bit commercially and a lot of that has kind of worked itself out.  If you look at our compares on the Resi business, which makes up 3% of our business, we're up on a year-over-year basis and we've kind of hit the bottom when we're coming out of the downturn on Resi. But again, it's a small part of our portfolio. Thanks Andy."

Now please turn to Slide 4, and I'll turn the call over to our CEO, Patrick Decker.\nPatrick Decker: Thanks, Andrea, and good morning, everyone. Today is a significant milestone for Xylem as we have the pleasure to present the performance and outlook of quite a different company than just a quarter ago as we describe our ability to make an impact on the world as society deals with growing water challenges.  The combination of Xylem and Evoqua has already begun taking shape as an even stronger global platform that will have a profoundly positive impact on our customers and communities. We have a responsibility in front of us to help at exactly the moment when the world's water challenges are coming into more acute focus than ever. When we completed the acquisition in May, our capability to meet this moment expanded along with our opportunities for growth. Now, 10 weeks into the integration of these 2 great enterprises, we are even more confident about the value we will create with our combined company.  There are 3 things that underpin that confidence. First, the team is delivering impressive performance across both companies. I am so very proud of our team for staying focused on serving our customers at a potentially distracting time. Each team, both legacy Xylem and Evoqua turned in a quarter significantly exceeding expectations and giving us brisk momentum for the future.  Second, our early progress on integration has increased our confidence in the cost synergies we previously laid out and the growth synergies ahead of us. We have moved well forward on both sources of value. And third, as water challenges continue to intensify for our customers across many parts of our economy and society, they are seeking simpler, more affordable ways to tackle them.  While we are now even more strongly positioned to solve those needs and capture that demand with increased exposure to attractive, durable end markets. We'll come back at these bigger points in a few minutes, but I want to make sure we also give appropriate attention to the very strong quarter we just closed. As we shared in our press release this morning, we significantly exceeded expectations on revenue growth, margin and earnings per share. Organic revenue growth was 15%, with total reported revenue growth of 26%. EPS was up 32% and grew 28%, excluding the impact of the acquisition. And we delivered EBITDA margin well above our guide at more than 19%. It was driven by strong demand and the team's continued focus on pricing as well as ongoing continuous improvement aimed at simplifying how we serve our customers.  Organically, all segments contributed double-digit revenue growth in all end markets. And each of our regions grew, led by notably strong pace in the U.S. and a solid recovery in China. Our legacy backlog was up 7%. And then we added Evoqua's backlog of more than $1 billion, and the 2 together bring our total backlog to $5.3 billion.  Well, we have a lot to do with the integration of these 2 great companies. We have strong commercial momentum, which gives us the confidence to raise our guidance for the year. And again, I want to thank every one of our team members around the world and our partners for what they are doing every day to deliver real impact to our customers and our communities.  In a moment, we'll give more color on our outlook as well as detail on our end markets and regions. But first, I'm going to hand it over to Sandy to dig into the quarter's strong results.\nSandra Rowland: Thanks, Patrick. Please turn to Slide 5. Since this is the first time we are reporting as a combined company, I would like to walk you through how we will cover our performance. We now have 4 reporting segments: Evoqua's Applied Product Technologies business has been integrated into water infrastructure, immediately combining our 2 complementary treatment product businesses. Evoqua's Integrated Solutions & Services business, or ISS, is reported as its own segment, providing continued transparency on the segment's results.  Our other two segments, Measurement & Control Solutions and Applied Water are unchanged. Additionally, since this quarter includes about a month of Evoqua's results, we have laid out organic results compared to our previously shared expectations and broken out the impact of the acquisition. Unless otherwise stated, all growth rates shared are on an organic basis.  And lastly, we have reported EPS on an adjusted basis that adds back noncash purchase accounting intangible amortization from the Evoqua acquisition and Xylem's previous acquisitions. We have therefore recast 2022 amounts for comparison purposes. And now let's turn to Slide 6 for our quarter's results.  The team delivered strong performance, beating our expectations for both growth and margin expansion. Total revenues grew 26%, while organic revenue growth of 15% was led by double-digit growth in the U.S. and Western Europe and high single-digit growth in emerging markets. Each business exceeded our expectations, and we saw double-digit growth in all segments and end markets.  Utilities was up 17% due to robust demand and price realization in both M&CS and Water Infrastructure. Industrial grew 11% on strong price realization and demand across all regions. And lastly, building solutions, which includes commercial and residential grew 15%. Overall, demand remains resilient as demonstrated by our $5.3 billion backlog, up 7% organically, as Patrick highlighted, and now includes Evoqua. And while orders were down 2% on the quarter, book-to-bill continues to be above 1.  EBITDA margin was 19.1%, up 250 basis points from the prior year on higher volumes, productivity savings and favorable price cost dynamics. Excluding the impact of Evoqua, EBITDA margin was up 200 basis points, exceeding our previous expectations. Our EPS in the quarter was $0.98, up 32% year-over-year and up 28% excluding the impact of acquisitions. Please turn to Slide 7, and I'll review each segment's second quarter performance in a bit more detail.  M&CS revenue was up 21%, driven by improved chip supply as well as strong demand in pipeline assessment services. U.S. and Western Europe saw robust growth, and we continue to see favorable momentum in emerging markets. Orders grew 6% with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.2 and our backlog of $2.4 billion is up 17% versus the prior year, demonstrating continued strong demand for our AMI offerings.  EBITDA margin for the segment was up 590 basis points versus the prior year on strong incrementals. Volume conversion, price realization and productivity drove the expansion, more than offsetting inflation and unfavorable mix. And now let's turn to Slide 8, and I'll cover our Water Infrastructure business.  Water Infrastructure, which now includes Evoqua's Applied Product Technologies segment grew 20% on a reported basis and 13% organically. Growth was robust across the portfolio, with revenues up double digits in all end markets and applications. Developed markets saw particularly strong growth driven by OpEx demand, while emerging markets grew 7%, driven by Latin America and Asia Pacific.  Orders in the quarter were down 4% year-over-year, lapping prior year growth of over 20%, and book-to-bill was above 1. EBITDA margin for the segment was roughly flat year-over-year and up 20 basis points when excluding the contribution of Evoqua. Please turn to Slide 9 for an overview of Applied Water.  Applied Water revenues grew 12% on continued strong price realization and backlog execution. The U.S. and emerging markets grew double digits, while Western Europe grew mid-single digits. Industrial demand was both resilient in both Western Europe and emerging markets, particularly due to recovery in China. And while orders were down 6% in the quarter, our backlog continues to be elevated versus historical levels, and book-to-bill is 0.9.  Segment EBITDA margin was up 290 basis points in the quarter with continued strong price realization, coupled with productivity more than offsetting inflation. Please turn to Slide 10.  I'm very pleased to introduce Integrated Solutions & Services as our newest reporting segment. ISS is a leading North American water treatment solution and services provider that brings access to a durable and highly recurring revenue stream as well as a diverse and attractive industrial verticals. With approximately 75% recurring revenue, ISS is known for dependability and bringing mission-critical water treatment expertise to our customers.  Although we only reported ISS after our May 24 close, full quarter revenue was up 12%, driven by strong price realization and backlog execution. And orders grew 4% with a book-to-bill ratio above 1 due to broad-based demand across industrials and utilities. Backlog of nearly $1 billion to end the quarter, was up 15% year-over-year. And adjusted EBITDA margin post close was a solid at 24%. And now let's turn to Slide 11 for an overview of cash flows and the company's financial position.  After retiring over $600 million of debt in conjunction with the closing of Evoqua, our financial position remains robust as we exit the quarter with over $700 million in cash and available liquidity of $1.6 billion. Net debt-to-EBITDA leverage is 1.4x and in the second quarter, we had solid adjusted free cash flow conversion of 86%. Please turn to Slide 12, and I'll hand it back over to Patrick.\nPatrick Decker: Thanks, Sandy. Just a little more than 2 months post close, our excitement about the Evoqua acquisition has only grown. We've made great progress in 3 areas. First is our performance and outlook as the business stands today. We began the integration with an overarching principle, and that was to deliver continuity for our customers, keep our commitments and not disrupt business performance. The results tell a clear story of focused near-term delivery.  The combination of our team's disciplined execution and healthy underlying market demand has given us the confidence to raise our full year guide. But our current performance is, as you would expect, largely a reflection of our businesses as they are. What we're most excited about is our future potential and the opportunities ahead of us, which brings me to the second dimension on which our confidence is only growing.  When the transaction closed, we announced a combined leadership team. And frankly, I'm energized by the strong cultural fit the team has already been demonstrating and the early momentum we've created. We are well on track to deliver the cost synergies outlined when we announced the transaction. And as we progress through the integration, we have even more greater visibility of the operating efficiencies to be realized in coming quarters, along with the opportunity for significant further margin expansion.  At the same time, the whole strategic rationale of this combination has always been about further accelerating our profitable growth. And that's the third dimension I referred to in my opening comments. We are now even more strongly positioned in attractive, durable end markets with a significant component of recurring revenue streams.  Now that we have deeper insight into the intersection of our businesses and customers, we see those opportunities even more clearly.  So moving on to Slide 13. This is the right combination at the right time. Together, we have the strongest platform of capabilities to address customers' critical water challenges. Those needs are increasing, and we have the scale and reach now to deliver differentiated solutions globally. Our teams are already detailing how we will do that.  First, in utilities, we will deepen our penetration, especially with the addition of Evoqua's Applied Product Technologies to our Water Infrastructure offerings. In industrial, we'll use the power of our combined offering to scale our presence in attractive industrial end markets. And then we will expand our Services Solutions business by leveraging Xylem's well-established global distribution platform.  Now as many of you know, this combination delivers on part of the strategy we laid out back in our 2021 Investor Day, and that was to expand our capability and our presence in industrial end markets. Increasing industrial exposure reinforces the durability of our overall business model and gains us greater access to attractive customer sets for even faster long-term growth. The recurring revenues of ISS, which deliver consistent performance throughout economic cycles, it complements our M&CS and Water Infrastructure businesses, which also benefit from the resilience of utility spending.  We've already taken the first steps in offering our combined portfolio to light and general industry customers and we're already targeting attractive industrial verticals such as life sciences and microelectronics. Both have strong long-term outlooks that are driven by secular trends that align well with Xylem's existing business. We look forward to keeping you up to date with our integration progress on a regular basis and anticipate providing a longer-term growth outlook at an Investor Day likely to be scheduled in the first part of 2024.  Now with that, I'm going to hand it over to Matthew to say a bit more about our end market outlook.\nMatthew Pine: Thank you, Patrick. Turning to Slide 14. Before I cover our end market outlook for the year, I want to thank the team and our partners for a great quarter. Our continued outperformance and momentum give us confidence to deliver in 2023 and beyond. We have record backlogs and the value proposition of our differentiated portfolio in attractive end markets puts us in a strong position even in a potentially dynamic macroeconomic environment. We continue to take a balanced approach in our outlook and are monitoring leading indicators watching for signs of moderation. That said, we expect resilient demand in utilities and continued steady growth in industrial water applications.  And now I'll turn to our 2023 outlook by end market, which will be on an organic basis. Utilities, which is approximately 45% of our revenue continue to be healthy and we now expect growth of mid-teens, up from low teens. On the clean water side, we anticipate growth of low 20s, up from high teens previously due to robust demand for our AMI solutions, and backlog execution on improved chip supply. In addition, we are seeing great traction on solution selling with our digital platform and customers are increasingly interested in bundling offerings.  On the wastewater side, we continue to expect high single-digit growth, resilient OpEx in developed markets as well as continued CapEx spend in emerging markets will underpin demand.  Turning now to the industrial end market, which is 45% of our revenue, we expect steady global growth of mid-single digits, but are keeping a close watch for signs of moderation. We expect any softness from developed markets to be somewhat offset by growth in emerging markets including China, where industrial momentum has continued to outpace utilities.  Lastly, in building solutions, which is about 10% of our revenue, we expect growth of mid-single digits, driven by steady replacement business and backlog execution. The overall demand outlook remains healthy. And although we are not including Evoqua in our organic outlook, we expect the contribution of mission-critical solutions and services in attractive high-growth verticals such as life sciences and microelectronics to further increase the durability of our business. That outlook, combined with our operating discipline, commercial momentum and large backlogs gives us confidence for the rest of the year and beyond.  Now I'll turn it over to Sandy to walk you through the detail of our raised guidance.\nSandra Rowland: Thank you, Matthew. Turning to Slide 15. We are increasing our full year guidance across revenue, EBITDA and EPS and also incorporating Evoqua. I want to take a moment to walk you through the puts and takes of how we now see the full year.  We expect total revenues to be around $7.2 billion for the year, which includes approximately $1.1 billion from Evoqua and another increase in our organic revenue guidance. We now expect full year organic revenue growth of 9% to 10%, up from 8% to 9%. We are raising the low end of our EBITDA guidance to about 18%. And in addition, we are lifting full year adjusted EPS guidance to $3.50 to $3.70, up approximately $0.35 at the midpoint. This incorporates a $0.15 raise from our strong organic outlook and a $0.20 increase due to acquisition-related adjustments. This includes a contribution from Evoqua of approximately $0.45 and the add back of legacy purchase accounting intangible amortization of $0.30 and partially offset by incremental share dilution of about $0.55.  As Patrick highlighted, we've made great progress on integration. We expect to be at $40 million of run rate cost synergies by the end of the year and we remain on track to deliver $140 million of run rate cost synergies within 3 years.  Turning to Slide 16. For 2023, our organic revenue growth by segment breaks down as follows: approximately 20% growth in M&CS, high single-digits growth in Water Infrastructure and mid-single-digit growth in Applied Water and we are still on track to achieve free cash flow conversion of at least 100% of net income.  We've also provided you with a number of other full year assumptions in the appendix on Slide 21. And now drilling down in the third quarter, we anticipate total company growth will be in the range of 40% to 45% on a reported basis and 4% to 6% organically.  By segment, we expect revenue growth to be in the high teens in M&CS and mid-single digits in Water Infrastructure and remained flat in Applied Water. We expect third quarter EBITDA margin to be approximately 18%, driven by higher volumes, continued price realization and productivity gains. And with that, please turn to Slide 17, and I'll turn the call back over to Patrick for closing comments.\nPatrick Decker: Thanks, Sandy. We've covered a lot here. So we look forward to your questions. But just before we do that, I want to reiterate a fundamental point. This is a transformational step forward for Xylem, and we believe it is transformational for our customers and our communities. We are very excited about this strategic evolution, but the most important things about Xylem are not changing.  Our investment thesis is one of those unchanging constants. We are creating significant economic and social value with a durable business model that addresses intensifying water challenges. And we're doing that with a differentiated portfolio of solutions and services in attractive and growing end markets. This gives us a multiyear runway of profitable growth with sustainable margin expansion on the foundations of a strong balance sheet and cash generation with capital deployment to further strengthen our portfolio.  It has become increasingly apparent that the need for solutions to the world's water challenges is only growing, and we are in a very privileged position to serve those needs. So now we look forward to taking your questions. So operator, let me turn the call back over to you for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is coming from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.\nDeane Dray: Just a comment to start, and we really appreciate all the heavy lifting that went on, all these moving parts, recasting financials, the re-segmentation, the new end market mix and the move to cash EPS. And look, from our perspective, that all makes sense, but we appreciate all the work that...\nPatrick Decker: Deane, before your question, I just want to -- I do want to give a shout out to the entire team here and around the world that have been a part of not just closing this transaction, but all the moving parts and pieces that you talked about. In the midst of exciting momentum, a lot of work, and we really appreciate that recognition.\nDeane Dray: Yes. That's exactly what I was doing. And just the fact you did not skip a beat on the organic side of the business. Cash conversion, order intake and so forth. So that was the comment part. And now I go to my question. On the re-segmentation, ISS is a stand-alone check the box. That's what we'd expect you to do. And then combining APT with Water Infrastructure that also makes sense because that's where there's some interesting overlap in terms of go-to-market, customer, not so much on the technologies, but on the go-to-market side.  So first question, because that is where there's some integration that will be going on. So give us a sense of what that integration effort is on combining those businesses and anything about the cost synergies and any conceptual thoughts on revenue synergies?\nPatrick Decker: Yes. Thanks, Deane. So I'm going to hand it to Matthew to comment on your specific question. I would say that the integration efforts are really off to a great start. And APT, that part of Evoqua is a clear and obvious opportunity for us, and I've been really pleased and impressed by the cultural assimilation of the teams. But with that, I'll let Matthew comment a bit more on why that integration, why now and what that kind of looks like for us.\nMatthew Pine: Thanks, Patrick. Deane, first of all, as Sandy mentioned a few minutes ago in her remarks, they're very complementary businesses, first and foremost. And there is immediate synergies, both on the revenue and the cost side. So that's getting us out of the gate fast. The teams are making great progress, as Patrick mentioned. It allows us to quickly cross-sell our products, both in industrial and utilities. And an example of this would be in the utility space, being able to bundle our solutions and kind of walk through the front door with a total solution across the whole treatment train, if you will, from beginning to end. We didn't have that capability before. Bringing the 2 companies together enables us to bring that full offering to the table.  Also, something that maybe is not as intuitive is our technicians, what we call AQUApros, are out with our customers. Now they have a broader portfolio to solve customer pain points. And we're already seeing that play out just organically with our technicians recommending other -- recommending new products in the portfolio very quickly. So that may be something that's not as intuitive, but it's happening already.  I'd say thirdly, I'd say the R&D synergies. There's obviously R&D synergies when we bring the treatment businesses together. And then lastly, we -- Patrick mentioned leadership in the very beginning. We brought over 3 leaders to the senior leadership team from Evoqua. Herv\u00e9 Fages will lead the combined treatment business. He has tremendous experience here and bringing those two pieces together will be instrumental for our out-of-the-gate performance on cost and revenue.\nDeane Dray: That's all really good to hear. And so second question is, the theme is digital. And first, just give us an update on the chip supply. Does it continue to be a gradual supply improvement there? And what's the outlook and then related to that is, Patrick, there's been this digital path for Xylem, where you were targeting a 50% of revenues by 2025. And I know it's still early, and I'm not asking a real specific number here, but just conceptually, how -- and our view is Evoqua is significantly on the path of digital themselves. So now combined, that should help you towards this goal. So just chip supply and then conceptually, where are you on the path on half of digital revenues by what timeframe?\nPatrick Decker: I'll let Matthew start on where we are on chip supply and then he and I will tag team on where we are in digital.\nMatthew Pine: Great. Chip supply, Deane, as you mentioned, is continuing to the moderate improvement as we expected. Q3 will look a lot like Q2. We do expect a pickup in Q4 and also as we head into 2024, we do expect chip supply to improve, but also our redesigns will be coming online as we head into the really the end of 2023 into 2024. So that gives us confidence that we'll see that ramp Q4 and then into '24.  Maybe just a few comments on digital and then Patrick can wrap it up. We are making good progress towards the 50% of revenues digital goal. That was a legacy Xylem target. We can see it in the backlog. We have a lot of digital content that's trapped in the backlog. And that will start to release as we get better chip supply and we get better, just in general electronic supply over the course of the next 6 to 12 months. The continued adoption of AMI, as you see in the backlog increase this quarter with M&CS, we're up $300 million. So making significant progress on digital, especially buoyed by AMI.  And then I'd say, lastly, the partnership with Idrica is really important because it enables us to pull through more digital content. We're already starting to see that play out. So I'd say, all in all, we're in a good trajectory, and we're making good progress.\nPatrick Decker: Yes. And I just -- I would wrap that up, Deane, with -- first of all, great question because it's a key underpinning of our overall story and differentiation in the marketplace, which is I know why you raised the question.  So high confidence in both the heritage kind of Xylem business. I would say what I'm most encouraged by there also is we continue to see really exciting adoption on AMI in the marketplace, which really is borne out by the print in our increased backlog and deal wins.  With Evoqua, the opportunity there, it really is more of a complementary strategy on digital. In the Evoqua businesses, we're really talking about the ISS business. The digital path that the team there has been on is really more around how do you use digital and connectivity to actually improve the productivity of the services offering making it easier for AQUApros to do their jobs. That leads to margin enhancement. That's a big opportunity within the ISS portfolio to improve our EBITDA margins by, again, digitally enabling kind of what they do every day, making less truck rolls, less visits to serve the customer, give the customer more data insights, predict where the issues are, before they have to go out and find them.  So there's a whole exciting area there that for those that are new to either the Xylem or the Evoqua story, we'll have more to share on that at our Investor Day going forward. It's very exciting.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Mike Halloran with Baird.\nMichael Halloran: So the first question, I think, is a relatively straightforward question, but I just want to level set everything, given how many moving pieces here that there are. So it sounds like guidance was raised both organically as well as your expectations that have moved higher on the Evoqua piece if we compare this to, call it, 2, 3 months ago, whenever you last gave an update. Can you just talk through the pieces of why that those expectations have moved higher? I know some of it is the second quarter outlook, but it feels like that it's a little broader than that. So can you just maybe line out those moving pieces for us?\nSandra Rowland: Yes. Let me take a crack at that, Mike. If you rewind back to February, we -- if you look at where -- compared to our initial guide, organically, we're now forecasting about $300 million higher revenue. We did raise our guidance the last time we spoke and this quarter we raised it by another $75 million.  In M&CS, we started the year thinking that the business would grow somewhere in the low teens. We now are expecting 20% growth in that segment. And we're seeing very good strong incremental margins come from that business. So it's a combination of metrology. It's also a combination of the other businesses that we wrap around metrology and M&CS that's giving us good upside. And then the other 2 businesses, they've been performing really well. They've gotten ahead of the curve from a price cost perspective we sustain that momentum. But I think what's also encouraging is we're seeing significant -- we're seeing more increases on the volume side as well. And so it's really all parts of our portfolio that are contributing to the beat and raise.  When I look at the Evoqua side of the house, we talked about them contributing about $1.1 billion this year. This past quarter, we brought in about $175 million of revenue from Evoqua. Margins there are developing really nicely and if you look at our implied outlook for the rest of the year, there -- the margins for both companies are really right on top of each other. So it's really good to see strong momentum from both sides of the house. And I think it goes back to the deal operating principles where we've kept both teams really focused on delivering on the organic plan.\nMichael Halloran: Great. No, that's exactly what I was looking for. Appreciate that. And then second question, maybe you could just talk a little bit about the momentum you're seeing on the utility side as we work through next year. Book-to-bill seems pretty good on the utility pieces. Obviously, M&CS is healthy. I think the infrastructure piece is healthy, though, obviously, you got some industrial in there. Backlog is very high on the M&CS side. Maybe just talk about the visibility you have on those pieces in the next year, wrapping ISS into that a little bit as well, and talk about how you're looking at the contribution from some of these regulatory drivers coming out of some of the funding that might or might not get released here?\nPatrick Decker: Yes. So I'll start, Mike, and then I'll hand it over to Matthew. Just to your question, zooming out around utilities, we remain, I would say, more confident than ever around where utilities -- again, this is a global statement where utilities are in the cycle. One, we see here in the U.S. that while we're still early in the adoption of AMI, we continue to see an increased excitement around that. And that shows up in our bidding pipeline. It shows up in our deal wins. It shows up in our backlog. And I think the numbers speak for themselves there on where AMI adoption is going and our ability to successfully compete and win in that space of the market.  Secondly, the -- there are the underlying fundamentals of -- the largest part of utility spend, as you well know, is OpEx, it's repair replace. And given the age of infrastructure around the world, most notably here in North America but also in Europe. We see continued increases in that demand and outlook. And that's going to continue as a long-term trend.  I think in terms of other demand profiles beyond that, as we think about whether it be the Inflation Reduction Act, other infrastructure legislation here in the U.S. We get a lot of questions around PFAS and obviously, with our Evoqua capabilities coming in, that's obviously a very exciting area for us. But as we've said before, and I know Ron, the CEO of Evoqua in the past has said, that's a dimmer switch. It's not like all of a sudden one day it's going to show up. It's going to be adoption over time. And it just reinforces the positive tailwind that we believe we have in the areas that we're focusing on at Xylem.  So that's my commentary around utilities. I don't know, Matthew, if you want to add anything to that.\nMatthew Pine: I think the only thing I would add to that, we have really close relationship with our customers, especially our utility customers. And based on conversations that we've had with them over the past few months, we don't see a reason that there's going to be any slowdown. The draft muni budgets for the next year for some of our weather utilities are showing growth year-over-year. So I'd say kind of -- that's kind of customer back, the feedback we're getting. Obviously, we play very globally in utilities, not only in the U.S. but half of our revenue is outside the U.S. And to Patrick's point, there's a lot of public funding globally both in the U.K. with the AMP cycle. In China, the EU and then obviously, in the U.S. So feels pretty good.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Joe Giordano with TD Cowen.\nJoseph Giordano: Can you talk through like kind of how the quarter went in Western Europe and China? I mean that's where the debt has been kind of squishy and maybe getting work there a little bit. And I'm just curious on your thoughts on potential for Chinese stimulus and where that might get directed if it does impact you guys?\nMatthew Pine: Yes. Joe, it's Matthew. Just maybe just some comments on Europe. It continues to be resilient, especially in utilities, which is over 50% of our revenue in Europe. With the majority of that being in OpEx, as Patrick just mentioned earlier. We were up low teens in orders in Europe in utilities. And so that was really good news. The softness that we're seeing is more on the building solutions side, which is partially offset by industrial.  All in all, Western Europe is up low single digits in orders. So I'd say, all in all, faring pretty well there when you take the balance there in account.  China, which makes up around 6% of our revenues, we saw positive momentum both in orders and revenue in Q2. We were up 20% plus, which although it was an easier compare, it was really great work done by Shuping Lu, who leads our team there and the entire team in China. Just incredible resolve and just really in China for China, localizing products and shifting where some of the slowness is happening and getting into more of the high-growth areas.  Industrial has led the way in China for us, and we're starting to see a little bit of momentum in the utility space. And obviously, in the commercial building space in China, that's where the weakness is, but it's not a big part of our business in China. 75% of our business in China is more utility centric. So all in all, we're very confident in China, and we -- in the long-term outlook, given really the critical nature and focus on water in country there.\nPatrick Decker: And Joe, you know this already, but for the rest of the listeners, I've been a long-term bull on China just because of the underlying demands and needs from a water and environmental standpoint there continues to be a top policy mandate of the government. You couple that with the strength of our team and our portfolio of offerings. We've weathered a couple of cycles in China over the time that I've been here. But when you go back and look over the last 7 or so years, it's like a double-digit CAGR of growth, and we continue to see that potential going forward. So I'm very proud of the team and optimistic about China for us.\nJoseph Giordano: That's good color. And then just I wanted to follow up on Idrica. Just -- where is that in terms of like what needs to happen for that to become kind of like a core kind of beachhead for you and digitalization on a scale basis? And then, Sandy, I just had one clarification for you. APT within Water Infrastructure. Just curious how that looked organically on like a full quarter basis for revenue and orders?\nSandra Rowland: Yes, let me knock that out of the way and then Matthew can take Idrica. When you look at the performance of the full quarter of Evoqua, the business grew 9% organically and the APT piece of Evoqua grew 4%.\nMatthew Pine: Great. Yes. In terms of Idrica, just for folks that are on the phone that may not know what Idrica is, it's -- we have an exclusive commercial partnership worldwide with Idrica, which is headquartered in Valencia, Spain. They were born out of the utility operator and the digital platform that they have that we're partnered with, addresses really the biggest pain point we hear from utilities, need for a singular platform to seamlessly integrate all of their applications and data. And I would say we have built really good momentum over the past 4 to 5 months. We've engaged over 200-plus utilities globally, and it's got really global reach, it's fairly balanced across the globe and have built a solid funnel with really significant synergy wins through bundling our solutions.  So I would say it is becoming the beachhead. It will become the beachhead and earlier in Deane's question, is going to help us pull through and drive more digital content and also reoccurring revenue, which is really important.  Just one example I'll give you in the U.S. recently where we leveraged this digital platform, we're calling the Xylem View which is the Idrica platform. We pulled through a large AMI order. Now you're seeing in the backlog. So you saw the backlog grow by $300 million. One of those big synergy wins was due to the digital platform that we enabled and pull through this synergy order. So it's going to help us with recurring revenue, but it's also going to pull through content, which is really strong.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Nathan Jones with Stifel.\nNathan Jones: I'm going to start on the cost synergy side. Pretty good run rate to be at $40 million by the end of the year, like 30% of the targeted cost synergy number. So maybe you could just start off by talking about where that's coming from to hit that kind of run rate that quickly in this kind of deal, the major buckets for the $140 million? And then if you can give us any color on how we should think about those layering in, in '24, '25, '26?\nSandra Rowland: Yes. Sure, Nate. Let me kick that off. I think the cost synergy buckets that we outlined when we announced the transaction have not changed. So the first category was to go after a public company costs, overlapping public company costs as well as some of the SG&A savings. And so that is making up the lion's share of the savings that we're going to realize in 2023.  And the other two categories of savings, which are going to come from procurement savings as well as some site consolidations and manufacturing footprint overlap, we expect the procurement savings to start to kick in later in '24. And the manufacturing site consolidations, that's going to happen over time. We have those phased because we want to make sure we're purposely taking care of our customers.  So about $40 million exit rate in Q4 as I look into '24, we'll be more than double that when we exit '24. So I think all signs, we're very confident about the $140 million.\nNathan Jones: And I did want to ask a couple of questions or one probably long question about revenue synergies. It's obviously a big motivating factor for this deal to get done in the first place. Not looking for exact numbers. [indiscernible], more of those in early '24. But if you can just talk conceptually about areas where you see potential for revenue synergies and kind of the phasing of those. I mean, there's obviously the APT and Water Infrastructure combination, I think, certainly signals that there's revenue synergies there, and you talked about them before.  But maybe talking about things like expanding Evoqua's service-based business model internationally, maybe leveraging their footprint in the U.S. to develop some more service-based business models with Xylem's legacy products? And then any other channels you'd be willing to talk about to help us understand the opportunity here?\nPatrick Decker: Sure. So Nate, this is Patrick. So I go back to the 3 overarching kind of areas that we're focused on. And what I would offer is we've also got special incentives in place for our teams to go capture the revenue synergy because we want people to be highly motivated to go do these things beyond their day job.  So deep in our utility penetration. And that really is around, again, combination of our treatment product portfolio of the 2 companies. They really do complement each other very, very well and leveraging what Xylem's really market-leading utility position is around the world. These are not North America comments alone, they're around the world, is a big opportunity.  Secondly, scaling our offering to industrial customers. Again, we call them industrial, and there's a number of customer sets that are in that area that we think there are big opportunities. We don't think we see big opportunities to really go solve their needs. So if you think about -- well, the third is expanding the ISS offering internationally.  And 2 and 3 have a lot in common because as part of our diligence when we looked at Evoqua, they have a really, really impressive roster of customers market-leading customers that cut across areas of whether it be power, whether it be food and beverage, whether it be life science, whether -- again, whether it be microelectronics that have needed even more Evoqua's capability than Evoqua has been able to provide in the past, especially international. And that's where we, as Xylem, have the footprint and we had the scale and the resources to be able to drive that adoption.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Joe Giordano with Jefferies.\nSandra Rowland: Operator, I think we've heard from him.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Saree Boroditsky with Jefferies.\nSaree Boroditsky: Maybe digging into building solutions a little bit. Commercial demand has continued to be strong. I think this is one area that you're anticipating a slowdown previously. So maybe just an update on what you're seeing there.\nSandra Rowland: Yes. I mean -- I'm sorry, so it was a little bit choppy, you asked about commercial? Yes. So our commercial business has been pretty resilient this year. We've seen -- continue to see strong revenue growth. And our outlook for the back of the year is -- we still are going in with an elevated backlog. So nothing has changed materially there.\nPatrick Decker: Saree you were a bit choppy and breaking. I want to make sure we clarify your question in terms of which segment.\nSaree Boroditsky: Yes. I think you're anticipating a slowdown previously. I think said maybe . Just trying to get an update there on building solutions. And then maybe just on -- just following that up on residential, obviously, small market for you guys, but how did that trend through the quarter? And are you seeing any positive signs there?\nSandra Rowland: Yes. Saree, I mean, I think when you look across the portfolio, we're seeing really good orders momentum and strong book-to-bill. The one soft spot in our portfolio is residential. And before the acquisition, that made up about 5% of our revenue base. Now it's even lower than that. It's 2% or 3% of our revenue base. So yes, that is the weakest part of our portfolio. You're seeing a slower growth outlook in AWS for the second half of the year, offset by the other businesses that have more resilient end markets such as utilities.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: So Patrick, dewatering has obviously remained strong for you guys. We talked about it in the past being a little more cyclical, but it seems like it's sort of holding up well. So maybe you can talk about sort of what you see going forward, maybe even into '24 in that business.\nPatrick Decker: Yes. So dewatering had historically, for those that may be relatively new to the story of Xylem, had historically been one of our more cyclical businesses. And because it's such a high-margin business, it would tend to capture spotlight even with a little bit of movement in terms of downturn. And there have been a number of moves that we've made over the past handful of years to diversify the end market exposure of that.  I'll hand it over to Matthew to kind of give his take on kind of where we are positioned right now. But I'm certainly proud of the work the team has done. And there's been a lot of work done on synergy, commercial integration even before the acquisition of Evoqua and I know it's like stronger now.\nMatthew Pine: Yes. No, it's great, Patrick. We've put a lot of time and effort into dewatering over the past couple of years, Andy. And I would say maybe a couple of things. One is we invested in the fleet, both in Europe and in the U.S., which has really helped us capture more wins. Number two, really coming out of 2019, we needed to diversify our segments in dewatering. We were too oil and gas dependent. And we've done a nice job of mixing into light construction as well as into mini bypass and some different areas that are a bit more profitable and a bit more steady and less cyclical.  So those are a couple of key drivers, I would say that's really helped us. And the last thing I would say in the U.S. where predominantly our revenue is, we've done a good job of driving the businesses together and driving synergies with our service organizations, passing leads back and forth to one another, with our pipeline assessment service businesses, our valve maintenance business and whatnot. So really good on the synergy side that's helped drive growth as well.\nPatrick Decker: I would just wrap up that answer by saying, I think in this business, like the entire business but certainly in this area, it's about leadership. We've got a strong leadership team in that area that are working together. They're leveraging the portfolio. They're focusing on what happens at a slight kind of local service level. This, just like our ISS business coming in, it's people, very people-driven business. It's an emergency room kind of operation. it's what happens every day, 24/7. And so the hearts and minds of the people really, really matter here. They do everywhere, but they really matter here in terms of what customers experience in the moment. And again, I just give -- I give an applause to leadership team for what they've done.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Very helpful, guys. And I apologize, I joined the call a little late, so if this has been asked, but like on price versus cost, maybe talk about sort of -- you already talked about supply chain getting better, I think, but sort of what you're seeing on the pricing side versus that sort of improving supply chain? And then maybe looking at Evoqua too, any sort of differences in markets as you're thinking about price versus cost as you go to the second half of this year and into '24.\nSandra Rowland: Yes. Thanks for the question, Andy. We've seen really nice development on the price cost side, and it continues -- the way we've managed it, it's now been a tailwind for us from a margin perspective. We are starting to anniversary some of the price increases that we took when inflation was peaking. And so you're not going to see as much of a tailwind from price in the back half of the year that you saw in the front half.  The positive thing is that this is actually the first quarter that we've seen inflation start to moderate and come through our results. And we would expect to see a little more of that as well in the back half of the year. So really great work by the commercial teams to make that happen over the past year.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Brian Lee with Goldman Sachs.\nBrian Lee: A question on the M&CS margins. Kudos on super solid execution there. I don't think we've seen margins at these levels since I think right after you bought Sensus, so it's been a while. So just trying to get a better sense of what drove that, how sustainable it is? And then what we maybe should be thinking of run rates through year-end. And if you think this is a good sort of jumping off point for potentially getting back to a double-digit margin on a full year basis next year. Is that a reasonable sort of target to have at this point?\nMatthew Pine: Yes. Thanks for the question. I'll start us out and then turn it over to Sandy. But we've spent a lot of time in the past 6 to 12 months, really, the past 12 months on M&CS margins. And I'd say there's probably 2 or 3 things I would point to. Number one, obviously, we were hampered by chip supply, not being able to unlock the backlog. And so being able to unlock the backlog is really helped with absorption in our factories and helping cover fixed costs. So that's probably number one.  Number two is we're getting back to productivity in that business. We had to redeploy resources to go after redesign our products for chips. And so productivity has increased this year year-over-year, and we'll continue to drive that in the business.  And then thirdly, I would just say, in general, price cost has been a very good positive over the past 2 to 3 quarters in M&CS, which has helped buoy margins as well. So we'll continue that pace going forward and expect margin improvement sequentially going forward.\nPatrick Decker: And Brian, this is Patrick. I would just offer up some historical perspective here for those that may be early on in the story here. M&CS is not a turnaround. We -- I mean, this has been an issue in terms of being able to deliver on what has been an impressively growing backlog over the course of the past few years. And we've had margin read-through on what that backlog is for a long time. We've made commitments in the past as to when we reach certain levels of revenue, what the margins would be, that's exactly what you're seeing right now.  So again, I give a shout out to the entire team that drives, especially the metrology part of our business because they've been executing on this ever since we did the acquisition. It's just -- it's always been something along the way. And now we're seeing that the clouds have kind of moved off the horizon and you're now seeing what the full potential or at least the next stage of potential is for this part of our business.\nBrian Lee: Okay. That's great. I appreciate that color. And then maybe just a second question around -- with the acquisition of Evoqua, clearly much bigger scale, but much more diversification across the business model. It seems like it'd be a lot less cyclical going forward. In the past, I know Evoqua has sort of broken out what the sort of their recurring revenue exposure is as a part of their portfolio or sales mix. Now on the combined entity, any sense you can give us as to how you think about the recurring revenue nature of the different segments where you have exposure there and kind of how that compares to Xylem stand-alone?\nPatrick Decker: Yes. No, certainly, great question, Brian. I mean it was certainly not the reason for the acquisition, but certainly, one of the big benefits is that recurring revenue component. The Evoqua business, we have tremendous line of sight going into any given year based upon contractual commitments as to what that looks like. And so you're talking about the largest portion of their revenue is predictable and repeatable going into the year. And so -- and that really is ISS, which is obviously the largest part of what we got from Evoqua.  If you look at the other parts of our business, historically, our M&CS business, which is metrology, also has a lot of revenue under contract. And so a majority of revenue there is visible going into the year, but not even one year. It's looking at it over the course of a 10- to 12-year time frame, given AMI deals that are there. Water Infrastructure would be the next one, given the fact that we've got such a large installed base of our particularly submersible wastewater pumps, but also our treatment products that we do that are typically long-term kind of projects that we're operating under. And it's just a very stable repair replacement environment. We feel very good about that.  The area -- the business that's always been shorter cycle for us is our Applied Water business. But even there, we would say upwards of 1/3 to 40% of our revenue, while it's not under contract, it's a replacement model. And once you've spec your pumps into a commercial building, or an industrial application, the likelihood of a customer changing out to a new supplier is very low. It's very sticky, and we have market-leading positions there. So even though it's not contractual, we can kind of have that visibility going into the year.  So we will -- in the future, we'll give you specific numbers in the aggregate. I don't want to overcommit to that right now, but we feel very good about the durability and nature of recurring revenue of this business much more now than we did a quarter ago because of bringing in Evoqua.\nOperator: This concludes the Q&A portion of today's call. I would now like to turn the floor over to Patrick Decker for closing remarks.\nPatrick Decker: Well, again, I mean, thanks to all of you for your time this morning and for your ongoing support. I look forward to seeing many of you over the coming months here before our next call. And just a reminder, lastly, again, really excited today about the power of the combination of 2 companies coming together that were strong on their own and performing well. And now is the time. It's the right time in this world for these 2 companies to come together because there are so many great water challenges out there to be dealt with, and we feel that we are in a position to really be a meaningful part of that. So thank you all very much.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's Xylem Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Please disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day.",

            "content": "Thanks, Patrick. Please turn to Slide 5. Since this is the first time we are reporting as a combined company, I would like to walk you through how we will cover our performance. We now have 4 reporting segments: Evoqua's Applied Product Technologies business has been integrated into water infrastructure, immediately combining our 2 complementary treatment product businesses. Evoqua's Integrated Solutions & Services business, or ISS, is reported as its own segment, providing continued transparency on the segment's results.  Our other two segments, Measurement & Control Solutions and Applied Water are unchanged. Additionally, since this quarter includes about a month of Evoqua's results, we have laid out organic results compared to our previously shared expectations and broken out the impact of the acquisition. Unless otherwise stated, all growth rates shared are on an organic basis.  And lastly, we have reported EPS on an adjusted basis that adds back noncash purchase accounting intangible amortization from the Evoqua acquisition and Xylem's previous acquisitions. We have therefore recast 2022 amounts for comparison purposes. And now let's turn to Slide 6 for our quarter's results.  The team delivered strong performance, beating our expectations for both growth and margin expansion. Total revenues grew 26%, while organic revenue growth of 15% was led by double-digit growth in the U.S. and Western Europe and high single-digit growth in emerging markets. Each business exceeded our expectations, and we saw double-digit growth in all segments and end markets.  Utilities was up 17% due to robust demand and price realization in both M&CS and Water Infrastructure. Industrial grew 11% on strong price realization and demand across all regions. And lastly, building solutions, which includes commercial and residential grew 15%. Overall, demand remains resilient as demonstrated by our $5.3 billion backlog, up 7% organically, as Patrick highlighted, and now includes Evoqua. And while orders were down 2% on the quarter, book-to-bill continues to be above 1.  EBITDA margin was 19.1%, up 250 basis points from the prior year on higher volumes, productivity savings and favorable price cost dynamics. Excluding the impact of Evoqua, EBITDA margin was up 200 basis points, exceeding our previous expectations. Our EPS in the quarter was $0.98, up 32% year-over-year and up 28% excluding the impact of acquisitions. Please turn to Slide 7, and I'll review each segment's second quarter performance in a bit more detail.  M&CS revenue was up 21%, driven by improved chip supply as well as strong demand in pipeline assessment services. U.S. and Western Europe saw robust growth, and we continue to see favorable momentum in emerging markets. Orders grew 6% with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.2 and our backlog of $2.4 billion is up 17% versus the prior year, demonstrating continued strong demand for our AMI offerings.  EBITDA margin for the segment was up 590 basis points versus the prior year on strong incrementals. Volume conversion, price realization and productivity drove the expansion, more than offsetting inflation and unfavorable mix. And now let's turn to Slide 8, and I'll cover our Water Infrastructure business.  Water Infrastructure, which now includes Evoqua's Applied Product Technologies segment grew 20% on a reported basis and 13% organically. Growth was robust across the portfolio, with revenues up double digits in all end markets and applications. Developed markets saw particularly strong growth driven by OpEx demand, while emerging markets grew 7%, driven by Latin America and Asia Pacific.  Orders in the quarter were down 4% year-over-year, lapping prior year growth of over 20%, and book-to-bill was above 1. EBITDA margin for the segment was roughly flat year-over-year and up 20 basis points when excluding the contribution of Evoqua. Please turn to Slide 9 for an overview of Applied Water.  Applied Water revenues grew 12% on continued strong price realization and backlog execution. The U.S. and emerging markets grew double digits, while Western Europe grew mid-single digits. Industrial demand was both resilient in both Western Europe and emerging markets, particularly due to recovery in China. And while orders were down 6% in the quarter, our backlog continues to be elevated versus historical levels, and book-to-bill is 0.9.  Segment EBITDA margin was up 290 basis points in the quarter with continued strong price realization, coupled with productivity more than offsetting inflation. Please turn to Slide 10.  I'm very pleased to introduce Integrated Solutions & Services as our newest reporting segment. ISS is a leading North American water treatment solution and services provider that brings access to a durable and highly recurring revenue stream as well as a diverse and attractive industrial verticals. With approximately 75% recurring revenue, ISS is known for dependability and bringing mission-critical water treatment expertise to our customers.  Although we only reported ISS after our May 24 close, full quarter revenue was up 12%, driven by strong price realization and backlog execution. And orders grew 4% with a book-to-bill ratio above 1 due to broad-based demand across industrials and utilities. Backlog of nearly $1 billion to end the quarter, was up 15% year-over-year. And adjusted EBITDA margin post close was a solid at 24%. And now let's turn to Slide 11 for an overview of cash flows and the company's financial position.  After retiring over $600 million of debt in conjunction with the closing of Evoqua, our financial position remains robust as we exit the quarter with over $700 million in cash and available liquidity of $1.6 billion. Net debt-to-EBITDA leverage is 1.4x and in the second quarter, we had solid adjusted free cash flow conversion of 86%. Please turn to Slide 12, and I'll hand it back over to Patrick. Thank you, Matthew. Turning to Slide 15. We are increasing our full year guidance across revenue, EBITDA and EPS and also incorporating Evoqua. I want to take a moment to walk you through the puts and takes of how we now see the full year.  We expect total revenues to be around $7.2 billion for the year, which includes approximately $1.1 billion from Evoqua and another increase in our organic revenue guidance. We now expect full year organic revenue growth of 9% to 10%, up from 8% to 9%. We are raising the low end of our EBITDA guidance to about 18%. And in addition, we are lifting full year adjusted EPS guidance to $3.50 to $3.70, up approximately $0.35 at the midpoint. This incorporates a $0.15 raise from our strong organic outlook and a $0.20 increase due to acquisition-related adjustments. This includes a contribution from Evoqua of approximately $0.45 and the add back of legacy purchase accounting intangible amortization of $0.30 and partially offset by incremental share dilution of about $0.55.  As Patrick highlighted, we've made great progress on integration. We expect to be at $40 million of run rate cost synergies by the end of the year and we remain on track to deliver $140 million of run rate cost synergies within 3 years.  Turning to Slide 16. For 2023, our organic revenue growth by segment breaks down as follows: approximately 20% growth in M&CS, high single-digits growth in Water Infrastructure and mid-single-digit growth in Applied Water and we are still on track to achieve free cash flow conversion of at least 100% of net income.  We've also provided you with a number of other full year assumptions in the appendix on Slide 21. And now drilling down in the third quarter, we anticipate total company growth will be in the range of 40% to 45% on a reported basis and 4% to 6% organically.  By segment, we expect revenue growth to be in the high teens in M&CS and mid-single digits in Water Infrastructure and remained flat in Applied Water. We expect third quarter EBITDA margin to be approximately 18%, driven by higher volumes, continued price realization and productivity gains. And with that, please turn to Slide 17, and I'll turn the call back over to Patrick for closing comments. Yes. Let me take a crack at that, Mike. If you rewind back to February, we -- if you look at where -- compared to our initial guide, organically, we're now forecasting about $300 million higher revenue. We did raise our guidance the last time we spoke and this quarter we raised it by another $75 million.  In M&CS, we started the year thinking that the business would grow somewhere in the low teens. We now are expecting 20% growth in that segment. And we're seeing very good strong incremental margins come from that business. So it's a combination of metrology. It's also a combination of the other businesses that we wrap around metrology and M&CS that's giving us good upside. And then the other 2 businesses, they've been performing really well. They've gotten ahead of the curve from a price cost perspective we sustain that momentum. But I think what's also encouraging is we're seeing significant -- we're seeing more increases on the volume side as well. And so it's really all parts of our portfolio that are contributing to the beat and raise.  When I look at the Evoqua side of the house, we talked about them contributing about $1.1 billion this year. This past quarter, we brought in about $175 million of revenue from Evoqua. Margins there are developing really nicely and if you look at our implied outlook for the rest of the year, there -- the margins for both companies are really right on top of each other. So it's really good to see strong momentum from both sides of the house. And I think it goes back to the deal operating principles where we've kept both teams really focused on delivering on the organic plan. Yes, let me knock that out of the way and then Matthew can take Idrica. When you look at the performance of the full quarter of Evoqua, the business grew 9% organically and the APT piece of Evoqua grew 4%. Yes. Sure, Nate. Let me kick that off. I think the cost synergy buckets that we outlined when we announced the transaction have not changed. So the first category was to go after a public company costs, overlapping public company costs as well as some of the SG&A savings. And so that is making up the lion's share of the savings that we're going to realize in 2023.  And the other two categories of savings, which are going to come from procurement savings as well as some site consolidations and manufacturing footprint overlap, we expect the procurement savings to start to kick in later in '24. And the manufacturing site consolidations, that's going to happen over time. We have those phased because we want to make sure we're purposely taking care of our customers.  So about $40 million exit rate in Q4 as I look into '24, we'll be more than double that when we exit '24. So I think all signs, we're very confident about the $140 million. Operator, I think we've heard from him. Yes. I mean -- I'm sorry, so it was a little bit choppy, you asked about commercial? Yes. So our commercial business has been pretty resilient this year. We've seen -- continue to see strong revenue growth. And our outlook for the back of the year is -- we still are going in with an elevated backlog. So nothing has changed materially there. Yes. Saree, I mean, I think when you look across the portfolio, we're seeing really good orders momentum and strong book-to-bill. The one soft spot in our portfolio is residential. And before the acquisition, that made up about 5% of our revenue base. Now it's even lower than that. It's 2% or 3% of our revenue base. So yes, that is the weakest part of our portfolio. You're seeing a slower growth outlook in AWS for the second half of the year, offset by the other businesses that have more resilient end markets such as utilities. Yes. Thanks for the question, Andy. We've seen really nice development on the price cost side, and it continues -- the way we've managed it, it's now been a tailwind for us from a margin perspective. We are starting to anniversary some of the price increases that we took when inflation was peaking. And so you're not going to see as much of a tailwind from price in the back half of the year that you saw in the front half.  The positive thing is that this is actually the first quarter that we've seen inflation start to moderate and come through our results. And we would expect to see a little more of that as well in the back half of the year. So really great work by the commercial teams to make that happen over the past year."

            "name": "Patrick Decker",
            "content": "Thanks, Andrea, and good morning, everyone. Today is a significant milestone for Xylem as we have the pleasure to present the performance and outlook of quite a different company than just a quarter ago as we describe our ability to make an impact on the world as society deals with growing water challenges.  The combination of Xylem and Evoqua has already begun taking shape as an even stronger global platform that will have a profoundly positive impact on our customers and communities. We have a responsibility in front of us to help at exactly the moment when the world's water challenges are coming into more acute focus than ever. When we completed the acquisition in May, our capability to meet this moment expanded along with our opportunities for growth. Now, 10 weeks into the integration of these 2 great enterprises, we are even more confident about the value we will create with our combined company.  There are 3 things that underpin that confidence. First, the team is delivering impressive performance across both companies. I am so very proud of our team for staying focused on serving our customers at a potentially distracting time. Each team, both legacy Xylem and Evoqua turned in a quarter significantly exceeding expectations and giving us brisk momentum for the future.  Second, our early progress on integration has increased our confidence in the cost synergies we previously laid out and the growth synergies ahead of us. We have moved well forward on both sources of value. And third, as water challenges continue to intensify for our customers across many parts of our economy and society, they are seeking simpler, more affordable ways to tackle them.  While we are now even more strongly positioned to solve those needs and capture that demand with increased exposure to attractive, durable end markets. We'll come back at these bigger points in a few minutes, but I want to make sure we also give appropriate attention to the very strong quarter we just closed. As we shared in our press release this morning, we significantly exceeded expectations on revenue growth, margin and earnings per share. Organic revenue growth was 15%, with total reported revenue growth of 26%. EPS was up 32% and grew 28%, excluding the impact of the acquisition. And we delivered EBITDA margin well above our guide at more than 19%. It was driven by strong demand and the team's continued focus on pricing as well as ongoing continuous improvement aimed at simplifying how we serve our customers.  Organically, all segments contributed double-digit revenue growth in all end markets. And each of our regions grew, led by notably strong pace in the U.S. and a solid recovery in China. Our legacy backlog was up 7%. And then we added Evoqua's backlog of more than $1 billion, and the 2 together bring our total backlog to $5.3 billion.  Well, we have a lot to do with the integration of these 2 great companies. We have strong commercial momentum, which gives us the confidence to raise our guidance for the year. And again, I want to thank every one of our team members around the world and our partners for what they are doing every day to deliver real impact to our customers and our communities.  In a moment, we'll give more color on our outlook as well as detail on our end markets and regions. But first, I'm going to hand it over to Sandy to dig into the quarter's strong results. Thanks, Sandy. Just a little more than 2 months post close, our excitement about the Evoqua acquisition has only grown. We've made great progress in 3 areas. First is our performance and outlook as the business stands today. We began the integration with an overarching principle, and that was to deliver continuity for our customers, keep our commitments and not disrupt business performance. The results tell a clear story of focused near-term delivery.  The combination of our team's disciplined execution and healthy underlying market demand has given us the confidence to raise our full year guide. But our current performance is, as you would expect, largely a reflection of our businesses as they are. What we're most excited about is our future potential and the opportunities ahead of us, which brings me to the second dimension on which our confidence is only growing.  When the transaction closed, we announced a combined leadership team. And frankly, I'm energized by the strong cultural fit the team has already been demonstrating and the early momentum we've created. We are well on track to deliver the cost synergies outlined when we announced the transaction. And as we progress through the integration, we have even more greater visibility of the operating efficiencies to be realized in coming quarters, along with the opportunity for significant further margin expansion.  At the same time, the whole strategic rationale of this combination has always been about further accelerating our profitable growth. And that's the third dimension I referred to in my opening comments. We are now even more strongly positioned in attractive, durable end markets with a significant component of recurring revenue streams.  Now that we have deeper insight into the intersection of our businesses and customers, we see those opportunities even more clearly.  So moving on to Slide 13. This is the right combination at the right time. Together, we have the strongest platform of capabilities to address customers' critical water challenges. Those needs are increasing, and we have the scale and reach now to deliver differentiated solutions globally. Our teams are already detailing how we will do that.  First, in utilities, we will deepen our penetration, especially with the addition of Evoqua's Applied Product Technologies to our Water Infrastructure offerings. In industrial, we'll use the power of our combined offering to scale our presence in attractive industrial end markets. And then we will expand our Services Solutions business by leveraging Xylem's well-established global distribution platform.  Now as many of you know, this combination delivers on part of the strategy we laid out back in our 2021 Investor Day, and that was to expand our capability and our presence in industrial end markets. Increasing industrial exposure reinforces the durability of our overall business model and gains us greater access to attractive customer sets for even faster long-term growth. The recurring revenues of ISS, which deliver consistent performance throughout economic cycles, it complements our M&CS and Water Infrastructure businesses, which also benefit from the resilience of utility spending.  We've already taken the first steps in offering our combined portfolio to light and general industry customers and we're already targeting attractive industrial verticals such as life sciences and microelectronics. Both have strong long-term outlooks that are driven by secular trends that align well with Xylem's existing business. We look forward to keeping you up to date with our integration progress on a regular basis and anticipate providing a longer-term growth outlook at an Investor Day likely to be scheduled in the first part of 2024.  Now with that, I'm going to hand it over to Matthew to say a bit more about our end market outlook. Thanks, Sandy. We've covered a lot here. So we look forward to your questions. But just before we do that, I want to reiterate a fundamental point. This is a transformational step forward for Xylem, and we believe it is transformational for our customers and our communities. We are very excited about this strategic evolution, but the most important things about Xylem are not changing.  Our investment thesis is one of those unchanging constants. We are creating significant economic and social value with a durable business model that addresses intensifying water challenges. And we're doing that with a differentiated portfolio of solutions and services in attractive and growing end markets. This gives us a multiyear runway of profitable growth with sustainable margin expansion on the foundations of a strong balance sheet and cash generation with capital deployment to further strengthen our portfolio.  It has become increasingly apparent that the need for solutions to the world's water challenges is only growing, and we are in a very privileged position to serve those needs. So now we look forward to taking your questions. So operator, let me turn the call back over to you for Q&A. Deane, before your question, I just want to -- I do want to give a shout out to the entire team here and around the world that have been a part of not just closing this transaction, but all the moving parts and pieces that you talked about. In the midst of exciting momentum, a lot of work, and we really appreciate that recognition. Yes. Thanks, Deane. So I'm going to hand it to Matthew to comment on your specific question. I would say that the integration efforts are really off to a great start. And APT, that part of Evoqua is a clear and obvious opportunity for us, and I've been really pleased and impressed by the cultural assimilation of the teams. But with that, I'll let Matthew comment a bit more on why that integration, why now and what that kind of looks like for us. I'll let Matthew start on where we are on chip supply and then he and I will tag team on where we are in digital. Yes. And I just -- I would wrap that up, Deane, with -- first of all, great question because it's a key underpinning of our overall story and differentiation in the marketplace, which is I know why you raised the question.  So high confidence in both the heritage kind of Xylem business. I would say what I'm most encouraged by there also is we continue to see really exciting adoption on AMI in the marketplace, which really is borne out by the print in our increased backlog and deal wins.  With Evoqua, the opportunity there, it really is more of a complementary strategy on digital. In the Evoqua businesses, we're really talking about the ISS business. The digital path that the team there has been on is really more around how do you use digital and connectivity to actually improve the productivity of the services offering making it easier for AQUApros to do their jobs. That leads to margin enhancement. That's a big opportunity within the ISS portfolio to improve our EBITDA margins by, again, digitally enabling kind of what they do every day, making less truck rolls, less visits to serve the customer, give the customer more data insights, predict where the issues are, before they have to go out and find them.  So there's a whole exciting area there that for those that are new to either the Xylem or the Evoqua story, we'll have more to share on that at our Investor Day going forward. It's very exciting. Yes. So I'll start, Mike, and then I'll hand it over to Matthew. Just to your question, zooming out around utilities, we remain, I would say, more confident than ever around where utilities -- again, this is a global statement where utilities are in the cycle. One, we see here in the U.S. that while we're still early in the adoption of AMI, we continue to see an increased excitement around that. And that shows up in our bidding pipeline. It shows up in our deal wins. It shows up in our backlog. And I think the numbers speak for themselves there on where AMI adoption is going and our ability to successfully compete and win in that space of the market.  Secondly, the -- there are the underlying fundamentals of -- the largest part of utility spend, as you well know, is OpEx, it's repair replace. And given the age of infrastructure around the world, most notably here in North America but also in Europe. We see continued increases in that demand and outlook. And that's going to continue as a long-term trend.  I think in terms of other demand profiles beyond that, as we think about whether it be the Inflation Reduction Act, other infrastructure legislation here in the U.S. We get a lot of questions around PFAS and obviously, with our Evoqua capabilities coming in, that's obviously a very exciting area for us. But as we've said before, and I know Ron, the CEO of Evoqua in the past has said, that's a dimmer switch. It's not like all of a sudden one day it's going to show up. It's going to be adoption over time. And it just reinforces the positive tailwind that we believe we have in the areas that we're focusing on at Xylem.  So that's my commentary around utilities. I don't know, Matthew, if you want to add anything to that. And Joe, you know this already, but for the rest of the listeners, I've been a long-term bull on China just because of the underlying demands and needs from a water and environmental standpoint there continues to be a top policy mandate of the government. You couple that with the strength of our team and our portfolio of offerings. We've weathered a couple of cycles in China over the time that I've been here. But when you go back and look over the last 7 or so years, it's like a double-digit CAGR of growth, and we continue to see that potential going forward. So I'm very proud of the team and optimistic about China for us. Sure. So Nate, this is Patrick. So I go back to the 3 overarching kind of areas that we're focused on. And what I would offer is we've also got special incentives in place for our teams to go capture the revenue synergy because we want people to be highly motivated to go do these things beyond their day job.  So deep in our utility penetration. And that really is around, again, combination of our treatment product portfolio of the 2 companies. They really do complement each other very, very well and leveraging what Xylem's really market-leading utility position is around the world. These are not North America comments alone, they're around the world, is a big opportunity.  Secondly, scaling our offering to industrial customers. Again, we call them industrial, and there's a number of customer sets that are in that area that we think there are big opportunities. We don't think we see big opportunities to really go solve their needs. So if you think about -- well, the third is expanding the ISS offering internationally.  And 2 and 3 have a lot in common because as part of our diligence when we looked at Evoqua, they have a really, really impressive roster of customers market-leading customers that cut across areas of whether it be power, whether it be food and beverage, whether it be life science, whether -- again, whether it be microelectronics that have needed even more Evoqua's capability than Evoqua has been able to provide in the past, especially international. And that's where we, as Xylem, have the footprint and we had the scale and the resources to be able to drive that adoption. Saree you were a bit choppy and breaking. I want to make sure we clarify your question in terms of which segment. Yes. So dewatering had historically, for those that may be relatively new to the story of Xylem, had historically been one of our more cyclical businesses. And because it's such a high-margin business, it would tend to capture spotlight even with a little bit of movement in terms of downturn. And there have been a number of moves that we've made over the past handful of years to diversify the end market exposure of that.  I'll hand it over to Matthew to kind of give his take on kind of where we are positioned right now. But I'm certainly proud of the work the team has done. And there's been a lot of work done on synergy, commercial integration even before the acquisition of Evoqua and I know it's like stronger now. I would just wrap up that answer by saying, I think in this business, like the entire business but certainly in this area, it's about leadership. We've got a strong leadership team in that area that are working together. They're leveraging the portfolio. They're focusing on what happens at a slight kind of local service level. This, just like our ISS business coming in, it's people, very people-driven business. It's an emergency room kind of operation. it's what happens every day, 24/7. And so the hearts and minds of the people really, really matter here. They do everywhere, but they really matter here in terms of what customers experience in the moment. And again, I just give -- I give an applause to leadership team for what they've done. And Brian, this is Patrick. I would just offer up some historical perspective here for those that may be early on in the story here. M&CS is not a turnaround. We -- I mean, this has been an issue in terms of being able to deliver on what has been an impressively growing backlog over the course of the past few years. And we've had margin read-through on what that backlog is for a long time. We've made commitments in the past as to when we reach certain levels of revenue, what the margins would be, that's exactly what you're seeing right now.  So again, I give a shout out to the entire team that drives, especially the metrology part of our business because they've been executing on this ever since we did the acquisition. It's just -- it's always been something along the way. And now we're seeing that the clouds have kind of moved off the horizon and you're now seeing what the full potential or at least the next stage of potential is for this part of our business. Yes. No, certainly, great question, Brian. I mean it was certainly not the reason for the acquisition, but certainly, one of the big benefits is that recurring revenue component. The Evoqua business, we have tremendous line of sight going into any given year based upon contractual commitments as to what that looks like. And so you're talking about the largest portion of their revenue is predictable and repeatable going into the year. And so -- and that really is ISS, which is obviously the largest part of what we got from Evoqua.  If you look at the other parts of our business, historically, our M&CS business, which is metrology, also has a lot of revenue under contract. And so a majority of revenue there is visible going into the year, but not even one year. It's looking at it over the course of a 10- to 12-year time frame, given AMI deals that are there. Water Infrastructure would be the next one, given the fact that we've got such a large installed base of our particularly submersible wastewater pumps, but also our treatment products that we do that are typically long-term kind of projects that we're operating under. And it's just a very stable repair replacement environment. We feel very good about that.  The area -- the business that's always been shorter cycle for us is our Applied Water business. But even there, we would say upwards of 1/3 to 40% of our revenue, while it's not under contract, it's a replacement model. And once you've spec your pumps into a commercial building, or an industrial application, the likelihood of a customer changing out to a new supplier is very low. It's very sticky, and we have market-leading positions there. So even though it's not contractual, we can kind of have that visibility going into the year.  So we will -- in the future, we'll give you specific numbers in the aggregate. I don't want to overcommit to that right now, but we feel very good about the durability and nature of recurring revenue of this business much more now than we did a quarter ago because of bringing in Evoqua. Well, again, I mean, thanks to all of you for your time this morning and for your ongoing support. I look forward to seeing many of you over the coming months here before our next call. And just a reminder, lastly, again, really excited today about the power of the combination of 2 companies coming together that were strong on their own and performing well. And now is the time. It's the right time in this world for these 2 companies to come together because there are so many great water challenges out there to be dealt with, and we feel that we are in a position to really be a meaningful part of that. So thank you all very much."

            "content": "Thank you, Patrick. Turning to Slide 14. Before I cover our end market outlook for the year, I want to thank the team and our partners for a great quarter. Our continued outperformance and momentum give us confidence to deliver in 2023 and beyond. We have record backlogs and the value proposition of our differentiated portfolio in attractive end markets puts us in a strong position even in a potentially dynamic macroeconomic environment. We continue to take a balanced approach in our outlook and are monitoring leading indicators watching for signs of moderation. That said, we expect resilient demand in utilities and continued steady growth in industrial water applications.  And now I'll turn to our 2023 outlook by end market, which will be on an organic basis. Utilities, which is approximately 45% of our revenue continue to be healthy and we now expect growth of mid-teens, up from low teens. On the clean water side, we anticipate growth of low 20s, up from high teens previously due to robust demand for our AMI solutions, and backlog execution on improved chip supply. In addition, we are seeing great traction on solution selling with our digital platform and customers are increasingly interested in bundling offerings.  On the wastewater side, we continue to expect high single-digit growth, resilient OpEx in developed markets as well as continued CapEx spend in emerging markets will underpin demand.  Turning now to the industrial end market, which is 45% of our revenue, we expect steady global growth of mid-single digits, but are keeping a close watch for signs of moderation. We expect any softness from developed markets to be somewhat offset by growth in emerging markets including China, where industrial momentum has continued to outpace utilities.  Lastly, in building solutions, which is about 10% of our revenue, we expect growth of mid-single digits, driven by steady replacement business and backlog execution. The overall demand outlook remains healthy. And although we are not including Evoqua in our organic outlook, we expect the contribution of mission-critical solutions and services in attractive high-growth verticals such as life sciences and microelectronics to further increase the durability of our business. That outlook, combined with our operating discipline, commercial momentum and large backlogs gives us confidence for the rest of the year and beyond.  Now I'll turn it over to Sandy to walk you through the detail of our raised guidance. Thanks, Patrick. Deane, first of all, as Sandy mentioned a few minutes ago in her remarks, they're very complementary businesses, first and foremost. And there is immediate synergies, both on the revenue and the cost side. So that's getting us out of the gate fast. The teams are making great progress, as Patrick mentioned. It allows us to quickly cross-sell our products, both in industrial and utilities. And an example of this would be in the utility space, being able to bundle our solutions and kind of walk through the front door with a total solution across the whole treatment train, if you will, from beginning to end. We didn't have that capability before. Bringing the 2 companies together enables us to bring that full offering to the table.  Also, something that maybe is not as intuitive is our technicians, what we call AQUApros, are out with our customers. Now they have a broader portfolio to solve customer pain points. And we're already seeing that play out just organically with our technicians recommending other -- recommending new products in the portfolio very quickly. So that may be something that's not as intuitive, but it's happening already.  I'd say thirdly, I'd say the R&D synergies. There's obviously R&D synergies when we bring the treatment businesses together. And then lastly, we -- Patrick mentioned leadership in the very beginning. We brought over 3 leaders to the senior leadership team from Evoqua. Herve\u0301 Fages will lead the combined treatment business. He has tremendous experience here and bringing those two pieces together will be instrumental for our out-of-the-gate performance on cost and revenue. Great. Chip supply, Deane, as you mentioned, is continuing to the moderate improvement as we expected. Q3 will look a lot like Q2. We do expect a pickup in Q4 and also as we head into 2024, we do expect chip supply to improve, but also our redesigns will be coming online as we head into the really the end of 2023 into 2024. So that gives us confidence that we'll see that ramp Q4 and then into '24.  Maybe just a few comments on digital and then Patrick can wrap it up. We are making good progress towards the 50% of revenues digital goal. That was a legacy Xylem target. We can see it in the backlog. We have a lot of digital content that's trapped in the backlog. And that will start to release as we get better chip supply and we get better, just in general electronic supply over the course of the next 6 to 12 months. The continued adoption of AMI, as you see in the backlog increase this quarter with M&CS, we're up $300 million. So making significant progress on digital, especially buoyed by AMI.  And then I'd say, lastly, the partnership with Idrica is really important because it enables us to pull through more digital content. We're already starting to see that play out. So I'd say, all in all, we're in a good trajectory, and we're making good progress. I think the only thing I would add to that, we have really close relationship with our customers, especially our utility customers. And based on conversations that we've had with them over the past few months, we don't see a reason that there's going to be any slowdown. The draft muni budgets for the next year for some of our weather utilities are showing growth year-over-year. So I'd say kind of -- that's kind of customer back, the feedback we're getting. Obviously, we play very globally in utilities, not only in the U.S. but half of our revenue is outside the U.S. And to Patrick's point, there's a lot of public funding globally both in the U.K. with the AMP cycle. In China, the EU and then obviously, in the U.S. So feels pretty good. Yes. Joe, it's Matthew. Just maybe just some comments on Europe. It continues to be resilient, especially in utilities, which is over 50% of our revenue in Europe. With the majority of that being in OpEx, as Patrick just mentioned earlier. We were up low teens in orders in Europe in utilities. And so that was really good news. The softness that we're seeing is more on the building solutions side, which is partially offset by industrial.  All in all, Western Europe is up low single digits in orders. So I'd say, all in all, faring pretty well there when you take the balance there in account.  China, which makes up around 6% of our revenues, we saw positive momentum both in orders and revenue in Q2. We were up 20% plus, which although it was an easier compare, it was really great work done by Shuping Lu, who leads our team there and the entire team in China. Just incredible resolve and just really in China for China, localizing products and shifting where some of the slowness is happening and getting into more of the high-growth areas.  Industrial has led the way in China for us, and we're starting to see a little bit of momentum in the utility space. And obviously, in the commercial building space in China, that's where the weakness is, but it's not a big part of our business in China. 75% of our business in China is more utility centric. So all in all, we're very confident in China, and we -- in the long-term outlook, given really the critical nature and focus on water in country there. Great. Yes. In terms of Idrica, just for folks that are on the phone that may not know what Idrica is, it's -- we have an exclusive commercial partnership worldwide with Idrica, which is headquartered in Valencia, Spain. They were born out of the utility operator and the digital platform that they have that we're partnered with, addresses really the biggest pain point we hear from utilities, need for a singular platform to seamlessly integrate all of their applications and data. And I would say we have built really good momentum over the past 4 to 5 months. We've engaged over 200-plus utilities globally, and it's got really global reach, it's fairly balanced across the globe and have built a solid funnel with really significant synergy wins through bundling our solutions.  So I would say it is becoming the beachhead. It will become the beachhead and earlier in Deane's question, is going to help us pull through and drive more digital content and also reoccurring revenue, which is really important.  Just one example I'll give you in the U.S. recently where we leveraged this digital platform, we're calling the Xylem View which is the Idrica platform. We pulled through a large AMI order. Now you're seeing in the backlog. So you saw the backlog grow by $300 million. One of those big synergy wins was due to the digital platform that we enabled and pull through this synergy order. So it's going to help us with recurring revenue, but it's also going to pull through content, which is really strong. Yes. No, it's great, Patrick. We've put a lot of time and effort into dewatering over the past couple of years, Andy. And I would say maybe a couple of things. One is we invested in the fleet, both in Europe and in the U.S., which has really helped us capture more wins. Number two, really coming out of 2019, we needed to diversify our segments in dewatering. We were too oil and gas dependent. And we've done a nice job of mixing into light construction as well as into mini bypass and some different areas that are a bit more profitable and a bit more steady and less cyclical.  So those are a couple of key drivers, I would say that's really helped us. And the last thing I would say in the U.S. where predominantly our revenue is, we've done a good job of driving the businesses together and driving synergies with our service organizations, passing leads back and forth to one another, with our pipeline assessment service businesses, our valve maintenance business and whatnot. So really good on the synergy side that's helped drive growth as well. Yes. Thanks for the question. I'll start us out and then turn it over to Sandy. But we've spent a lot of time in the past 6 to 12 months, really, the past 12 months on M&CS margins. And I'd say there's probably 2 or 3 things I would point to. Number one, obviously, we were hampered by chip supply, not being able to unlock the backlog. And so being able to unlock the backlog is really helped with absorption in our factories and helping cover fixed costs. So that's probably number one.  Number two is we're getting back to productivity in that business. We had to redeploy resources to go after redesign our products for chips. And so productivity has increased this year year-over-year, and we'll continue to drive that in the business.  And then thirdly, I would just say, in general, price cost has been a very good positive over the past 2 to 3 quarters in M&CS, which has helped buoy margins as well. So we'll continue that pace going forward and expect margin improvement sequentially going forward."

Now please turn to Slide 4, and I will turn the call over to our CEO, Patrick Decker.\nPatrick Decker: Thanks, Andrea, and good morning everyone. As we indicated in our press release this morning, the team delivered very strong operational performance in the first quarter, exceeding our expectations on revenue, margin, and earnings per share.  Revenue grew 17% and Earnings per share was up 53%, and we delivered significant EBITDA margin expansion, driven by volume growth on modest supply chain improvements, productivity and operating efficiency, as well as a healthy price/cost mix. We saw backlog growth of 8%, alongside double-digit organic revenue growth in utilities, industrial and commercial. And growth across all regions, most notably the U.S., Western Europe, and key emerging markets, such as Africa, Latin America and China. The team came into the year with good momentum and has capitalized on supply chain improvements and our competitive position to secure customer advantages and convert our backlog. The results reflect resilient underlying demand, as evidenced by sequential orders growth in each segment, our very healthy $3.7 billion backlog, and a book-to-bill ratio greater than one in each segment. Given the team's operating discipline, the continued demand for our solutions and the intensifying long-term secular trends in water, we are confident about our momentum and growth outlook.  So based on that, we\u2019re raising our full-year organic revenue guidance to high single-digits from mid-single-digits and we're raising our EPS guidance. Of course, we'll continue to monitor demand trends, given some macro uncertainty in the broader economy, especially for the second half of the year, but we remain confident in our position for the remainder of the year and beyond. Alongside this quarter's performance, we've also made great progress towards the combination of Xylem and Evoqua. Integration planning is well advanced, and all necessary approval processes are moving ahead as planned. We continue to expect the transaction to close by mid-year. We'll give more color on the Evoqua culmination in a moment, as well as more detail on our outlook end markets and regions. But first, let me now hand it over to Sandy to review the quarter's results.\nSandy Rowland: Thanks, Patrick. Please turn to Slide 5, and I'll cover our first quarter results. As Patrick highlighted, the team built on our momentum coming into 2023 with another healthy quarter of growth and margin expansion. Revenue grew 17% Year-over-Year, led by double-digit growth in the U.S. and Western Europe and high single-digit growth in emerging markets. In a moment, we'll look at detailed performance by segment, but in short, each segment grew double-digits and exceeded our expectations. Utilities, our largest end market, was up 23% with strength in the U.S. driven by continued chip supply improvements in M&CS, as well as price and robust OpEx demand in Water Infrastructure.  Industrial, which is approximately 35% of revenues, grew 13% with strong price realization and solid demand across all regions, particularly in Western Europe. Commercial, which is approximately 10% of our revenues, was up 16% mainly due to continued backlog execution in the U.S.  And Residential, our smallest end market with approximately 5% of revenues, was modestly down. Orders performance overall was better than expected and underlying demand remains resilient.  M&CS was down 17% due to unusually high orders growth of 25% last year as a function of supply-chain lead times. Water Infrastructure orders were up 1% and AWS was down 1%. EBITDA margin was 16.3%, up 210 basis points from the prior year on higher volumes and favorable price cost dynamics. Our EPS in the quarter was $0.72, up 53% year-over-year. Please turn to Slide 6 and I'll review the quarter's performance by segment in a bit more detail.  M&CS, revenue was up 32%, driven by better-than-expected recovery in chip supply. We saw double-digit growth, not only in metrology, but across our M&CS businesses, including Test and Measurement and Pipeline Assessment Services. There was strong performance across all regions, led by U.S. growth of over 40%. As mentioned, M&CS, orders were down in the quarter, but up sequentially.  Demand for our AMI offering remains healthy and our $2.1 billion backlog in M&CS is up 8% versus the prior year. EBITDA margin for the segment was up 690 basis points versus the prior year on strong incrementals. Robust volume conversion, price realization and productivity drove the expansion, more than offsetting inflation and unfavorable mix. And now, let's turn to Slide 7, and I'll cover our Water Infrastructure business.  Water Infrastructure revenues were up 15% versus our guide of high single-digits, due to better price realization globally and stronger-than-expected demand in emerging markets. Growth exceeded our expectations across the portfolio, with revenues up double-digits in all regions and end markets. Geographically, the U.S. was up 22%, with strong price realization on utilities, OpEx demand and backlog execution. Western Europe grew 10%, with robust demand in utilities and industrial. Emerging markets was also up low double-digits, driven by strong OpEx demand in Latin America, Africa and China. Orders in the quarter were up sequentially and up 1% year over year versus double-digit growth last year. EBITDA margin for the segment was down 80 basis points, primarily due to unfavorable mix and strategic investments in digital and solutions selling, partially offset by favorable price cost dynamics. And please turn to Slide 8 for an overview of AWS.  Applied Water revenues grew 10% on strong price realization and improved supply chain. Geographically, Western Europe was up 17% due to backlog execution and healthy industrial and commercial demand. The U.S. was up 10%, driven by backlog execution and strong price realization, particularly in the commercial market. Emerging markets was down low-single digits, primarily due to lapping double-digit growth last year in the Middle East and Eastern Europe. And while orders were down 1% in the quarter, they were stronger than expected and notably, book-to-bill was greater than one.  Segment EBITDA margin was up 480 basis points in the quarter, driven by continued strong price realization and productivity, more than offsetting inflation. And now, let's turn to Slide 9 for an overview of cash flows and the company's financial position.  Our financial position remains robust as we exit the quarter with over $800 million in cash and available liquidity of $1.8 billion. Net debt-to-EBITDA leverage is 1x. Due to seasonality, free cash flow was negative in the quarter, but came in better than expected. While supply chain challenges are not yet behind us, we've made significant progress on working capital and we remain confident in our full-year guidance of 100% conversion. Please turn to Slide 10, and I'll hand it back to Patrick.\nPatrick Decker: Thanks, Sandy. Although it's still early in the year, we look forward with confidence. We have strong momentum coming out of the first quarter, thanks to the team's continued operating discipline and resilient market demand. We'll be even better positioned for growth as we combine Xylem's market-leading portfolio with Evoqua's capabilities and presence in very attractive industrial end markets. And global trends are continuing to drive increasing investment in addressing critical water challenges, reinforcing the foundation of our long-term strategy. While we've been ensuring our team remains focused on meeting customer needs, winning in the marketplace and delivering on operational execution, we've also been preparing for our upcoming combination with Evoqua, which positions us even more favorably for the next phase of Xylem's growth.  As water risks rise in global importance, the combination of these two companies creates a transformative platform for solving customers and communities' most critical water challenges at scale. As we said in January, the deal economics prove out on cost synergies alone. But more importantly, the combined company is positioned for very attractive growth, increasing recurring and resilient revenues and significant margin expansion opportunities in addition to the foundational cost synergies.  On top of this, the combination is supported by a robust financial position and an even stronger balance sheet, which preserves our optionality for the future. Since our January announcement of the transaction, an integration planning team comprising of senior staff from both companies has been working to set the company up for success.  The integration is rooted in four simple principles: first, avoid distraction and deliver our 2023 plans; second, deliver on committed revenue and cost synergies; third, retain, motivate and develop key talent from each company; and lastly, bring the best of both cultures to the combined company. As we advance in the integration process, our confidence and excitement about the synergy potential of the combination continues to grow. And I'm sure many of you have seen Evoqua's second quarter results announced just two days ago. Based on their earnings release, it\u2019s clear both Xylem and Evoqua have strong momentum. We\u2019re remaining focused on serving our customers and delivering on our respective plans for the year. In addition to a solid quarter and confident outlook for the year, we also continue to see evidence of the intensifying secular trends at the foundation of our strategy. In March, the United Nations held its first water conference in over 40 years. It's one of many indicators of the global shift in attention to water and the focus on water's role in sustainable development. Xylem\u2019s delegation engaged with government leaders and development agencies from around the world, particularly on the role of technology and innovation and improving water security. Despite the different worlds the private sector, government and NGOs often inhabit, sustainability is a powerful common language. For example, there was considerable discussion at the conference about water management and greenhouse gas emissions, as water management drives roughly 10% of emissions globally. It's a particular focus in our work with customers, helping them reduce their emissions. And as you'll see in our 2022 sustainability report to be released this month, we've enabled customers to significantly reduce their CO2 footprint, achieving that specific Xylem 2025 sustainability goal well ahead of plan. That's a meaningful step, but there's a long way to go in decarbonizing the water sector more broadly.  Fortunately, we are in the privileged position of helping customers achieve their net-zero carbon goals by deploying more efficient technologies that reduce emissions and their operating costs, ultimately making water more affordable for our communities. That is work that we're both purpose-driven and commercially motivated to do. Our sustainability report also details the progress we've made across the full suite of our 2025 sustainability goals. And I invite each and every one of you to give it your full attention when it's released in the coming days. Now with that, I'll turn it over to Matthew to provide a view on our end market outlook.\nMatthew Pine: Thank you, Patrick. Before I dive into the end market outlook, I want to congratulate the team on a great quarter. We exceeded our expectations across the board and made great progress on productivity initiatives, leading to healthy margin expansion. Overall, we are well-positioned to continue building on this momentum through the rest of the year. Looking ahead, we have taken a balanced approach in our outlook. Given the dynamics of the macroeconomic environment. Our backlogs are strong and underlying demand in our largest end markets continues to be resilient, providing confidence to raise our 2023 guide. That said, we are closely monitoring leading indicators and some of our more cyclical businesses, particularly in developed markets. We expect continued steady demand in emerging markets and are optimistic about a gradual recovery in China through the rest of the year. Utilities, which makes up the largest end market, continues to be healthy, and we now expect growth in low teens in 2023, up from high single-digits. On the wastewater side, we expect high single-digit growth up from mid-single-digit growth. We expect OpEx strength in developed markets as well as continued CapEx spend in emerging markets will result in steady global demand. On the clean water side, we anticipate growth of high-teens, up from low-teens. This increase in our outlook is driven by continued robust demand for our AMI solutions and earlier improvements in chip supply through 2023 as seen in quarter one, allowing for backlog execution. We continue to foresee healthy momentum in our Test and Measurement, and our Pipeline Assessment Service businesses, due to increasing focus on infrastructure and climate challenges. We are also seeing early benefits from the unification of our commercial team in the Americas. The team has made great progress in solution selling to our utility customers, bringing the best of Xylem's offerings to bear solving our customers' highest value challenges. Looking at the industrial end market, we expect to grow mid-single-digits on steady demand for solutions globally. While U.S. industrial production estimates point to potential softening in the back-half of 2023, we expect that to be offset by growth in emerging markets and were supported by our backlog. In addition, our dewatering business continues to see strong demand from mining and emerging markets, particularly in Latin America and is benefiting from strategic investments we've made in our fleet. Moving on to commercial given Q1 out performance, we now expect mid-single-digit growth up from low single-digits. We anticipate continued growth, driven by solid replacement business and backlog execution, partially offset by new construction. We would expect moderation to emerge in the second half results and our monitoring the ABI institutional index and other indicators closely. In residential, our smallest end market, we continue to expect a low-single digit decline, due to normalizing demand in U.S., partially offset by continued resilience in emerging markets. Overall, we feel confident about the resiliency of demand, given our backlog and healthy orders momentum. Now, I will turn it over to Sandy to walk you through our updated guidance.\nSandy Rowland: Thank you, Matthew. Turning to Slide 12. As a reminder, our guidance is on a stand-alone basis and excludes the combination with Evoqua. As Patrick mentioned, we are increasing our full-year guidance for organic revenue growth and adjusted EPS. We are raising our full-year organic revenue growth to 8% to 9%, up from 4% to 6%. This increase is driven primarily by stronger price realization and earlier-than-expected supply chain improvements in the year. In addition, we are lifting our full-year adjusted EPS guidance to $3.15 to $3.35, up from $3 to $3.25. The revised guidance breaks down by segment as follows: high teens growth in M&CS versus previous guidance of low teen; high single-digit growth in Water Infrastructure, up from mid-single-digit growth with solid growth in both wastewater utilities and industrial; and mid-single-digit growth in Applied Water, up from low-single digits with growth in industrial and commercial, partially offset by residential. For 2023, our EBITDA guidance is 17.5% to 18%. And as mentioned, this yields an adjusted EPS range of $3.15 to $3.35. We still expect free cash flow conversion to be 100% of net income. And we've also provided you with a number of other full-year assumptions on the slide to supplement your model. And now drilling down on the second quarter, we anticipate total company revenues will be in the range of 10% to 11% organic growth. By segment, we expect high-teens growth for M&CS and high single-digit growth in Water Infrastructure and Applied Water. We expect second-quarter EBITDA margin to be in the range of 17.5% to 18%, which represents over 100 basis points of improvement versus the prior year, driven by higher volumes and continued price realization and productivity gains. And with that, turn to Slide 13, and I'll turn the call back over to Patrick for closing comments.\nPatrick Decker: Thanks, Sandy. I'm very proud of the team's performance, demonstrating continuing dedication to serving our customers and communities and delivering very strong results. Looking ahead, we're focused on continuing that momentum while also executing a successful integration of Evoqua once the deal closes. We look forward to updating you on that combination in our next earnings call, when I anticipate we will be presenting the performance, outlook and opportunity of our combined company. Now, operator, I'll turn the call back over to you for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question will come from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nDeane Dray: Good morning, everyone.\nPatrick Decker: Hi, good morning, Deane.\nSandy Rowland: Hi, Deane.\nDeane Dray: These are impressive numbers on organic revenue growth and the margins, especially total company margins, but that takes me to the first question on Water Infrastructure. And I know this is seasonally the lowest margin for that segment. But you called out three factors: mix, timing of projects, and some investments like in digital. And I was just hoping if you could size these and maybe give some additional color. Thanks.\nSandy Rowland: Yes, Deane, great question. I think you highlighted some really important points. First of all, Q1 is typically our lowest margin quarter for our Water Infrastructure business. On an EBITDA basis, we were down about 80 bps this quarter. It's really essentially all-in gross profit and it really comes down to two or three items. One, just product mix, a little bit of geographic mix. And we had some larger-scale projects this quarter that typically carry modestly lower margins. And then, we have been continuing to make some investments in this segment. It talks to our optimism about its long-term prospects. And those investments have been really focused on increasing our digital selling and solution selling capabilities, and we're seeing proof of that investment come through in our orders momentum and growth.  And I think, Deane, when you look forward to the rest of the year, we think that Water Infrastructure margins are going to rebound in Q2 and the rest of the year in line with our typical seasonality.\nDeane Dray: All right. That was exactly what. I was looking for. \nPatrick Decker: Hey Deane I would just offer - this is Patrick - that margin improvement is also supported by what we have in backlog. So these orders that are being won based on these investments support that continued improvement in margins.\nDeane Dray: That's great. And that kind of takes me to the next question on M&CS and the chip supply. And Patrick, I remember when this first surfaced, and it was everywhere that everyone was getting these chip supply shortages and it just accentuated the point that Xylem is, from a smart water standpoint, so dependent on semiconductors. But at the time when it was most uncertain, you all said it would be a gradual expectations for a gradual improvement in the supply, and that's exactly how it's been playing out. So where you stand today, how does the backlog look in terms of like past due of M&CS chips, and is just - should we expect this kind of gradual improvement for the balance of the year? Thanks.\nPatrick Decker: Sure, thanks for the question, Deane. I'll hand it over to Matthew to give more color on it.\nMatthew Pine: Hi. Good morning, Deane. Yes, we had, for sure, better-than-expected results in Q1 in metrology. The chip supply continues to be lumpy, but it is continuing to move at a steady incremental pace, to your point. Our backlog continues to be 30% past due. That was last quarter as well because of the continued orders momentum that we've seen in this business, up 8% in metrology, in M&CS. And so we're going to continue to expect modest improvement, and we're still managing the variation in supply. And the one thing I would point out, as a lot of you probably remember, is the book-to-bill for automotive and industrial chips is still plus one. So we're still kind of working through this problem where on the consumer side, you're seeing a little bit more relief. So we're just going to be steady as it goes over the coming quarters, and we'll see those modest improvements. And with those modest improvements, we've taken up our guide from low-teens to high-teens for 2023 for M&CS.\nPatrick Decker: And I would just offer that as well that, one, we\u2019ve continued to hold on to all of our deals in backlog. There have been no cancellations. And so that's continued to be a good sign as we deliver - as we say we're going to deliver. And then certainly, two, as Matthew pointed out, continue to see really strong demand and end market wins, despite the chip supply challenges. So I think the confidence has grown over the course of the past year and more.\nDeane Dray: Great, that's really helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Nathan Jones with Stifel. Your line is now open.\nNathan Jones: Good morning, everyone.\nPatrick Decker: Hi. Good morning, Nate.\nSandy Rowland: Good morning.\nNathan Jones: I'm going to follow-up on the M&CS guidance, chip supply, etcetera, et cetera. I mean, the guidance going from mid-teens to high-teens pretty much just considers the outperformance in the first quarter. If you model it out, the dollars of revenue each quarter doesn't really change for the remaining three quarters. I know you guys have talked about better chip supply, you have product redesigns to use more available chips that come in the back half. Is there still a little bit of maybe overly conservative approach to the guidance for M&CS, just given the improvements that you're seeing plus these product redesigns that start coming out, I think, probably in the third quarter?\nSandy Rowland: Yes, Nate, let me give that a shot. First of all, we're really pleased with what we saw, from a delivery perspective in Q1, and we got out of the gate with a fast start this year. When we look at the next quarter for M&CS, we actually think it looks very similar to what we experienced in Q1. So good strong business in metrology, but also the other businesses that we have in analytics and assessment services, when it all comes together, Q1 and Q2 look pretty similar. And then when we look at the back half of the year, we've got embedded in our guide a modest ramp-up in the back half. And we've got to continue to monitor the chip supply situation. It is not perfect operationally yet.\nMatthew Pine: Yes. I would just add, we're trying to be prudent with the guide. To Sandy's point in the back half, we still don't have good visibility. We do - I call it the daily miracle, we're managing decommits and push outs and come ins of chips, and we're just trying to manage the guide and be prudent in the second half.\nNathan Jones: Okay, that makes sense. Maybe just following up on the 30% of backlog that\u2019s past due, I anticipate that at some point here, the chip supply is going to get significantly better, and you could probably manufacture more than your customers are going to be ready to take, with the bottleneck likely becoming utility labor to go and install these things. How do you think about the progression of that 30% past due working that down to whatever a normal level of past due is and actually burning some of this backlog down '24 or '25, as we go along?\nMatthew Pine: Yes, we'll progressively work the backlog down as the chips come to be more fluid. The bottleneck is not going to be - well the bottleneck now is chip supply, but the next bottleneck will not be our capacity. To your point, it's going to be really working with our customers to make sure they have the deployment capacity. And that's something we're planning on right now and really getting ahead and looking out and projecting with our customers through really the end of 2024 in lining up that capacity for deployment. So we're lockstep with our customers to make sure that we've got that set up as the chip supply continues to improve, that the deployment capacity does not become a bottleneck as we move through 2023 and through 2024.\nPatrick Decker: I would offer up, Nate, as well -\nNathan Jones: Thank you, Matt.\nPatrick Decker: As you probably know, Nate, the nature of these deployments at a utility level, these are years in the development and the approval process. And the main concern the part of utilities is that once they begin to get chip supply, that there\u2019s a steady installation progress for them, so that there's no concerns by regulators as to whether not an approved deal was actually ever going to happen. So once, as long as you're showing steady improvement and deployment, the labor issue will not be a major bottleneck in terms of a major slowdown. And so, there\u2019ll be a good steady progression.\nNathan Jones: Okay. So, I'll pass it on. Thanks for taking my questions.\nPatrick Decker: Thank you.\nSandy Rowland: Thanks, Nate.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Joe Giordano with TD Cowen. Your line is now open.\nJoe Giordano: Hi, good morning guys.\nPatrick Decker: Good morning, Joe.\nSandy Rowland: Good morning, Joe.\nJoe Giordano: So I guess going through this earnings season, we've heard a lot of companies talking about changing in customer buying patterns a little bit and maybe April trends being worse than what the average of the first quarter was. So just curious if you have anything to say there. I'm probably talking more on the industrial side than on the utility side there.\nSandy Rowland: Yes. I mean, Joe, we saw nothing surprising coming out of our April results. Obviously, we're in the process of closing the books there for that month, but nothing has jumped out to be out-of-the-ordinary or change from what we saw in Q1.\nPatrick Decker: And Joe, I think it's also safe to say that one of the things we track, not only in industrial, but across the entire portfolio is our bidding pipeline. And that bidding pipeline continues to be very healthy and growing consistently, so another good indicator. Matthew, you can probably talk to our channel partners on what you're hearing there in terms of the health of their inventory levels.\nMatthew Pine: So from a channel inventory point of view, we do have really good visibility because we have strong relationships with our channel partners. And overall, I'd say levels are healthy, and they're not sitting on excess inventory. On the industrial front, there's not a lot of inventory, it's configured to order, engineered to order. But we have seen good demand in that area, specifically in emerging markets in the first quarter was really strong and resilient in industrial. Utilities, specifically in wastewater OpEx, that's been really healthy, and really resilient through the past 18 months, given our vertical integration in that segment.  On the commercial front, we're still not back to 2019 levels given the continued supply challenges and constraints that we feel in the commercial part of our business. And then lastly, which is resi is the smallest portion of our business. It's well-stocked, and we're seeing a little bit of moderation there.\nJoe Giordano: Fair enough. And then, Patrick on Evoqua, I know you can't say a whole lot, but is there anything you can - any update at all on timing or what are you currently waiting on? And then what can you say about what you've done internally to kind of prepare for this coming in? I know you're not you're not just sitting around waiting for approval. So can you maybe give us a little insight into getting the organization prepped for this?\nPatrick Decker: Sure, yes. No, thanks, Joe. So just on the transaction itself, as I said in our - in our comments, I mean, really pleased with the progress. I'm proud of the team. I mean is a ton of work that goes into this from both companies, while people are doing their day jobs. So a lot of great progress there. There were several countries, obviously, beyond the U.S., that required approval. We've achieved clearance in all of those countries. The only remaining country is China. In China, our filing has been accepted for what we call a short-form review, which typically takes no more than 30 days. And we're moving well through that, and don't expect any issues there. And so, we've got our shareholder votes coming up on May 11th, both sets of shareholders. So we will get through that next week. And again, for all those reasons, we continue to expect to close this by mid-year. So that's on the transaction closure. You're right, we've got a dedicated integration planning team. I've spent a considerable amount of time with Ron Keating, their CEO and his leadership team. Matthew has spent a considerable amount of time with them as well. We've had many, many integration planning meetings. And on the cost side, clear line of sight to what we committed to before, that being $140 million in three years in very simple, straightforward areas. I didn't say simple is easy, but they're simple, but we are not going after rabbits here. We're going after big items, and deliver those as quickly as possible. And again, what we've always been most excited about is the growth synergy. And so, looking there, you're right, we are somewhat limited on how much detail we can get into until we have final regulatory approvals from a competitive standpoint. But as the teams have worked together, we're even more excited about the top-line growth synergies that are out there. As we've mentioned before, we\u2019re most excited about the opportunity to deepen our penetration within utilities of the combined portfolio, to expand both their integrated services and solutions business on the industrial side internationally, but also a number of their treatment products that we can take through our channels internationally. We both have efforts going on around digital services and solutions, and opportunities to leverage our combined platform there to serve needs for different customer sets around the world. And then there's going to be opportunity in synergy in the areas of R&D and innovation, as well as some of our portfolio enhancements in that area. Obviously, Joe, as you know, some of these synergies are going to materialize sooner than later. And we'll be in a position that, once we get the transaction closed, in an upcoming call to give you more clarity on that in terms of how we're thinking about enhanced growth rates of the new company.\nJoe Giordano: Thanks, guys.\nSandy Rowland: Thanks, Joe.\nOperator: Thank you. Thank you. Our next question will come from Mike Halloran with Baird. Your line is now open.\nMike Halloran: Hi, morning, everyone. So\nPatrick Decker: Good morning.\nSandy Rowland: Good morning, Mike.\nMike Halloran: So following up a little bit on, I think, Nate's first question. So you think about - you've seen some steady deployments here, well you're expecting steady deployments here on the M&CS side over the next period of time here, call it a couple of years, which should give you some pretty good visibility. Doesn't it sound like the lag in deployments and delays in deployments have impacted call it, that order cadence. It seems like the bottom was back-half of the year and first quarter saw some nice sequential improvement on that side. I guess I'd like to understand a little bit about what that back fill looks like, what the conversations are looking like, from a pipeline perspective on that side? And how you think about the visibility here over the next period of time when you put those two together? The deployment piece and then how that pipeline and thought process with the customers is going?\nMatthew Pine: Yes. Hi, Mike. It's Matthew. We feel really bullish on it. You can see our orders growth in Q1 was 8%. Maybe just take a step back and look at AMI adoption in total for the U.S., it's only around 30% today. And there's a very strong value proposition for this offering for our utility partners to make them more productive and more efficient in their business. And that's something, coming through the pandemic, they've really gotten laser-focused on. And I would say even with digital, in general, have really latched onto and started to ramp-up their capabilities. So we're very bullish over the - over the long term there will be more and more adoption. We're still kind of in the early innings, kind of 30% in. And then when you take a step-back and look around the globe, other parts of the world are a decade behind the U.S. in adoption of AMI networks. So as we not only work the U.S. marketplace and the U.K., which is also very similar to the U.S., we're now starting to focus on the international front and how we can improve our opportunities there is funding for non-revenue water and smart metering really picks up to some of the subsidies that are coming out in Europe.\nPatrick Decker: And, Mike, it would be worth - Matthew, maybe if you want to give an update. We haven't talked about the Idrica partnership that we announced last earnings call, because that really speaks also to what utilities are doing around the digital side and what we're seeing there in terms of early wins.\nMatthew Pine: Yes, just to reframe it just for folks that were not on the last call, it's an exclusive commercial partnership worldwide. It is a SaaS business model. Idrica is headquartered in Valentia, Spain. They're a leader in what we call data management and analytics. And as we\u2019re out talking to a lot of our utility customers, the biggest pain point we hear from these partners, is the need to have a singular platform to integrate all of their applications and data. They have multiple applications, passwords, logins, siloed information, and this really gives us the platform, much like a smartphone, like in iOS platform to be able to integrate all these disparate systems. It's a proven platform. It's been deployed in over 300-plus utilities. What I like to say a lot is it's built by utility operator for utilities. They actually understand utility workflows, which is really important, coupled with our application knowledge that we have as an OEM. Our teams are building strong commercial momentum. Sandy talked about investments that we're making around the globe, especially in Europe, on digital investments and solution selling to deploy this platform. And we've built a significant funnel over the past three months. And it's really - it also enables us to pull through a significant amount of Xylem content. Now, I would say on the next call, we'll be in a much better position to kind of get into some detail on that as it matures over the next 90 days.\nMike Halloran: Thanks for that. And then maybe a similar conversation, obviously, you don\u2019t have the deployment component necessarily with the core utility pieces within your infrastructure business, but maybe a similar conversation about bidding pipeline, thoughts, domestic versus international and the ability to maintain the momentum on the pump in the treatment side there.\nMatthew Pine: Yes. So I'd say, in Water Infrastructure, the utility business, obviously, OpEx is very strong around the world. We haven't seen a really slow-down in CapEx either. If you think about Europe specifically, they're really wedded to making sure they spend their CapEx. And although, I'm not going to go down the rabbit hole of the infrastructure bill, but over time that will start to drip out and start to really provide long-term support and demand in the utility space with Water Infrastructure, both in the U.S. and around the world. There\u2019s other programs like the European Recovery and Resiliency Act, you've got the AMP cycle the U.K. And all of these are coming online in the next - anywhere from six to 12 to 18 months to really buoy and lift the demand signal for that sector.\nPatrick Decker: And Mike, a couple of other proof points. We look very much at the treatment bidding pipeline, because that's a leading indicator for the health of the wastewater side of utilities. And that bidding pipeline continues to grow off of record levels, to our backlog in Water Infrastructure itself was up 14% in the quarter. So really indicating strong health there in that part of the business.\nMike Halloran: Great. Really appreciate it everyone. Thanks.\nPatrick Decker: Thank you.\nMatthew Pine: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Scott Davis with Melius Research. Your line is now open.\nScott Davis: Good morning, team.\nPatrick Decker: Good morning, Scott.\nScott Davis: I was just kind of curious on how you guys think about the kind of long-term growth algorithm of industrial versus industrial production indicators and when I think about the ebbs and flows, there's so much of the installed base that's probably inefficient. At this point, it could be pulled out. And there's all these new projects, mega projects that we talk a lot about, including some pretty high intensity stuff like semi fabs, I would imagine you guys have a lot of content on. So is there any way to kind of quantify or think about growing 2x IP or 3x or 1.5x. Just kind of curious how you guys think about it internally.\nPatrick Decker: Yes, Scott, great question. So I'll put a caveat upfront and say once we close the transaction with Evoqua, we'll be able to talk much more around how we view their growth outlook and the growth outlook of the combined company, both stand-alone but also through the revenue synergies that we're targeting. But as we just look at our respective participation in the industrial piece of the business, I would say for Xylem because of the nature of what we currently sell into the industrial base tends to be more of a GDP kind of business. We're selling into the periphery of manufacturing facilities. And so as long as the facilities are up and running, they're burning through various types of pumps that we sell replacement into. It\u2019s a good business, good steady, but it's going to typically be in that low-single digit, sometimes mid-single-digit kind of growth.  When you look at what Evoqua does, they're providing very different water management services into the so called industrial users of water. And what drives the growth there, which historically has been in that kind of at least mid-single digit, if not even higher than that, depending upon where they are in the cycle is and this is where we do believe it will outpace broader GDP growth, is because of the increased demands coming into those users around: one, making sure they have access to sustainable water supply to keep their operations up and running. The value of water to them is not the price they pay-per gallon or leader. It\u2019s not a big number for them. The value of water to them is when they don't have it and they are operating in water stressed areas and they have production stoppage and it's lost revenue margin.  The second is the increased regulatory pressure on them to manage their discharge of wastewater. And so, fines, penalties, but also reputational concerns they have and making sure they're seen as responsible citizens in the community. So those are the pressures that we see are really driving the demand right now in that part of what we call the industrial sector of water, and we see that can continuing.\nScott Davis: That's super helpful, Patrick. Am I correct to assume that a semiconductor fab is going to have a pretty large TAM for you guys.\nPatrick Decker: Yes. That is correct.\nScott Davis: Okay, I'll pass it on. Thank you.\nPatrick Decker: Thank you Scott.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Your line is now open.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Hi. Good morning, everyone.\nPatrick Decker: Good morning.\nSandy Rowland: Hi, Andy.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Probably for Matthew. I know you've been working on a number of initiatives to enhance Xylem's productivity. Obviously, Xylem raised revenue guidance nicely for '23. I think you kept your margins. So maybe just more color on the progress you're making and what would you see going forward there?\nMatthew Pine: Yes, I mean I'll start this off and then maybe turn it over to Sandy to kind of wrap this up. But we see really good momentum in driving productivity, Andy, in the business. There are several different areas that we were addressing in doing that, whether it's across simplifying our portfolio, reducing SKUs, making our factories more efficient, in what we build and really moving the long-tail out. In terms of footprint, I mean continued factory rationalization is obviously another point that we're looking at. Also within our M&CS businesses, as we continue to move that business forward, getting after productivity there has been a focus area of ours. It\u2019s been kind of a 2.5% of spend, and we need to get that up around 3.5%, 4%, 4.5%, which is kind of typical of the other two segments. So that's another big focus area as well. And also within M&CS too, if you kind of unpack the backlog, the shift to water - the water mix will pick up over time and provide some nice drop-through in high-caliber margin. So it's a combination of things that we're looking at, holistically, across the business to make sure, over time, we continue to build sequential momentum in the margin line.\nSandy Rowland: Yes. What I'd add on top of that, Andy, is obviously we're very focused on margin expansion and the goals we set for our organization for 2023 contemplated significant margin expansion. I think we've gotten out of the gate with a good start there. And if you look at what we're thinking about the rest of the year, one of the items that we're focused on is what do the incremental margins look like? And our guide contemplates 30% incremental margins at a period where we're continuing to make investments and a period of time where we don't have the most optimal mix, as we work on the deployment. So I think we feel good about where we landed and we're going to continue to be focused on productivity through the rest of the year. And we're going to be focused on making sure that our discretionary costs remain tight.\nPatrick Decker: Yes. We're by no means satisfied yet with even where we are saying margins are going to be this year. Obviously, we're going to continue to run hard to drive those up even more. But again, we feel it's a responsible, prudent guide at this point in time.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Very helpful, guys. And then Patrick, you talked a little bit about Europe and the U.S., in terms of regions, but I think China's been a bit of a drag on your performance in the past. It seems to look a little better in Q1. But what are you seeing out of that region in the near-term going forward?\nPatrick Decker: Yes. Thanks for the question, Andy. It has been talked about a lot. And it really is an emerging bright spot for us because we absorbed some pretty challenging numbers there last year. And you know that I\u2019m a long-term bull on China, just given where they are in the overall investment cycle, from a water standpoint. So, orders in Q1 and revenue were both up high single-digit and outperformed there. Really encouraged by the reopening across China and what's happening from a GDP standpoint there. It really sets us up for a pretty strong year. I would say that we're seeing a faster recovery in the industrial and commercial piece of the market there, than we are utilities. But utilities based upon our bidding pipeline and backlog are set to recover in the second half. So that's a further tailwind for us. And again, the funnel remains very healthy there. So, encouraged by it. Still a long way to go, but we expect it to be a tailwind this year.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Helpful color. Thank you.\nPatrick Decker: Thank you.\nMatthew Pine: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes the Q&A portion of today's call. I would now like to turn the floor back over to Patrick Decker for any additional or closing remarks.\nPatrick Decker: Well, again, thanks, everybody, for your continued interest and questions and the support. Look forward to catching up with you on our next earnings call. And I'm sure we'll see many of you at various conferences between now and then. As always, stay safe. And I look forward to speaking to you again.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's Xylem First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Please disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Sandy Rowland",
            "content": "Thanks, Patrick. Please turn to Slide 5, and I'll cover our first quarter results. As Patrick highlighted, the team built on our momentum coming into 2023 with another healthy quarter of growth and margin expansion. Revenue grew 17% Year-over-Year, led by double-digit growth in the U.S. and Western Europe and high single-digit growth in emerging markets. In a moment, we'll look at detailed performance by segment, but in short, each segment grew double-digits and exceeded our expectations. Utilities, our largest end market, was up 23% with strength in the U.S. driven by continued chip supply improvements in M&CS, as well as price and robust OpEx demand in Water Infrastructure.  Industrial, which is approximately 35% of revenues, grew 13% with strong price realization and solid demand across all regions, particularly in Western Europe. Commercial, which is approximately 10% of our revenues, was up 16% mainly due to continued backlog execution in the U.S.  And Residential, our smallest end market with approximately 5% of revenues, was modestly down. Orders performance overall was better than expected and underlying demand remains resilient.  M&CS was down 17% due to unusually high orders growth of 25% last year as a function of supply-chain lead times. Water Infrastructure orders were up 1% and AWS was down 1%. EBITDA margin was 16.3%, up 210 basis points from the prior year on higher volumes and favorable price cost dynamics. Our EPS in the quarter was $0.72, up 53% year-over-year. Please turn to Slide 6 and I'll review the quarter's performance by segment in a bit more detail.  M&CS, revenue was up 32%, driven by better-than-expected recovery in chip supply. We saw double-digit growth, not only in metrology, but across our M&CS businesses, including Test and Measurement and Pipeline Assessment Services. There was strong performance across all regions, led by U.S. growth of over 40%. As mentioned, M&CS, orders were down in the quarter, but up sequentially.  Demand for our AMI offering remains healthy and our $2.1 billion backlog in M&CS is up 8% versus the prior year. EBITDA margin for the segment was up 690 basis points versus the prior year on strong incrementals. Robust volume conversion, price realization and productivity drove the expansion, more than offsetting inflation and unfavorable mix. And now, let's turn to Slide 7, and I'll cover our Water Infrastructure business.  Water Infrastructure revenues were up 15% versus our guide of high single-digits, due to better price realization globally and stronger-than-expected demand in emerging markets. Growth exceeded our expectations across the portfolio, with revenues up double-digits in all regions and end markets. Geographically, the U.S. was up 22%, with strong price realization on utilities, OpEx demand and backlog execution. Western Europe grew 10%, with robust demand in utilities and industrial. Emerging markets was also up low double-digits, driven by strong OpEx demand in Latin America, Africa and China. Orders in the quarter were up sequentially and up 1% year over year versus double-digit growth last year. EBITDA margin for the segment was down 80 basis points, primarily due to unfavorable mix and strategic investments in digital and solutions selling, partially offset by favorable price cost dynamics. And please turn to Slide 8 for an overview of AWS.  Applied Water revenues grew 10% on strong price realization and improved supply chain. Geographically, Western Europe was up 17% due to backlog execution and healthy industrial and commercial demand. The U.S. was up 10%, driven by backlog execution and strong price realization, particularly in the commercial market. Emerging markets was down low-single digits, primarily due to lapping double-digit growth last year in the Middle East and Eastern Europe. And while orders were down 1% in the quarter, they were stronger than expected and notably, book-to-bill was greater than one.  Segment EBITDA margin was up 480 basis points in the quarter, driven by continued strong price realization and productivity, more than offsetting inflation. And now, let's turn to Slide 9 for an overview of cash flows and the company's financial position.  Our financial position remains robust as we exit the quarter with over $800 million in cash and available liquidity of $1.8 billion. Net debt-to-EBITDA leverage is 1x. Due to seasonality, free cash flow was negative in the quarter, but came in better than expected. While supply chain challenges are not yet behind us, we've made significant progress on working capital and we remain confident in our full-year guidance of 100% conversion. Please turn to Slide 10, and I'll hand it back to Patrick. Thank you, Matthew. Turning to Slide 12. As a reminder, our guidance is on a stand-alone basis and excludes the combination with Evoqua. As Patrick mentioned, we are increasing our full-year guidance for organic revenue growth and adjusted EPS. We are raising our full-year organic revenue growth to 8% to 9%, up from 4% to 6%. This increase is driven primarily by stronger price realization and earlier-than-expected supply chain improvements in the year. In addition, we are lifting our full-year adjusted EPS guidance to $3.15 to $3.35, up from $3 to $3.25. The revised guidance breaks down by segment as follows: high teens growth in M&CS versus previous guidance of low teen; high single-digit growth in Water Infrastructure, up from mid-single-digit growth with solid growth in both wastewater utilities and industrial; and mid-single-digit growth in Applied Water, up from low-single digits with growth in industrial and commercial, partially offset by residential. For 2023, our EBITDA guidance is 17.5% to 18%. And as mentioned, this yields an adjusted EPS range of $3.15 to $3.35. We still expect free cash flow conversion to be 100% of net income. And we've also provided you with a number of other full-year assumptions on the slide to supplement your model. And now drilling down on the second quarter, we anticipate total company revenues will be in the range of 10% to 11% organic growth. By segment, we expect high-teens growth for M&CS and high single-digit growth in Water Infrastructure and Applied Water. We expect second-quarter EBITDA margin to be in the range of 17.5% to 18%, which represents over 100 basis points of improvement versus the prior year, driven by higher volumes and continued price realization and productivity gains. And with that, turn to Slide 13, and I'll turn the call back over to Patrick for closing comments. Hi, Deane. Yes, Deane, great question. I think you highlighted some really important points. First of all, Q1 is typically our lowest margin quarter for our Water Infrastructure business. On an EBITDA basis, we were down about 80 bps this quarter. It's really essentially all-in gross profit and it really comes down to two or three items. One, just product mix, a little bit of geographic mix. And we had some larger-scale projects this quarter that typically carry modestly lower margins. And then, we have been continuing to make some investments in this segment. It talks to our optimism about its long-term prospects. And those investments have been really focused on increasing our digital selling and solution selling capabilities, and we're seeing proof of that investment come through in our orders momentum and growth.  And I think, Deane, when you look forward to the rest of the year, we think that Water Infrastructure margins are going to rebound in Q2 and the rest of the year in line with our typical seasonality. Good morning. Yes, Nate, let me give that a shot. First of all, we're really pleased with what we saw, from a delivery perspective in Q1, and we got out of the gate with a fast start this year. When we look at the next quarter for M&CS, we actually think it looks very similar to what we experienced in Q1. So good strong business in metrology, but also the other businesses that we have in analytics and assessment services, when it all comes together, Q1 and Q2 look pretty similar. And then when we look at the back half of the year, we've got embedded in our guide a modest ramp-up in the back half. And we've got to continue to monitor the chip supply situation. It is not perfect operationally yet. Thanks, Nate. Good morning, Joe. Yes. I mean, Joe, we saw nothing surprising coming out of our April results. Obviously, we're in the process of closing the books there for that month, but nothing has jumped out to be out-of-the-ordinary or change from what we saw in Q1. Thanks, Joe. Good morning, Mike. Hi, Andy. Yes. What I'd add on top of that, Andy, is obviously we're very focused on margin expansion and the goals we set for our organization for 2023 contemplated significant margin expansion. I think we've gotten out of the gate with a good start there. And if you look at what we're thinking about the rest of the year, one of the items that we're focused on is what do the incremental margins look like? And our guide contemplates 30% incremental margins at a period where we're continuing to make investments and a period of time where we don't have the most optimal mix, as we work on the deployment. So I think we feel good about where we landed and we're going to continue to be focused on productivity through the rest of the year. And we're going to be focused on making sure that our discretionary costs remain tight."

            "content": "Thanks, Andrea, and good morning everyone. As we indicated in our press release this morning, the team delivered very strong operational performance in the first quarter, exceeding our expectations on revenue, margin, and earnings per share.  Revenue grew 17% and Earnings per share was up 53%, and we delivered significant EBITDA margin expansion, driven by volume growth on modest supply chain improvements, productivity and operating efficiency, as well as a healthy price/cost mix. We saw backlog growth of 8%, alongside double-digit organic revenue growth in utilities, industrial and commercial. And growth across all regions, most notably the U.S., Western Europe, and key emerging markets, such as Africa, Latin America and China. The team came into the year with good momentum and has capitalized on supply chain improvements and our competitive position to secure customer advantages and convert our backlog. The results reflect resilient underlying demand, as evidenced by sequential orders growth in each segment, our very healthy $3.7 billion backlog, and a book-to-bill ratio greater than one in each segment. Given the team's operating discipline, the continued demand for our solutions and the intensifying long-term secular trends in water, we are confident about our momentum and growth outlook.  So based on that, we're raising our full-year organic revenue guidance to high single-digits from mid-single-digits and we're raising our EPS guidance. Of course, we'll continue to monitor demand trends, given some macro uncertainty in the broader economy, especially for the second half of the year, but we remain confident in our position for the remainder of the year and beyond. Alongside this quarter's performance, we've also made great progress towards the combination of Xylem and Evoqua. Integration planning is well advanced, and all necessary approval processes are moving ahead as planned. We continue to expect the transaction to close by mid-year. We'll give more color on the Evoqua culmination in a moment, as well as more detail on our outlook end markets and regions. But first, let me now hand it over to Sandy to review the quarter's results. Thanks, Sandy. Although it's still early in the year, we look forward with confidence. We have strong momentum coming out of the first quarter, thanks to the team's continued operating discipline and resilient market demand. We'll be even better positioned for growth as we combine Xylem's market-leading portfolio with Evoqua's capabilities and presence in very attractive industrial end markets. And global trends are continuing to drive increasing investment in addressing critical water challenges, reinforcing the foundation of our long-term strategy. While we've been ensuring our team remains focused on meeting customer needs, winning in the marketplace and delivering on operational execution, we've also been preparing for our upcoming combination with Evoqua, which positions us even more favorably for the next phase of Xylem's growth.  As water risks rise in global importance, the combination of these two companies creates a transformative platform for solving customers and communities' most critical water challenges at scale. As we said in January, the deal economics prove out on cost synergies alone. But more importantly, the combined company is positioned for very attractive growth, increasing recurring and resilient revenues and significant margin expansion opportunities in addition to the foundational cost synergies.  On top of this, the combination is supported by a robust financial position and an even stronger balance sheet, which preserves our optionality for the future. Since our January announcement of the transaction, an integration planning team comprising of senior staff from both companies has been working to set the company up for success.  The integration is rooted in four simple principles: first, avoid distraction and deliver our 2023 plans; second, deliver on committed revenue and cost synergies; third, retain, motivate and develop key talent from each company; and lastly, bring the best of both cultures to the combined company. As we advance in the integration process, our confidence and excitement about the synergy potential of the combination continues to grow. And I'm sure many of you have seen Evoqua's second quarter results announced just two days ago. Based on their earnings release, it's clear both Xylem and Evoqua have strong momentum. We're remaining focused on serving our customers and delivering on our respective plans for the year. In addition to a solid quarter and confident outlook for the year, we also continue to see evidence of the intensifying secular trends at the foundation of our strategy. In March, the United Nations held its first water conference in over 40 years. It's one of many indicators of the global shift in attention to water and the focus on water's role in sustainable development. Xylem's delegation engaged with government leaders and development agencies from around the world, particularly on the role of technology and innovation and improving water security. Despite the different worlds the private sector, government and NGOs often inhabit, sustainability is a powerful common language. For example, there was considerable discussion at the conference about water management and greenhouse gas emissions, as water management drives roughly 10% of emissions globally. It's a particular focus in our work with customers, helping them reduce their emissions. And as you'll see in our 2022 sustainability report to be released this month, we've enabled customers to significantly reduce their CO2 footprint, achieving that specific Xylem 2025 sustainability goal well ahead of plan. That's a meaningful step, but there's a long way to go in decarbonizing the water sector more broadly.  Fortunately, we are in the privileged position of helping customers achieve their net-zero carbon goals by deploying more efficient technologies that reduce emissions and their operating costs, ultimately making water more affordable for our communities. That is work that we're both purpose-driven and commercially motivated to do. Our sustainability report also details the progress we've made across the full suite of our 2025 sustainability goals. And I invite each and every one of you to give it your full attention when it's released in the coming days. Now with that, I'll turn it over to Matthew to provide a view on our end market outlook. Thanks, Sandy. I'm very proud of the team's performance, demonstrating continuing dedication to serving our customers and communities and delivering very strong results. Looking ahead, we're focused on continuing that momentum while also executing a successful integration of Evoqua once the deal closes. We look forward to updating you on that combination in our next earnings call, when I anticipate we will be presenting the performance, outlook and opportunity of our combined company. Now, operator, I'll turn the call back over to you for questions. Hi, good morning, Deane. Hey Deane I would just offer - this is Patrick - that margin improvement is also supported by what we have in backlog. So these orders that are being won based on these investments support that continued improvement in margins. Sure, thanks for the question, Deane. I'll hand it over to Matthew to give more color on it. And I would just offer that as well that, one, we've continued to hold on to all of our deals in backlog. There have been no cancellations. And so that's continued to be a good sign as we deliver - as we say we're going to deliver. And then certainly, two, as Matthew pointed out, continue to see really strong demand and end market wins, despite the chip supply challenges. So I think the confidence has grown over the course of the past year and more. Hi. Good morning, Nate. I would offer up, Nate, as well - As you probably know, Nate, the nature of these deployments at a utility level, these are years in the development and the approval process. And the main concern the part of utilities is that once they begin to get chip supply, that there's a steady installation progress for them, so that there's no concerns by regulators as to whether not an approved deal was actually ever going to happen. So once, as long as you're showing steady improvement and deployment, the labor issue will not be a major bottleneck in terms of a major slowdown. And so, there'll be a good steady progression. Thank you. Good morning, Joe. And Joe, I think it's also safe to say that one of the things we track, not only in industrial, but across the entire portfolio is our bidding pipeline. And that bidding pipeline continues to be very healthy and growing consistently, so another good indicator. Matthew, you can probably talk to our channel partners on what you're hearing there in terms of the health of their inventory levels. Sure, yes. No, thanks, Joe. So just on the transaction itself, as I said in our - in our comments, I mean, really pleased with the progress. I'm proud of the team. I mean is a ton of work that goes into this from both companies, while people are doing their day jobs. So a lot of great progress there. There were several countries, obviously, beyond the U.S., that required approval. We've achieved clearance in all of those countries. The only remaining country is China. In China, our filing has been accepted for what we call a short-form review, which typically takes no more than 30 days. And we're moving well through that, and don't expect any issues there. And so, we've got our shareholder votes coming up on May 11th, both sets of shareholders. So we will get through that next week. And again, for all those reasons, we continue to expect to close this by mid-year. So that's on the transaction closure. You're right, we've got a dedicated integration planning team. I've spent a considerable amount of time with Ron Keating, their CEO and his leadership team. Matthew has spent a considerable amount of time with them as well. We've had many, many integration planning meetings. And on the cost side, clear line of sight to what we committed to before, that being $140 million in three years in very simple, straightforward areas. I didn't say simple is easy, but they're simple, but we are not going after rabbits here. We're going after big items, and deliver those as quickly as possible. And again, what we've always been most excited about is the growth synergy. And so, looking there, you're right, we are somewhat limited on how much detail we can get into until we have final regulatory approvals from a competitive standpoint. But as the teams have worked together, we're even more excited about the top-line growth synergies that are out there. As we've mentioned before, we're most excited about the opportunity to deepen our penetration within utilities of the combined portfolio, to expand both their integrated services and solutions business on the industrial side internationally, but also a number of their treatment products that we can take through our channels internationally. We both have efforts going on around digital services and solutions, and opportunities to leverage our combined platform there to serve needs for different customer sets around the world. And then there's going to be opportunity in synergy in the areas of R&D and innovation, as well as some of our portfolio enhancements in that area. Obviously, Joe, as you know, some of these synergies are going to materialize sooner than later. And we'll be in a position that, once we get the transaction closed, in an upcoming call to give you more clarity on that in terms of how we're thinking about enhanced growth rates of the new company. Good morning. And, Mike, it would be worth - Matthew, maybe if you want to give an update. We haven't talked about the Idrica partnership that we announced last earnings call, because that really speaks also to what utilities are doing around the digital side and what we're seeing there in terms of early wins. And Mike, a couple of other proof points. We look very much at the treatment bidding pipeline, because that's a leading indicator for the health of the wastewater side of utilities. And that bidding pipeline continues to grow off of record levels, to our backlog in Water Infrastructure itself was up 14% in the quarter. So really indicating strong health there in that part of the business. Thank you. Good morning, Scott. Yes, Scott, great question. So I'll put a caveat upfront and say once we close the transaction with Evoqua, we'll be able to talk much more around how we view their growth outlook and the growth outlook of the combined company, both stand-alone but also through the revenue synergies that we're targeting. But as we just look at our respective participation in the industrial piece of the business, I would say for Xylem because of the nature of what we currently sell into the industrial base tends to be more of a GDP kind of business. We're selling into the periphery of manufacturing facilities. And so as long as the facilities are up and running, they're burning through various types of pumps that we sell replacement into. It's a good business, good steady, but it's going to typically be in that low-single digit, sometimes mid-single-digit kind of growth.  When you look at what Evoqua does, they're providing very different water management services into the so called industrial users of water. And what drives the growth there, which historically has been in that kind of at least mid-single digit, if not even higher than that, depending upon where they are in the cycle is and this is where we do believe it will outpace broader GDP growth, is because of the increased demands coming into those users around: one, making sure they have access to sustainable water supply to keep their operations up and running. The value of water to them is not the price they pay-per gallon or leader. It's not a big number for them. The value of water to them is when they don't have it and they are operating in water stressed areas and they have production stoppage and it's lost revenue margin.  The second is the increased regulatory pressure on them to manage their discharge of wastewater. And so, fines, penalties, but also reputational concerns they have and making sure they're seen as responsible citizens in the community. So those are the pressures that we see are really driving the demand right now in that part of what we call the industrial sector of water, and we see that can continuing. Yes. That is correct. Thank you Scott. Good morning. Yes. We're by no means satisfied yet with even where we are saying margins are going to be this year. Obviously, we're going to continue to run hard to drive those up even more. But again, we feel it's a responsible, prudent guide at this point in time. Yes. Thanks for the question, Andy. It has been talked about a lot. And it really is an emerging bright spot for us because we absorbed some pretty challenging numbers there last year. And you know that I'm a long-term bull on China, just given where they are in the overall investment cycle, from a water standpoint. So, orders in Q1 and revenue were both up high single-digit and outperformed there. Really encouraged by the reopening across China and what's happening from a GDP standpoint there. It really sets us up for a pretty strong year. I would say that we're seeing a faster recovery in the industrial and commercial piece of the market there, than we are utilities. But utilities based upon our bidding pipeline and backlog are set to recover in the second half. So that's a further tailwind for us. And again, the funnel remains very healthy there. So, encouraged by it. Still a long way to go, but we expect it to be a tailwind this year. Thank you. Well, again, thanks, everybody, for your continued interest and questions and the support. Look forward to catching up with you on our next earnings call. And I'm sure we'll see many of you at various conferences between now and then. As always, stay safe. And I look forward to speaking to you again."

            "name": "Matthew Pine",
            "content": "Thank you, Patrick. Before I dive into the end market outlook, I want to congratulate the team on a great quarter. We exceeded our expectations across the board and made great progress on productivity initiatives, leading to healthy margin expansion. Overall, we are well-positioned to continue building on this momentum through the rest of the year. Looking ahead, we have taken a balanced approach in our outlook. Given the dynamics of the macroeconomic environment. Our backlogs are strong and underlying demand in our largest end markets continues to be resilient, providing confidence to raise our 2023 guide. That said, we are closely monitoring leading indicators and some of our more cyclical businesses, particularly in developed markets. We expect continued steady demand in emerging markets and are optimistic about a gradual recovery in China through the rest of the year. Utilities, which makes up the largest end market, continues to be healthy, and we now expect growth in low teens in 2023, up from high single-digits. On the wastewater side, we expect high single-digit growth up from mid-single-digit growth. We expect OpEx strength in developed markets as well as continued CapEx spend in emerging markets will result in steady global demand. On the clean water side, we anticipate growth of high-teens, up from low-teens. This increase in our outlook is driven by continued robust demand for our AMI solutions and earlier improvements in chip supply through 2023 as seen in quarter one, allowing for backlog execution. We continue to foresee healthy momentum in our Test and Measurement, and our Pipeline Assessment Service businesses, due to increasing focus on infrastructure and climate challenges. We are also seeing early benefits from the unification of our commercial team in the Americas. The team has made great progress in solution selling to our utility customers, bringing the best of Xylem's offerings to bear solving our customers' highest value challenges. Looking at the industrial end market, we expect to grow mid-single-digits on steady demand for solutions globally. While U.S. industrial production estimates point to potential softening in the back-half of 2023, we expect that to be offset by growth in emerging markets and were supported by our backlog. In addition, our dewatering business continues to see strong demand from mining and emerging markets, particularly in Latin America and is benefiting from strategic investments we've made in our fleet. Moving on to commercial given Q1 out performance, we now expect mid-single-digit growth up from low single-digits. We anticipate continued growth, driven by solid replacement business and backlog execution, partially offset by new construction. We would expect moderation to emerge in the second half results and our monitoring the ABI institutional index and other indicators closely. In residential, our smallest end market, we continue to expect a low-single digit decline, due to normalizing demand in U.S., partially offset by continued resilience in emerging markets. Overall, we feel confident about the resiliency of demand, given our backlog and healthy orders momentum. Now, I will turn it over to Sandy to walk you through our updated guidance. Hi. Good morning, Deane. Yes, we had, for sure, better-than-expected results in Q1 in metrology. The chip supply continues to be lumpy, but it is continuing to move at a steady incremental pace, to your point. Our backlog continues to be 30% past due. That was last quarter as well because of the continued orders momentum that we've seen in this business, up 8% in metrology, in M&CS. And so we're going to continue to expect modest improvement, and we're still managing the variation in supply. And the one thing I would point out, as a lot of you probably remember, is the book-to-bill for automotive and industrial chips is still plus one. So we're still kind of working through this problem where on the consumer side, you're seeing a little bit more relief. So we're just going to be steady as it goes over the coming quarters, and we'll see those modest improvements. And with those modest improvements, we've taken up our guide from low-teens to high-teens for 2023 for M&CS. Yes. I would just add, we're trying to be prudent with the guide. To Sandy's point in the back half, we still don't have good visibility. We do - I call it the daily miracle, we're managing decommits and push outs and come ins of chips, and we're just trying to manage the guide and be prudent in the second half. Yes, we'll progressively work the backlog down as the chips come to be more fluid. The bottleneck is not going to be - well the bottleneck now is chip supply, but the next bottleneck will not be our capacity. To your point, it's going to be really working with our customers to make sure they have the deployment capacity. And that's something we're planning on right now and really getting ahead and looking out and projecting with our customers through really the end of 2024 in lining up that capacity for deployment. So we're lockstep with our customers to make sure that we've got that set up as the chip supply continues to improve, that the deployment capacity does not become a bottleneck as we move through 2023 and through 2024. So from a channel inventory point of view, we do have really good visibility because we have strong relationships with our channel partners. And overall, I'd say levels are healthy, and they're not sitting on excess inventory. On the industrial front, there's not a lot of inventory, it's configured to order, engineered to order. But we have seen good demand in that area, specifically in emerging markets in the first quarter was really strong and resilient in industrial. Utilities, specifically in wastewater OpEx, that's been really healthy, and really resilient through the past 18 months, given our vertical integration in that segment.  On the commercial front, we're still not back to 2019 levels given the continued supply challenges and constraints that we feel in the commercial part of our business. And then lastly, which is resi is the smallest portion of our business. It's well-stocked, and we're seeing a little bit of moderation there. Yes. Hi, Mike. It's Matthew. We feel really bullish on it. You can see our orders growth in Q1 was 8%. Maybe just take a step back and look at AMI adoption in total for the U.S., it's only around 30% today. And there's a very strong value proposition for this offering for our utility partners to make them more productive and more efficient in their business. And that's something, coming through the pandemic, they've really gotten laser-focused on. And I would say even with digital, in general, have really latched onto and started to ramp-up their capabilities. So we're very bullish over the - over the long term there will be more and more adoption. We're still kind of in the early innings, kind of 30% in. And then when you take a step-back and look around the globe, other parts of the world are a decade behind the U.S. in adoption of AMI networks. So as we not only work the U.S. marketplace and the U.K., which is also very similar to the U.S., we're now starting to focus on the international front and how we can improve our opportunities there is funding for non-revenue water and smart metering really picks up to some of the subsidies that are coming out in Europe. Yes, just to reframe it just for folks that were not on the last call, it's an exclusive commercial partnership worldwide. It is a SaaS business model. Idrica is headquartered in Valentia, Spain. They're a leader in what we call data management and analytics. And as we're out talking to a lot of our utility customers, the biggest pain point we hear from these partners, is the need to have a singular platform to integrate all of their applications and data. They have multiple applications, passwords, logins, siloed information, and this really gives us the platform, much like a smartphone, like in iOS platform to be able to integrate all these disparate systems. It's a proven platform. It's been deployed in over 300-plus utilities. What I like to say a lot is it's built by utility operator for utilities. They actually understand utility workflows, which is really important, coupled with our application knowledge that we have as an OEM. Our teams are building strong commercial momentum. Sandy talked about investments that we're making around the globe, especially in Europe, on digital investments and solution selling to deploy this platform. And we've built a significant funnel over the past three months. And it's really - it also enables us to pull through a significant amount of Xylem content. Now, I would say on the next call, we'll be in a much better position to kind of get into some detail on that as it matures over the next 90 days. Yes. So I'd say, in Water Infrastructure, the utility business, obviously, OpEx is very strong around the world. We haven't seen a really slow-down in CapEx either. If you think about Europe specifically, they're really wedded to making sure they spend their CapEx. And although, I'm not going to go down the rabbit hole of the infrastructure bill, but over time that will start to drip out and start to really provide long-term support and demand in the utility space with Water Infrastructure, both in the U.S. and around the world. There's other programs like the European Recovery and Resiliency Act, you've got the AMP cycle the U.K. And all of these are coming online in the next - anywhere from six to 12 to 18 months to really buoy and lift the demand signal for that sector. Thank you. Yes, I mean I'll start this off and then maybe turn it over to Sandy to kind of wrap this up. But we see really good momentum in driving productivity, Andy, in the business. There are several different areas that we were addressing in doing that, whether it's across simplifying our portfolio, reducing SKUs, making our factories more efficient, in what we build and really moving the long-tail out. In terms of footprint, I mean continued factory rationalization is obviously another point that we're looking at. Also within our M&CS businesses, as we continue to move that business forward, getting after productivity there has been a focus area of ours. It's been kind of a 2.5% of spend, and we need to get that up around 3.5%, 4%, 4.5%, which is kind of typical of the other two segments. So that's another big focus area as well. And also within M&CS too, if you kind of unpack the backlog, the shift to water - the water mix will pick up over time and provide some nice drop-through in high-caliber margin. So it's a combination of things that we're looking at, holistically, across the business to make sure, over time, we continue to build sequential momentum in the margin line. Thank you."

Now please turn to Slide 4, and I will turn the call over to our CEO, Matthew Pine.\nMatthew Pine: Thanks, Keith. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. As you've seen in our press release earlier this morning, the team delivered very strong earnings in the quarter. In fact, I want to recognize the whole Xylem team for disciplined execution across the business. The result was record EBITDA margins and record earnings per share in the quarter. Operational discipline also delivered accelerated momentum in our integration of Evoqua. We're now well ahead of schedule and capturing the expected cost synergies ending the year above our run rate targets. Our profitability is also beginning to benefit from the work to optimize our portfolio and simplify our organization. All that work is in service of reducing Xylem's complexity in serving our customers better in addition to delivering systematic margin improvement in support of our long-term framework. The team showed great customer focus delivering healthy orders growth across all segments in the quarter. Organic orders were up high single-digits overall, with a book-to-bill greater than one, reflecting strong underlying demand in resilient end markets that continue to prefer our differentiated mission-critical solutions. Moderated revenue growth in the quarter was primarily driven by project timing pushouts in MCS and WSS, combined with tough compares versus prior year. Orders are up sharply in both of those segments, indicating healthy underlying demand and customer preference. Overall, end market demand continues to be resilient with a few pockets of softening in the short term. With good visibility through Q4, we're narrowing full year earnings guidance and maintaining the midpoint despite a slightly lower revenue expectation. Also in Q4, we expect to increase our stake in the Idrica joint venture, giving us a majority ownership position. As a reminder, Idrica is a global leader in data management and analytics for water utilities. The system powering the Xylem view platform at the heart of our intelligent solutions for utilities. Having been borne out of the utility operator itself, the platform has been deployed in more than 300 customers around the world. We took a minority stake last year and became the global distribution partner for the technology. Our teams continue to get traction with customers. And with this transaction, the business will be consolidated into Xylem's Measurement & Control Solutions segment. Now, I'm going to turn it over to Bill to get into the quarter's results, our financial position and our outlook. Bill?\nBill Grogan: Thanks, Matthew. Please turn to Slide 5. Q3 was a strong operational quarter, and I want to thank our entire organization for their focus and effort progressing on our organizational transformation. Productivity and pricing resulted in record-breaking quarterly EBITDA margin and earnings per share. The demand remains solid with our backlog reaching $5.3 billion, driven by notable growth in WSS and water infrastructure, offsetting continued progress executing the past-due backlog in MCS. Our book-to-bill ratio exceeded 1 and orders were healthy, up 8% in the quarter, primarily driven by MCS and WSS. While orders remained strong, revenue growth moderated versus a challenging comparison of 10% growth in the same period last year. Q3 total and organic revenue grew at 1%, slightly below our expectations. The moderation came from project timing in MCS and WSS. The team's operational discipline delivered record quarterly EBITDA margin of 21.2% up 140 basis points from the prior year despite the modest top line growth. Productivity savings and pricing more than offset inflation, investments and mix, driving incrementals of approximately 130% on a consolidated basis. We also achieved a record EPS of $1.11, surpassing the midpoint of our guidance by $0.01 and marking a 12% increase over the prior year. Our balance sheet remains robust with net debt to adjusted EBITDA at 0.6 times. Year-to-date free cash flow has increased by 27% from the prior year. The conversion rate of 79% was driven by higher net income, offset by increased CapEx and net working capital. Working capital efficiency in the quarter was impacted by timing of sales. Let's turn to Slide 6. In Measurement & Control Solutions, we continue to work down our pass-through backlog. Total MCS backlog now sits at roughly $1.9 billion, a 14% organic decrease from prior year, driven by smart metering conversion. Orders were strong at 12%, driven by smart metering and analytics demand. Revenue was up 11%, driven by smart metering demand and backlog execution. This was below our expectations due to project timing, as we were able to ramp up production of past dues faster than our customers were able to schedule their deployments. We are seeing some pockets of softness in Europe and emerging markets, but overall demand is still healthy and the pipeline is strong, particularly for our AMI solutions in North America. We finished the quarter with robust EBITDA margins of 21.2%, up 350 basis points versus the prior year, with 53% incrementals. Year-over-year margin expansion was driven by productivity, price and volume, which more than offset inflation and investments. In Water Infrastructure, orders were up 6% in the quarter, with strong demand across treatment and transport. Revenue increased 1%, driven by transport demand, slightly offset by treatment, which had a difficult comp given strong performance last year from legacy Evoqua's APT segment. EBITDA margin for Water Infrastructure was up 50 basis points. Productivity and price more than off inflation and mix, incrementals were strong at 45%. In Applied Water, orders were up 4% and book-to-bill was 1, reflecting a few large project wins, which will ship next year. Revenues were down 4%, in line with our expectations, primarily driven by softness in emerging markets. Segment EBITDA margin declined 10 basis points year-over-year but increased 110 basis points sequentially. Lower volumes, higher inflation and unfavorable mix were mostly offset by productivity savings and price. Rounding out the segments, Water Solutions and Services saw robust demand with orders increasing 11% driven by strength in outsourced water and in dewatering. Organic revenue was down 1% with strength in dewatering offset by declines in capital sales from treatment projects, primarily due to a difficult comp and project timing within the quarter. Segment EBITDA margin was strong at 24.7%, up 200 basis points. Productivity and price offset inflation and volume declines. Now, let's turn to slide 7 for our updated full year and Q4 guidance. Given our year-to-date performance in both commercial and operational momentum, we are updating part of our full year guidance. Our revenue guide of $8.5 billion results in approximately 15% growth with organic revenue growth of approximately 5%. The Evoqua integration is going very well, and we are accelerating expected cost synergies to an exit run rate of $130 million in 2024. In light of our lower revenue expectations, we are confident about driving further margin expansion through operational productivity and our simplification efforts and are reiterating our EBITDA margin guidance of roughly 20.5%. That represents 160 basis points of expansion versus the prior year, driven by higher volume, productivity, including our cost synergies and price offsetting inflation. We are narrowing EPS guidance to $4.22 to $4.24 from $4.18 to $4.28. Free cash flow conversion for the year is still expected to be at least 120% of net income. We do expect significant conversion in the fourth quarter. The full year outlook for two segments has changed with MCS now expected to grow in mid-teens versus our prior outlook of high teens and WSS now expected to grow low single digits versus our prior outlook of mid-single digits, both due to project delays impacting the second half. For the fourth quarter, we anticipate revenue growth to be roughly 2% to 3% on a reported and organic basis. We expect fourth quarter EBITDA margins to be in the range of 20.5% to 21%, up 70 to 120 basis points. This yields fourth quarter EPS of $1.12 to $1.14. We have solid momentum and continue to have strong orders growth and anticipate healthy long-term demand across our divisions and applications. While we are closely monitoring the macro environment, including election uncertainty, geopolitical tensions and tariffs, our overall outlook for the fourth quarter remains positive. And we look to our simplification efforts and 80/20 implementations to not only help address any short-term challenges we may face but also be among the key drivers to our systematic margin improvement over time, supporting our long-term profitability framework. With that, please turn to Slide 8, and I'll turn the call back over to Matthew for closing comments.\nMatthew Pine: Thanks, Bill. Again, I'm proud of the team's strong results in the quarter. The risk orders growth demonstrate the team's customer focus and commercial momentum, alongside healthy demand for our solutions. The record profitability and margin expansion only comes from real focus on execution, which shows up in the same discipline the team showed to get us out ahead of our integration synergy targets. That accelerated integration in turn, enables us to put greater attention on portfolio optimization and capital deployment. The team's performance is what gives us confidence to narrow the guide as we expect to continue delivering that same level of execution on continuing demand. At the start of the call, I referenced some of the benefits we're beginning to see coming through our work on simplification. Reaffirming what we said at Investor Day in May, we're building momentum and it's showing up in our results. We're doing the meaningful work on our operating model across culture, process and structure, and we're already beginning to see the benefits. I look forward to sharing more about that in coming quarters as the work continues. Lastly, I want to share a change in the executive team, which happened after the quarter's close. You may have seen our announcement appointing Meredith Emerick to lead the Applied Water segment succeeding Franz Cerwinka. I want to thank Franz for his many contributions, not only to Applied Water, but also in his prior leadership of emerging markets. He\u2019ll stay on as a senior adviser to ensure a smooth transition and to maintain the momentum of the segment's 80/20 work. Meredith and I first cross path at Carrier, her experience there and at Mitsubishi has given her deep experience in engineered solutions for commercial and residential buildings across a range of industrial end markets. She has a track record of high-performance P&L leadership and emphasis on profitable growth, operational discipline and customer centricity. We welcome Meredith to the Xylem's leadership team just last week, and I know you value getting to know her in the coming months. With that, operator, I'll turn the call back over to you for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions] Today's first question comes from Deane Dray at RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nDeane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nMatthew Pine: Hey, good morning, Deane.\nDeane Dray: Maybe we can start with just like the tone of business, the timing of decision-making approval process. We're hearing lots of industrial companies talking about those kinds of delays, slower decision-making. And then very specifically, how did this impact WSS, you referenced timing of capital projects. When do you see these outsourcing contracts start to get released and what kind of time frame, we'll start there. Thanks.\nMatthew Pine: Okay. Thanks for the question, Deane. I'll start out, and I'll turn it over to Bill to get into the details. But just to provide some high-level perspective, before I do hand it over to Bill, Q3 is really a tale of what I would call two stories. Utilities end market for us was up 10%, so up double-digits, but although a bit less than we anticipated primarily with M&CS. On the other side of that is the industrial and commercial building end markets were down 4%, respectively. And those are largely due to project pushouts, and I would say some slight softening in our mining verticals internationally. That's where we saw a little bit of softening. But in general, as you see from our orders in the quarter, very strong in general across all the end markets. Maybe I'll just pause there, and maybe turn it over to Bill to get into some detail on WSS.\nBill Grogan: So yeah, the difference between our expectations coming in the quarter for WSS is really, again, just the timing of some of these projects that pushed out in the back half. These aren't cancellations. These are really delays. Some due to just elongated commercial negotiations, Deane, some of these are really complicated outsourced water projects or project delays that we are a component of, and then just some election and interest rate uncertainty giving a little bit of pause in the industrial markets for big projects. We continue to have differentiated technology to support these projects and water is a critical component of the application. So we're highly confident that this is just timing. We have the orders. It's just when do they start to be put in place. Our expectation is a little bit of softness continuing in the fourth quarter and then pick back up again at the beginning of the year based upon all the indicators we're getting. And again, maybe the other thing I would mention is that we had really tough compare in this business as well for the quarter. Last year, pro forma growth was 10% on an organic basis. And we talked last quarter; the 12% growth just put some pressure on the pacing that we experienced in the back half. So fundamentals are still strong, high demand for our unique solutions. A little bit of delay here as we exit the year, but we're confident that we're back positive in the fourth quarter and then ramping in Q1.\nDeane Dray: All right. That was really helpful and broadly consistent with the slower decision-making that we've seen elsewhere. And then just as a follow-up question, can we put the spotlight on MCS. There's been some anxiety, if I can phrase it that way, about the ramp down in the business as you work off past due backlog and you go from some pretty heavy 20% growth down to what we're expecting to be a normalized high single digits, which is still healthy, but just give us where are you in that process? I see the $1.9 billion backlog, how much of that is actually past due. And then meanwhile, you've had really strong orders this quarter. So what is that expectation about the ramp down to high single digits? Thanks.\nMatthew Pine: I'll start it out Deane and just a few comments, maybe specific to Q3 and some of the trends, and then Bill can get into some color in the read-through as we head into 2025. We're now out of the woods on production constraints that we've been talking about for the past couple of years. They've come down very quickly. Our lead times have moved from 52 weeks to five weeks over the course of this year and we're able to ramp up production of the past dues faster than customers were able to reschedule their deployments. That's really the bottom line. And I really want to be clear on this point. This is not a demand issue like a typical destocking. This is a rescheduling of deployments that will happen over the coming months. The demand is there. It's just getting the deployments rescheduled to catch up with the shipments. Really, the market relative to AMI is still underpenetrated, it's less than 50%. Our funnel is up significantly year-over-year, up over 25%. And we're still winning currently out in the marketplace above our current market share. So there's a lot of positives here, a little bit of timing, and I'll let Bill kind of walk you through a little bit more color on that timing.\nBill Grogan: Yeah, Dean, I think we're likely to see this adjustment period last for the next quarter or two as our partners work to align customer home access and the labor schedule needed to nail down the deployment timing. The bottleneck shifted kind of from our production into the channel. So it will take a little bit of time to resolve. We do expect high single-digit growth here in the fourth quarter for that business, but the potential continuation of the rephasing into the first part of next year. But our expectations at this point is for MCS still to be within that high single-digit framework for the year. Just that as we talk about the normalization, and we've had questions just on the order patterns, and just want to remind everyone that historical norm for MCS is book-to-bill of about one, and then we'd have kind of backlog of about 60% of the next year's sales. So we expect to continue to bleed our backlog into the first part of 2025 and then start to be book-to-bill positive as we exit the year and just as they normalize to their historical patterns.\nDeane Dray: Great. That\u2019s really helpful. And not a question, just to shout out. That was a big free cash flow quarter. So congrats to the team.\nBill Grogan: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Mike Halloran with Baird. Please go ahead.\nMike Halloran: Hey. Good morning everyone.\nMatthew Pine: Good morning, Mike.\nMike Halloran: So can we just put a finer point on that MCS then? Because the backlog bleed this year, I know that you're going to continue to execute against the past due backlog next year, you still have very strong orders. Could you just frame what that impact looks like, whether it's how the past due backlog helped the growth rate this year? And is next year a more normal growth year for the MCS segment? Or is there an overhang from the execution against the past due backlog. I know demand is still good. It sounds like the quoting bidding is still where you want it to be but just want to make sure I think those two variables.\nBill Grogan: Yeah. No, for the all intents and purposes, we're pretty well caught up on our past due for the most part. And we're back to our normalized past due levels. So we've been able to progress on that kind of ahead of pace. And again, I think as Matthew highlighted, that's a little bit of the disconnect that was created. Relative to our expectations for next year, like I said, I still think the smart metering business will be at its long-term framework. There might be some timing first half, second half but we expect positive results from that business.\nMike Halloran: Thank you for that. So then kind of on where you are from an internal processes perspective, maybe just an update on where you sit in the segmentation, identification journey of the portfolio? And when you start basically, how broad through that portfolio have we gotten now? And when do we start seeing kind of that push pull of some pressure on revenue as you start executing against some of the areas of the business that maybe don't fit and then seeing the margin benefit from some of those actions. Has that started yet? Or is this more of a next year thing and just kind of an update holistically on the timing there?\nMatthew Pine: Yeah, it's more of a next year thing. We're going to exit, I would say, Mike, in a really good position. 2024 was a year of really deep dive analytics and kind of zeroing up the business and we're through that process. And as we exit 2024, a lot of the implementations happening in Q4, and then we'll start to see results in Q1 through the course of next year. So that's going to really help from a bottom line perspective. We did talk about 80/20 specifically, and there are some other things we're working on, whether that's spans or layers or as we think about our structure, next year that will also help. But I think in the first part of our cycle that we talked about at Investor Day, there will be probably a little bit more pressure on the top line, but we're still very committed to the outlook that we gave 4% to 6% over the course of the next three years.\nMike Halloran : So if I just put those together then, you're basically saying if you take the order patterns, the timing of all these projects, what you're executing on, really no change in the thought process as you work through next year. Next year should look good but normal relative to how you frame things.\nMatthew Pine: Yes.\nMike Halloran : Okay. Thanks everyone. Appreciate it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Scott Davis from Melius Research. Please go ahead.\nScott Davis : Hey, good morning, Matt and Bill.\nMatthew Pine: Good morning.\nScott Davis: Guys, you mentioned price in each of the segments as being a positive. Is that -- should we think about that as price that in the backlog that's coming out that was priced appropriately and obviously higher. But -- or are you still able to get incremental price and new business today?\nMatthew Pine: Yes. I think it's a little bit of both. Scott, as we talked in our Investor Day, we're really targeting to be price/cost positive, which we've been able to continue to do strong results again here in the third quarter with price cost spread of about 60 basis points, we continue to see some of the businesses show significant strength with that. MCS being the largest contributor on price cost with it being greater than 200 basis points. We've seen year-to-date price a little bit ahead of what we expected coming into the year. Some of that is the targeted efforts and results from our 80/20 implementation and then just different parts of the business, leveraging their differentiation to capture more value within their market. So that is a lever we think we're going to continue to try to expand upon as we progress. One, on just the process of pricing internally and how we execute on that and try to eliminate leakage and then the other half on the strategic pricing side. So, we think there's opportunities on both for us to be a continued tailwind as we get into next year and beyond.\nScott Davis : Okay. That's helpful. And then in the prepared remarks, you commented on pockets of Europe and Asia just being a little bit weaker. I imagine that I think China is probably at least half of your Asia business so that I would imagine that explicitly references China. But can you just a little clarity there. Is it -- are there similar reasons for pushbacks like Deane was saying or the -- I know there's been a fair amount of stimulus in China, but it doesn't seem to have helped any companies yet. Is there a little -- maybe just a little color on what your guys on the ground are saying that is this something that it leaks into 2025 or more of a shorter-term hiccup?\nMatthew Pine: So I'll make some comments on China, too. And I think probably the one other area of emerging markets, that's a little bit softer for us is the Middle East and then some specific applications within Africa. But just -- from a China perspective, just to remind everyone, it's about mid-single digits of our total revenue, largely tied to public utilities within water infrastructure, that's about half of our business. There in China is the water infrastructure piece. Q3 orders did decline in kind of the mid-teens and revenue was down low single digits, and that has been decelerating throughout the year. We talked about our expectations for China being roughly flattish, and now it's gone slightly negative. The underlying demand there, especially with municipalities is still strong. But I do think the economic environment there remains difficult, right? Tight liquidity, especially for the municipalities is causing kind of projects to continue to delay and defer the real estate issues that they're having is adversely impacting our building services end market. So, we're keeping a close eye on China. The teams are focused, making their own lock, looking at areas where we have differentiated technology to address some specific opportunity set. But then how do we manage costs and infrastructure on the lower volumes to make sure we're focused on margins. So, I think it's probably something that lingers here in the short term. But China, overall, we'll get back to be a big part of our growth story at some point in time.\nScott Davis: Okay, good color. Thank you. Best of luck guys, I'll pass it on.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Nathan Jones at Stifel. Please go ahead.\nNathan Jones: Good morning everyone.\nMatthew Pine: Hey good morning Nick.\nNathan Jones: I'm going to start on Idrica. You talked about acquiring a majority stake in that business. So, a couple of questions around that. First, any kind of color you can give us on the financial metrics around that valuation and the impact to your financial statements from consolidating it? And then second, on Idrica, how does that change the outlook, the trajectory, your plans for that business now that you have control of it?\nMatthew Pine: Yes. Maybe I'll start us out on the second part, and I'll let Bill get into the financials. We signed an agreement the other day on October 29th, and we plan to close on the business in December, Nate. I would say we took the majority position so we could more deeply integrate and rationalize our R&D investments because there's a lot of overlap and so we wanted to get that synergy and to really integrate it appropriately, we felt like we needed to have a majority share. And then also, we're going to leverage the platform in the user interface and standardize that across Xylem. So, it's going to have a tremendous impact on our ability to scale across the business and really drive synergies and efficiencies. We have a lot of confidence in the platform. It's the -- when we talk to utilities that was out and about in Australia and the U.K. over the past months and their biggest pain point is data management, application management, and we see a lot of interest in this, and we've got a huge funnel, and we're starting to win some big orders. So, strong -- again, strong traction. Orders are balanced across the globe. And I think the last thing I would say, the pull-through on the core business of Xylem has also been a pleasant surprise. So, maybe I'll pause there and then let Bill get into the little bit of financials.\nBill Grogan: Yes, Nathan, I mean, nothing material for this year. We don't plan on closing until late in December. So, it will be meaningful to our economics this year and then we'll lay out kind of more specifics as we guide next year and what the impact will be.\nNathan Jones: Okay. I guess my follow-up then Applied Water. I mean revenue comparisons there have been negative for a few quarters now, but the order comparisons or order growth has been positive for four of the last five quarters. Do you guys think that we've kind of seen the bottom in Applied Water and an expectation for return to growth going forward in 2025?\nMatthew Pine: I think so. Again, right, AW has been our most challenged business here over the last couple of quarters. It is our shortest cycle most cyclical group and it has played out kind of in line with our expectations on that low single-digit decline. We're probably closer to the bottom from where we expect growth rates to be in Q4. That team has done a really good job leveraging their technology and their advantage in several markets to win some larger projects that will help support our expected recovery in 2025. So we're not giving a specific guide now, but I think there is some momentum behind that business that gives us a more positive view going into next year. And, obviously again they\u2019ve been on our longest journey with 80-20. So they're finalizing some business decisions there that might put a little bit of pressure. But outside that, the fundamentals, I think, to your point, are going to get better here over the next couple of quarters.\nNathan Jones: Awesome. Thanks very much for taking my question.\nMatthew Pine: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Damian Karas with UBS. Please go ahead. Hello, Damian, is your line on hold or on mute perhaps? All right. Looks like we don't have Mr. Karas on the line. So we'll move on to our next question from Brett Linzey with Mizuho. Please go ahead.\nBrett Linzey: Hey, good morning all.\nBill Grogan: Good morning.\nBrett Linzey: I wanted to come back to the dewatering. So you noted some strength in the quarter. I know in years past, the dewatering business has picked up a little bit of incremental business from various storm events. Was there any discernible impact in the quarter positive or negative? And then are you contemplating any pickup from restoration efforts into the fourth quarter?\nBill Grogan: Yeah. I would say it's on the fringe. We do go to market through channel partners in some of our territories, and that would determine maybe the level of impact. Maybe if I just elevate from there, the business in general was very strong in Q3, although we did see some pockets of softening in specific mining applications. But holistically for that business, it was pretty resilient. But in terms of the storm impact, it's not a huge impact for us and probably just on the fringes.\nBrett Linzey: Okay, got it. And I just wanted to come back to the margin progression. So you're executing well in a tough macro, but the 4Q year-over-year does step down versus Q3 in the first half. I guess, is this just a function of the lower revenue expectation or mix? Or is there some cost to achieve some of the 80-20 benefits or resource commitments that might be a drag and won't repeat next year?\nMatthew Pine: No, I think it's really just a portfolio mix as water infrastructure increases at a little bit lower margin rate, they have a seasonal increase in Q4. And then we've talked just about MCS having a little bit more of energy exposure versus water in the back half would be the two main things I'd point to.\nOperator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Matthew Pine for any closing remarks.\nMatthew Pine: I failed to mention with the question on Idrica, I was going to mention that our thoughts and prayers are with the citizens of Spain, our colleagues that are there for Xylem as well as our Idrica partners. We've reached out everyone safe and healthy, but we need to keep that country and our thoughts and prayers are going through some devastating impacts from recent flooding. Thanks for your questions. Thanks for everybody that's joined the call, and we appreciate your interest in Xylem. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. We thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines, and have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Bill Grogan",
            "content": "Thanks, Matthew. Please turn to Slide 5. Q3 was a strong operational quarter, and I want to thank our entire organization for their focus and effort progressing on our organizational transformation. Productivity and pricing resulted in record-breaking quarterly EBITDA margin and earnings per share. The demand remains solid with our backlog reaching $5.3 billion, driven by notable growth in WSS and water infrastructure, offsetting continued progress executing the past-due backlog in MCS. Our book-to-bill ratio exceeded 1 and orders were healthy, up 8% in the quarter, primarily driven by MCS and WSS. While orders remained strong, revenue growth moderated versus a challenging comparison of 10% growth in the same period last year. Q3 total and organic revenue grew at 1%, slightly below our expectations. The moderation came from project timing in MCS and WSS. The team's operational discipline delivered record quarterly EBITDA margin of 21.2% up 140 basis points from the prior year despite the modest top line growth. Productivity savings and pricing more than offset inflation, investments and mix, driving incrementals of approximately 130% on a consolidated basis. We also achieved a record EPS of $1.11, surpassing the midpoint of our guidance by $0.01 and marking a 12% increase over the prior year. Our balance sheet remains robust with net debt to adjusted EBITDA at 0.6 times. Year-to-date free cash flow has increased by 27% from the prior year. The conversion rate of 79% was driven by higher net income, offset by increased CapEx and net working capital. Working capital efficiency in the quarter was impacted by timing of sales. Let's turn to Slide 6. In Measurement & Control Solutions, we continue to work down our pass-through backlog. Total MCS backlog now sits at roughly $1.9 billion, a 14% organic decrease from prior year, driven by smart metering conversion. Orders were strong at 12%, driven by smart metering and analytics demand. Revenue was up 11%, driven by smart metering demand and backlog execution. This was below our expectations due to project timing, as we were able to ramp up production of past dues faster than our customers were able to schedule their deployments. We are seeing some pockets of softness in Europe and emerging markets, but overall demand is still healthy and the pipeline is strong, particularly for our AMI solutions in North America. We finished the quarter with robust EBITDA margins of 21.2%, up 350 basis points versus the prior year, with 53% incrementals. Year-over-year margin expansion was driven by productivity, price and volume, which more than offset inflation and investments. In Water Infrastructure, orders were up 6% in the quarter, with strong demand across treatment and transport. Revenue increased 1%, driven by transport demand, slightly offset by treatment, which had a difficult comp given strong performance last year from legacy Evoqua's APT segment. EBITDA margin for Water Infrastructure was up 50 basis points. Productivity and price more than off inflation and mix, incrementals were strong at 45%. In Applied Water, orders were up 4% and book-to-bill was 1, reflecting a few large project wins, which will ship next year. Revenues were down 4%, in line with our expectations, primarily driven by softness in emerging markets. Segment EBITDA margin declined 10 basis points year-over-year but increased 110 basis points sequentially. Lower volumes, higher inflation and unfavorable mix were mostly offset by productivity savings and price. Rounding out the segments, Water Solutions and Services saw robust demand with orders increasing 11% driven by strength in outsourced water and in dewatering. Organic revenue was down 1% with strength in dewatering offset by declines in capital sales from treatment projects, primarily due to a difficult comp and project timing within the quarter. Segment EBITDA margin was strong at 24.7%, up 200 basis points. Productivity and price offset inflation and volume declines. Now, let's turn to slide 7 for our updated full year and Q4 guidance. Given our year-to-date performance in both commercial and operational momentum, we are updating part of our full year guidance. Our revenue guide of $8.5 billion results in approximately 15% growth with organic revenue growth of approximately 5%. The Evoqua integration is going very well, and we are accelerating expected cost synergies to an exit run rate of $130 million in 2024. In light of our lower revenue expectations, we are confident about driving further margin expansion through operational productivity and our simplification efforts and are reiterating our EBITDA margin guidance of roughly 20.5%. That represents 160 basis points of expansion versus the prior year, driven by higher volume, productivity, including our cost synergies and price offsetting inflation. We are narrowing EPS guidance to $4.22 to $4.24 from $4.18 to $4.28. Free cash flow conversion for the year is still expected to be at least 120% of net income. We do expect significant conversion in the fourth quarter. The full year outlook for two segments has changed with MCS now expected to grow in mid-teens versus our prior outlook of high teens and WSS now expected to grow low single digits versus our prior outlook of mid-single digits, both due to project delays impacting the second half. For the fourth quarter, we anticipate revenue growth to be roughly 2% to 3% on a reported and organic basis. We expect fourth quarter EBITDA margins to be in the range of 20.5% to 21%, up 70 to 120 basis points. This yields fourth quarter EPS of $1.12 to $1.14. We have solid momentum and continue to have strong orders growth and anticipate healthy long-term demand across our divisions and applications. While we are closely monitoring the macro environment, including election uncertainty, geopolitical tensions and tariffs, our overall outlook for the fourth quarter remains positive. And we look to our simplification efforts and 80/20 implementations to not only help address any short-term challenges we may face but also be among the key drivers to our systematic margin improvement over time, supporting our long-term profitability framework. With that, please turn to Slide 8, and I'll turn the call back over to Matthew for closing comments. So yeah, the difference between our expectations coming in the quarter for WSS is really, again, just the timing of some of these projects that pushed out in the back half. These aren't cancellations. These are really delays. Some due to just elongated commercial negotiations, Deane, some of these are really complicated outsourced water projects or project delays that we are a component of, and then just some election and interest rate uncertainty giving a little bit of pause in the industrial markets for big projects. We continue to have differentiated technology to support these projects and water is a critical component of the application. So we're highly confident that this is just timing. We have the orders. It's just when do they start to be put in place. Our expectation is a little bit of softness continuing in the fourth quarter and then pick back up again at the beginning of the year based upon all the indicators we're getting. And again, maybe the other thing I would mention is that we had really tough compare in this business as well for the quarter. Last year, pro forma growth was 10% on an organic basis. And we talked last quarter; the 12% growth just put some pressure on the pacing that we experienced in the back half. So fundamentals are still strong, high demand for our unique solutions. A little bit of delay here as we exit the year, but we're confident that we're back positive in the fourth quarter and then ramping in Q1. Yeah, Dean, I think we're likely to see this adjustment period last for the next quarter or two as our partners work to align customer home access and the labor schedule needed to nail down the deployment timing. The bottleneck shifted kind of from our production into the channel. So it will take a little bit of time to resolve. We do expect high single-digit growth here in the fourth quarter for that business, but the potential continuation of the rephasing into the first part of next year. But our expectations at this point is for MCS still to be within that high single-digit framework for the year. Just that as we talk about the normalization, and we've had questions just on the order patterns, and just want to remind everyone that historical norm for MCS is book-to-bill of about one, and then we'd have kind of backlog of about 60% of the next year's sales. So we expect to continue to bleed our backlog into the first part of 2025 and then start to be book-to-bill positive as we exit the year and just as they normalize to their historical patterns. Thank you. Yeah. No, for the all intents and purposes, we're pretty well caught up on our past due for the most part. And we're back to our normalized past due levels. So we've been able to progress on that kind of ahead of pace. And again, I think as Matthew highlighted, that's a little bit of the disconnect that was created. Relative to our expectations for next year, like I said, I still think the smart metering business will be at its long-term framework. There might be some timing first half, second half but we expect positive results from that business. Yes, Nathan, I mean, nothing material for this year. We don't plan on closing until late in December. So, it will be meaningful to our economics this year and then we'll lay out kind of more specifics as we guide next year and what the impact will be. Good morning. Yeah. I would say it's on the fringe. We do go to market through channel partners in some of our territories, and that would determine maybe the level of impact. Maybe if I just elevate from there, the business in general was very strong in Q3, although we did see some pockets of softening in specific mining applications. But holistically for that business, it was pretty resilient. But in terms of the storm impact, it's not a huge impact for us and probably just on the fringes."

            "content": "Thanks, Keith. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. As you've seen in our press release earlier this morning, the team delivered very strong earnings in the quarter. In fact, I want to recognize the whole Xylem team for disciplined execution across the business. The result was record EBITDA margins and record earnings per share in the quarter. Operational discipline also delivered accelerated momentum in our integration of Evoqua. We're now well ahead of schedule and capturing the expected cost synergies ending the year above our run rate targets. Our profitability is also beginning to benefit from the work to optimize our portfolio and simplify our organization. All that work is in service of reducing Xylem's complexity in serving our customers better in addition to delivering systematic margin improvement in support of our long-term framework. The team showed great customer focus delivering healthy orders growth across all segments in the quarter. Organic orders were up high single-digits overall, with a book-to-bill greater than one, reflecting strong underlying demand in resilient end markets that continue to prefer our differentiated mission-critical solutions. Moderated revenue growth in the quarter was primarily driven by project timing pushouts in MCS and WSS, combined with tough compares versus prior year. Orders are up sharply in both of those segments, indicating healthy underlying demand and customer preference. Overall, end market demand continues to be resilient with a few pockets of softening in the short term. With good visibility through Q4, we're narrowing full year earnings guidance and maintaining the midpoint despite a slightly lower revenue expectation. Also in Q4, we expect to increase our stake in the Idrica joint venture, giving us a majority ownership position. As a reminder, Idrica is a global leader in data management and analytics for water utilities. The system powering the Xylem view platform at the heart of our intelligent solutions for utilities. Having been borne out of the utility operator itself, the platform has been deployed in more than 300 customers around the world. We took a minority stake last year and became the global distribution partner for the technology. Our teams continue to get traction with customers. And with this transaction, the business will be consolidated into Xylem's Measurement & Control Solutions segment. Now, I'm going to turn it over to Bill to get into the quarter's results, our financial position and our outlook. Bill? Thanks, Bill. Again, I'm proud of the team's strong results in the quarter. The risk orders growth demonstrate the team's customer focus and commercial momentum, alongside healthy demand for our solutions. The record profitability and margin expansion only comes from real focus on execution, which shows up in the same discipline the team showed to get us out ahead of our integration synergy targets. That accelerated integration in turn, enables us to put greater attention on portfolio optimization and capital deployment. The team's performance is what gives us confidence to narrow the guide as we expect to continue delivering that same level of execution on continuing demand. At the start of the call, I referenced some of the benefits we're beginning to see coming through our work on simplification. Reaffirming what we said at Investor Day in May, we're building momentum and it's showing up in our results. We're doing the meaningful work on our operating model across culture, process and structure, and we're already beginning to see the benefits. I look forward to sharing more about that in coming quarters as the work continues. Lastly, I want to share a change in the executive team, which happened after the quarter's close. You may have seen our announcement appointing Meredith Emerick to lead the Applied Water segment succeeding Franz Cerwinka. I want to thank Franz for his many contributions, not only to Applied Water, but also in his prior leadership of emerging markets. He'll stay on as a senior adviser to ensure a smooth transition and to maintain the momentum of the segment's 80/20 work. Meredith and I first cross path at Carrier, her experience there and at Mitsubishi has given her deep experience in engineered solutions for commercial and residential buildings across a range of industrial end markets. She has a track record of high-performance P&L leadership and emphasis on profitable growth, operational discipline and customer centricity. We welcome Meredith to the Xylem's leadership team just last week, and I know you value getting to know her in the coming months. With that, operator, I'll turn the call back over to you for questions. Hey, good morning, Deane. Okay. Thanks for the question, Deane. I'll start out, and I'll turn it over to Bill to get into the details. But just to provide some high-level perspective, before I do hand it over to Bill, Q3 is really a tale of what I would call two stories. Utilities end market for us was up 10%, so up double-digits, but although a bit less than we anticipated primarily with M&CS. On the other side of that is the industrial and commercial building end markets were down 4%, respectively. And those are largely due to project pushouts, and I would say some slight softening in our mining verticals internationally. That's where we saw a little bit of softening. But in general, as you see from our orders in the quarter, very strong in general across all the end markets. Maybe I'll just pause there, and maybe turn it over to Bill to get into some detail on WSS. I'll start it out Deane and just a few comments, maybe specific to Q3 and some of the trends, and then Bill can get into some color in the read-through as we head into 2025. We're now out of the woods on production constraints that we've been talking about for the past couple of years. They've come down very quickly. Our lead times have moved from 52 weeks to five weeks over the course of this year and we're able to ramp up production of the past dues faster than customers were able to reschedule their deployments. That's really the bottom line. And I really want to be clear on this point. This is not a demand issue like a typical destocking. This is a rescheduling of deployments that will happen over the coming months. The demand is there. It's just getting the deployments rescheduled to catch up with the shipments. Really, the market relative to AMI is still underpenetrated, it's less than 50%. Our funnel is up significantly year-over-year, up over 25%. And we're still winning currently out in the marketplace above our current market share. So there's a lot of positives here, a little bit of timing, and I'll let Bill kind of walk you through a little bit more color on that timing. Good morning, Mike. Yeah, it's more of a next year thing. We're going to exit, I would say, Mike, in a really good position. 2024 was a year of really deep dive analytics and kind of zeroing up the business and we're through that process. And as we exit 2024, a lot of the implementations happening in Q4, and then we'll start to see results in Q1 through the course of next year. So that's going to really help from a bottom line perspective. We did talk about 80/20 specifically, and there are some other things we're working on, whether that's spans or layers or as we think about our structure, next year that will also help. But I think in the first part of our cycle that we talked about at Investor Day, there will be probably a little bit more pressure on the top line, but we're still very committed to the outlook that we gave 4% to 6% over the course of the next three years. Yes. Good morning. Yes. I think it's a little bit of both. Scott, as we talked in our Investor Day, we're really targeting to be price/cost positive, which we've been able to continue to do strong results again here in the third quarter with price cost spread of about 60 basis points, we continue to see some of the businesses show significant strength with that. MCS being the largest contributor on price cost with it being greater than 200 basis points. We've seen year-to-date price a little bit ahead of what we expected coming into the year. Some of that is the targeted efforts and results from our 80/20 implementation and then just different parts of the business, leveraging their differentiation to capture more value within their market. So that is a lever we think we're going to continue to try to expand upon as we progress. One, on just the process of pricing internally and how we execute on that and try to eliminate leakage and then the other half on the strategic pricing side. So, we think there's opportunities on both for us to be a continued tailwind as we get into next year and beyond. So I'll make some comments on China, too. And I think probably the one other area of emerging markets, that's a little bit softer for us is the Middle East and then some specific applications within Africa. But just -- from a China perspective, just to remind everyone, it's about mid-single digits of our total revenue, largely tied to public utilities within water infrastructure, that's about half of our business. There in China is the water infrastructure piece. Q3 orders did decline in kind of the mid-teens and revenue was down low single digits, and that has been decelerating throughout the year. We talked about our expectations for China being roughly flattish, and now it's gone slightly negative. The underlying demand there, especially with municipalities is still strong. But I do think the economic environment there remains difficult, right? Tight liquidity, especially for the municipalities is causing kind of projects to continue to delay and defer the real estate issues that they're having is adversely impacting our building services end market. So, we're keeping a close eye on China. The teams are focused, making their own lock, looking at areas where we have differentiated technology to address some specific opportunity set. But then how do we manage costs and infrastructure on the lower volumes to make sure we're focused on margins. So, I think it's probably something that lingers here in the short term. But China, overall, we'll get back to be a big part of our growth story at some point in time. Hey good morning Nick. Yes. Maybe I'll start us out on the second part, and I'll let Bill get into the financials. We signed an agreement the other day on October 29th, and we plan to close on the business in December, Nate. I would say we took the majority position so we could more deeply integrate and rationalize our R&D investments because there's a lot of overlap and so we wanted to get that synergy and to really integrate it appropriately, we felt like we needed to have a majority share. And then also, we're going to leverage the platform in the user interface and standardize that across Xylem. So, it's going to have a tremendous impact on our ability to scale across the business and really drive synergies and efficiencies. We have a lot of confidence in the platform. It's the -- when we talk to utilities that was out and about in Australia and the U.K. over the past months and their biggest pain point is data management, application management, and we see a lot of interest in this, and we've got a huge funnel, and we're starting to win some big orders. So, strong -- again, strong traction. Orders are balanced across the globe. And I think the last thing I would say, the pull-through on the core business of Xylem has also been a pleasant surprise. So, maybe I'll pause there and then let Bill get into the little bit of financials. I think so. Again, right, AW has been our most challenged business here over the last couple of quarters. It is our shortest cycle most cyclical group and it has played out kind of in line with our expectations on that low single-digit decline. We're probably closer to the bottom from where we expect growth rates to be in Q4. That team has done a really good job leveraging their technology and their advantage in several markets to win some larger projects that will help support our expected recovery in 2025. So we're not giving a specific guide now, but I think there is some momentum behind that business that gives us a more positive view going into next year. And, obviously again they've been on our longest journey with 80-20. So they're finalizing some business decisions there that might put a little bit of pressure. But outside that, the fundamentals, I think, to your point, are going to get better here over the next couple of quarters. Thank you. No, I think it's really just a portfolio mix as water infrastructure increases at a little bit lower margin rate, they have a seasonal increase in Q4. And then we've talked just about MCS having a little bit more of energy exposure versus water in the back half would be the two main things I'd point to. I failed to mention with the question on Idrica, I was going to mention that our thoughts and prayers are with the citizens of Spain, our colleagues that are there for Xylem as well as our Idrica partners. We've reached out everyone safe and healthy, but we need to keep that country and our thoughts and prayers are going through some devastating impacts from recent flooding. Thanks for your questions. Thanks for everybody that's joined the call, and we appreciate your interest in Xylem. Thank you."

[Operator Instructions] Please note that this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Andrea van der Berg, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nAndrea van der Berg: Thank you, Operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Xylem's second quarter 2024 earnings call. With me today are Chief Executive Officer, Matthew Pine; and Chief Financial Officer, Bill Grogan. They will provide their perspective on Xylem's second quarter 2024 results, and discuss the third quarter and full-year outlook. Following our prepared remarks, we will address questions related to the information covered on the call. I'll ask that you please keep to one question and a follow-up and then return to the queue. As a reminder, this call and our webcast are accompanied by a slide presentation available in the Investors section of our website. A replay of today's call will be available until midnight August 6. Additionally, the call will be available for playback via the Investors section of our website under the heading Investor Events. Please turn to slide two. We will make some forward-looking statements on today's call, including references to future events or developments that we anticipate will or may occur in the future. These statements are subject to future risks and uncertainties such as those factors described in Xylem's most recent annual report on Form 10-K and in subsequent reports filed with the SEC. Please note that the company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements publicly to reflect subsequent events or circumstances and actual events or results could differ materially from those anticipated. Please turn to slide three. We have provided you with a summary of our key performance metrics including both GAAP and non-GAAP metrics with references to prior year segment metrics being made on a comparative basis reflecting the change in segment as of the beginning of the year. For purposes of today's call, all references will be on an organic and/or adjusted basis unless otherwise indicated. And non-GAAP financials have been reconciled for you and are included in the Appendix section of the presentation. Now, please turn to slide four, and I will turn the call over to our CEO, Matthew Pine.\nMatthew Pine: Thanks, Andrea. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us today. It's a pleasure to report the achievements of the Xylem team in the second quarter. As you've seen in this morning's release, the team delivered another very strong quarter, outperforming expectations on all metrics. With high single-digit organic growth reflecting gains in both volume and price, the team also expanded adjusted EBITDA margin 170 basis points. And with that outperformance, we delivered adjusted EPS growth of 11%. The story of the second quarter is similar to Q1. On the demand side, our largest markets continue to be resilient. Internally, our outperformance is driven by increasingly disciplined operational execution by the team. This kind of performance momentum is only possible when the whole team is engaged in line to make a difference. And I want to say a big thank you to the whole Xylem team for the dedication and drive they've demonstrated through the first-half of the year. While there were a lot of highlights across the team, I particularly want to mention the standout performance in Measurement & Control Solutions. MCS segment revenue was up 26%, and EBITDA margins are up 700 basis points versus this time last year. The team is doing an outstanding job. Our first-half performance is a reflection of the value creation direction we set early in the year and discussed at Xylem's Investor Day, in May. That direction includes both resilient above-market growth and accelerated margin expansion. It's gratifying to see the kind of momentum reflected in our quarterly performance. In addition, our simplification initiatives in our work on 80/20 are progressing well, and are set to pay off beginning in 2025. Turning to the integration of Evoqua, in late May, we passed the one-year anniversary of our combination with Evoqua. The combination continues to reveal its value. Cost synergies are well on track, and the team is looking to accelerate our pace wherever possible. And our commercial teams are successfully taking Xylem's combined capabilities to the many customers who will benefit from our integrated solutions, both in utility and industrial end markets. With Evoqua integration on track, strong momentum from the first-half, resilient demand, and the team's increasing operational commercial discipline, we're raising our full-year guide for both revenue and margin, increasing our EPS guidance $0.06 from the prior midpoint. In a moment I'll provide an update on our high-impact culture and our leadership alignment, and also on our industry-leading 2030 sustainability goals, but first I'm going to turn it over to Bill to double-click on the quarter's results, our financial position and our outlook. Bill?\nBill Grogan: Thanks, Matthew. Please turn to slide five. Q2 was another great quarter, and I want to thank our entire organization for their amazing work. We outperformed against our guide across revenue, margin, and earnings per share. We continue to see resilient demand, and our backlog is at $5.2 billion, a modest decline from prior year as we execute on MCS past due backlog. Book-to-bill was approximately one, supported by strength in water infrastructure, while organic orders were down 1% in the quarter driven by project timing within MCS and WSS. Total revenues grew 26%, and organic revenue rose 9%, exceeding our guidance on a healthy combination of volume and price. Outperformance was led by MCS and WSS, as we saw growth in all regions led by double-digit growth in the U.S. EBITDA margin was 20.8%, up 170 basis points from the prior year, with productivity savings, strong volume and price more than offsetting inflation, investments, and mix. This reflects incrementals of 28% on a consolidated basis, and 50% on a pro forma basis. Our EPS in the quarter was $1.09, above the high end of our guidance by $0.04 and up 11% over the prior year. Our balance sheet is strong with net debt to adjusted EBITDA at 0.7 times. Year-to-date free cash flow was up 200% versus the prior year. And conversion of 62% is strong given seasonality. This year-over-year improvement was driven by higher net income, offset slightly by increased CapEx. And, we continue to benefit from improved working capital efficiency. Please turn to slide six. Measurement and Control Solutions had another great quarter, and again, exceeded our expectations. MCS revenue is up 26% driven by smart metering demand and backlog execution. However, due to project timing orders were down 18% and book-to-bill came in under 1. We worked down past to backlog. And total backlog for MCS now sits at roughly $2 billion, A 12% organic decrease from prior year. We finished the quarter with impressive EBITDA margins of 23.4%, up 700 basis points versus the prior year and up 70 bps sequentially. Margin expansion was driven by volume, price, productivity, and favorable mix, more than offsetting inflation. As a reminder, we continue to expect a margin headwind from mix in the second-half as energy meters account for a larger portion of our sales. In Water Infrastructure, orders were up strong, 8% in the quarter, led by robust treatment demand. Revenue exceeded our expectations with total growth of 22% and organic growth of 7%, driven by healthy demand across all regions and applications. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the segment was down 60 basis points with roughly 40% pro forma incrementals. This decline was driven by inflation and acquisition, but was offset partially by productivity, volume, and price. Without the impact of acquisitions, adjusted EBITDA margin improved 40 basis points for the quarter. In Applied Water, orders were up 5% and book-to-bill was greater than 1, reflective of a few large project wins which will ship next year. Revenues were down 4% in line with our expectations lapping strong comps and 12% growth in the second quarter of last year. Decline was primarily driven by softness in developed markets. Segment EBITDA margin declined 200 basis points year over year, but increased 100 basis points sequentially. Higher inflation and unfavorable mix was partially offset by productivity savings. Closing the segments with Water Solutions and Services, orders declined 1% organically driven by timing of large capital projects, offset by strength in the watering. Organic revenue was up 12% with healthy growth across most of the business. Adjusted EBITDA margin was strong at 23.8%. Up 60 basis points and driven by volume, productivity, and price. Offset in part by unfavorable mix and inflation. Two quarters in re-segmentation, we continue to see synergy momentum and benefits for our customers in combining our service-based offerings. Now, let's turn to slide seven for updated full-year and Q3 guidance. Given our first-half outperformance and both commercial and operational momentum, we are raising our full-year guide. We are increasing our revenue guide by approximately $50 million, up from $8.5 billion. This reflects an additional 0.5 point of growth at the midpoint versus our prior guidance. That will put total revenue growth at approximately 16% and organic revenue growth at 5% to 6%. The integration is going smoothly and we continue to expect $100 million of exist run rate cost synergies in 2024 with a potential to accelerate by yearend. We are confident about driving further margin expansion with operational productivity and are raising our EBITDA margin guidance to about 20.5%. That represents 160 basis points of expansion versus the prior year, driven by higher volume, productivity including cost synergies and price offsetting inflation. Our updated EPS guidance of $4.18 to $4.28 reflects an increase of $0.06 at the midpoint. Free cash flow conversion for the year is now expected to be over 120% of net income. The full-year outlook at the segment level remains largely unchanged with the exception of MCS, which we now expect to grow at high teens during our first-half performance versus our previous outlook of low teens. For the quarter, we anticipate revenue growth will be 3% to 5% on a reported and organic basis. We expect third quarter EBITDA margin to be in the range of 20.5% to 21%, up 70 to 120 basis points, driven by higher volumes, continued price realization, and productivity gains. This yields third quarter EPS of $1.07 to $1.12. Our diversified portfolio of mission-critical products and services positions us well to address our customers' evolving needs, and we anticipate healthy demand across most end markets and applications. And we talked about our driving profitability through simplification efforts and our 80/20 implementations at the Investor Day in May. We are progressing well on those initiatives, and I want to reiterate our commitment to systematic margin improvement through operational excellence, supporting our long-term profitability framework. While we are closely monitoring the macro environment, including geopolitical, election uncertainty, and tariffs, our overall outlook for the year remains positive. With that, please turn to slide eight. And I'll turn the call back over to Matthew for closing comments.\nMatthew Pine: Thanks, Bill. I'd like to mention two events in the quarter that don't show up in the financial results but are fundamental to Xylem's success and impact. First, in June, just a few weeks after our Investor Day, we gathered Xylem's global leadership team in Washington, D.C. This was the first time we had our top 150 executives in one room, spanning legacy Xylem and legacy Evoqua. It was an energizing two days of collaboration focused on the work of leadership alignment and culture. I've spoken before about culture as the fundamental how Xylem -- how we'll deliver stronger execution of our strategy? How we'll realize our aspirations? How we'll create our next chapter of Xylem's impact. You can see in our second quarter results that the team is already working well and winning. What our Leadership Summit reinforced was how much more value creation potential we have ahead of us, with an aligned team and a high-impact culture. It was fantastic to see the team so engaged by the opportunities ahead of us. Last quarter also saw the publication of our annual sustainability report. We're very pleased to be tracking well towards our 2025 goals, but we took the opportunity presented by this year's report to set out our aspirations beyond 2025. We're raising the bar again by setting 2030 sustainability goals in three strategic areas. The first is decarbonization, reducing our own greenhouse gas emissions and enabling our customers to decarbonize. Secondly is water stewardship aimed at reducing water demand, and finally, we'll provide access to water, sanitation, and hygiene for 80 million people. All three strengthen our customer relationships and increase our impact. Before turning to your questions, I have one more special note. This is Andrea van der Berg's last quarterly earnings call at the helm of Investor Relations. We're happy to announce that Andrea's taking on a new role within Xylem, and it's an exciting new opportunity for her. Over the years, so many of you have told me you deeply value Andrea's energy, accessibility, and professionalism, and I've benefited from her insightful counsel and positive encouragement in every circumstance. So, thank you, Andrea. Some of you have already met Keith Muller, who's taking the reins as our investor relations leader. Keith has had great impact as the Head of Finance in Water Solutions and Services segment, having joined us with the Evoqua combination more than a year ago. He brings deep knowledge of the business to his leadership of IR. And I'm confident you'll enjoy getting to know Keith and will find great value in his insights and perspectives. And with that, let's go to your questions.\nOperator: And we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And at this time, we'll pause momentarily for the first question. And our first question today will come from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nDeane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nMatthew Pine: Hey, good morning, Dean.\nDeane Dray: Hey, I'll add my welcome to Keith, and wish Andrea best of luck and thanks for all your help.\nAndrea van der Berg: Thank you, Dean.\nDeane Dray: Hey, maybe we can start with 80/20, and I'll also make the observation you can see 80/20 at work in your conference call prepared remark and slides, and how much they've been slimmed down, and you get right to the point. So, really appreciate that. So, 80/20, I know you say the payoff is likely a 2025 of that, but we heard lots of specifics at the Analyst Day on the rollout. So, any updates you can share, I know we're still in the early innings, but you had Applied Water North America initially, MCS initially, any early actions, and what can you share? Thanks.\nMatthew Pine: Yes. No, no, happy to give an update. So, again, the teams are progressing well. Like you said, we have three businesses in the thick of implementing the toolset. North American AWS and North American M&CS smart metering businesses, they're a few months ahead of global transport that kicked off in the second quarter. And we actually just had a kickoff for Applied Water, in Europe, that started on their journey last week. AWS and smart metering have gone through their initial quads and quartile analysis. And now they're working through the [need] (ph) of segmenting their businesses, how they want to support their ongoing customer base, and building their [zoom up] (ph) P&Ls really highlighting the appropriate level of resources they need to run those businesses. They've come out with some initial price increases. Again, those benefits take a little while to work their way through the backlog. So, again, no material short-term benefit, but we see a significant pickup at the end of this year, leading into 2025, where we'll see a more material P&L hit or pickup. The teams are focusing on communicating with their customers and how their toolset is going to impact them, really talking to their largest customers on how these changes will benefit them in the long-term, really improving the overall experience with Xylem as we bring new product innovation to them faster, improve our delivery and quality to them, so a lot of excitement around the toolset externally for their customer bases. So, progress continues. I think we're right on schedule. Again, confident in the value 80/20 is going to bring and provide for us over the next several years, really in line with what we highlighted in the additional impact the toolset is going to have in the framework we laid out back in Investor Day.\nDeane Dray: That's a really helpful update, Bill. Thanks. And given that most of the operating results, so are either as expected or a little bit better. I could ask a broader industry question, if I could, just implications on the Supreme Court overruling the Chevron doctrine, I know we're still in the early innings, but any kind of high level thoughts what the ripple effects might be in PFAS remediation at the federal level, the super-fun timing? And look, I know it's not in your numbers, it's not in your three-year guide, but just the idea here is what might the implications be? And I can see that, at state level, that's where all the remediation efforts have been going in any way. And the states, like California, are not waiting for the federal government to lead the way. So, just from your perspective and insight, how do you think this plays out?\nMatthew Pine: Thanks for your question, Deane. We didn't see this one coming. If you asked us three months ago, this was not on our radar. So, we're reacting to lots of different volatility out in the marketplace. But the Supreme Court striking this down, the Chevron doctrine, it does introduce some uncertainty in some regulations and federal laws, there's the risk of being challenged, much like the EPA's final rule on PFAS, to your point. Additionally beyond that, Deane, there's litigation ongoing already that's challenging EPA's cost estimates used to set the MCL level, the maximum contaminate level, that four parts per trillion, as you're aware. And it's only going to potentially push out what's already a long phasing timeline of three years to test and five years to mitigate PFAS. So, to your point, we think, ultimately, the states are going to fill in the gaps if the national PFAS regulation is reversed. We don't really anticipate that, but if it does you've got about 11 states today that have MCL, the maximum contaminate level for PFAS in drinking water already, even another 12 states that have some kind of PFAS regulation around guidance health or notification levels, things of that nature, and that's over half the U.S. population. So, while it may stumble a little bit out of the gates and there's going to be some challenges, that we're already seeing challenges in litigation, that's why we didn't bake it into our long-term framework. We just think it's too far out. But we stand ready to and well-positioned to partner with utilities, and we have partnered with utilities, as you know, and helping them manage this and other emerging contaminants. So, more to come, but that's kind of what we think.\nDeane Dray: It's real helpful. Thank you.\nMatthew Pine: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Mike Halloran with Baird. Please go ahead.\nMike Halloran: Hey, morning, everyone. Thanks, Andrea.\nMatthew Pine: Morning.\nAndrea van der Berg: Thanks, Mike.\nMike Halloran: So, just level-setting some stuff here, if I look at -- obviously very healthy margins on the quarter, and Bill's earlier comment on the momentum there holds. But if you think about your demand commentary as well as how you're characterizing the second-half of the year, it doesn't feel like much has changed from a trend, thought process on how you're guiding the second-half of the year. Just want to clarify that and any thoughts around that?\nMatthew Pine: Yes, Mike. No change or expectations for the second-half. Yes, I think it's playing out exactly how we thought when we gave our update last quarter. Yes, with the exception that we had some accelerated performance in M&CS, which drove us to take up our full-year guide, we increased our full-year revenue guidance up to 5% to 6% and some timing of capital projects in WSS that drove better results in the second quarter. Sequentially, Q3 looks a lot like Q2 from a dollars perspective, which is more challenging year-over-year comps really driving the lower implied organic growth rate. So, we're still confident, bullish in most of our end markets. The macro noise that we highlighted is there's things out there, but from our perspective, we don't see material impact or any signaling of expected slowdown for us. M&CS, there's still high demand for our smart metering products and our differentiated AMI network. Orders were down, but again, that's primarily just project timing. There's still a strong funnel of large deals in the U.S. and Europe and we had several wins recently, a really good one that leverages synergy sale with the [Adrica] (ph). So, the team continues to do an excellent job of finding new projects and winning new business. WSS, again, really strong growth, just really the timing of capital projects there, but they still have strong demand across the legacy ISS and the watering business. They had some orders lumpiness. Again, we had a huge build on operate project last quarter. We have a couple more of those in the funnel that could be realized in the orders here over the back-half of the year. So, really nothing there that is any concern, so bullish around kind of their high growth verticals. Water Infrastructure, again, really strong performance on healthy demand, high-single-digit orders with growth across all the regions, treatment was up over 20% with some large project wins. The Transport business is one of our most differentiated business, and continues to perform well. So, our developed markets and pretty much all our applications within WI are doing extremely well. AWS obviously is the one market that remains a little bit challenged. Again, it's our shortest cycle, most cyclical group of businesses. But what we've seen there has been pretty consistent with our expectations, kind of low-single-digit, second-half comps get a little bit easier, so they'll gradually get to a lower organic decline. And then some of the project wins that we highlighted in the prepared remarks, we'll start to get them back on the road to growth in 2025.\nMike Halloran: Super helpful. And then maybe some thoughts on how you think backlog tracks from here and what normal looks like once you work through the pass through backlog across a couple of segments, and how we think book-to-bill should track?\nMatthew Pine: Yes. I would say backlog is still really strong. It declined slightly organically, that's primarily just us continue to work down the MCS past due backlog. That's a tough one to forecast just because of the lumpiness of some of the large projects within MCS and again just the new business opportunities within WSS on the build on operate. So, I think we'll bleed a little bit here as we progress the year, but still confident in kind of our long-term growth frameworks for the individual segments getting into 2025. So, I would say lumpiness probably gives us a little bit of caution to give you a specific number, but again, robust demand and outlook for most of our end markets.\nMike Halloran: And Bill, you mean bleed to a more normalized level because of the past due backlog normalization? Are you suggesting something different?\nBill Grogan: No, exactly. That's spot on.\nMike Halloran: Awesome, great. Thanks, everyone. Appreciate it.\nBill Grogan: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Scott Davis with Melius Research. Please go ahead.\nScott Davis: Hey, good morning everybody and congrats Andrea, on your move. Hey, guys, you didn't talk at all about capital deployment, which is fine because you still have Evoqua coming in. But is there a certain tipping point where you get more confident being able to do deals? Are we close to that? Are we there? Just some commentary would be helpful.\nMatthew Pine: Good question. Again, like you mentioned, Scott, our first priority is to focus on the integration of Evoqua. And I think you can see from the results that we're doing a great job on both the cost synergies, they're tracking well as well as the revenue synergies. We have, Scott, built a lot of muscle on M&A over the past 18 months with the planning of Evoqua, now the passing one year of execution. So, we've started to build that muscle in the organization, which is going to help us going forward. Maybe the other thing I'd just reiterate that I said at Investor Day is that we've also put in place what I would call a strong bottoms up process in our M&A kind of acquisition process to drive more consistent organic growth and deployment. And I think that's going to help us over the cycle. So, obviously, we just laid out the three year framework. It's not going to happen overnight, but I can tell you that we're very active and we have a very strong pipeline that we're managing. And it aligns well to the value mapping that we just finished up. So, again, we're going to continue to run those targets through our decision criteria, that strategic fit, financials has got to make sense. We're not going to do anything silly. And really to your point kind of organizational readiness, I think we're trending well, we've got good momentum and ready to execute our M&A pipeline. Some of it's just timing, but it is an important piece as we outlined at Investor Day to our EPS growth at mid-teens over the cycle. So, we're very active, but some of it's just timing and we're still in early innings.\nScott Davis: Okay. Good question or a good answer. Thank you. And guys, I don't I'm sure you don't want to give a lot of detail here, but you referenced the large project wins. I assume those are domestic. Are they related to mega projects? Can you give us a little bit of color on kind of the scope and size historically versus how you kind of think about what large looks like? I mean, there're so many big semi plants, just stuff out there of scope that we've never seen before that love to get a little color from you on those projects, if you can.\nMatthew Pine: Yes, I think back in Investor Day, we talked about data centers that's starting to ramp up for us, and especially in our applied water business. But I think we're positioned uniquely to, Scott in the fact that we also move water through pumping, we treat it and then we also sense for it. So, as we're winning these kind of data centers, we can offer a more turnkey solution and we're kind of working at bottoms up as well as some of the actual providers that are building the data centers themselves. So, that's started to pick up some momentum. We had a nice win in applied water. We've had a couple actually kind of at the $7 million to $10 million range. And so, that's going well. Also, I'd say on the power transition, we highlighted a big win last quarter with green hydrogen. And so, the water needed for that over a 20 year contract is big. We've got some other ones that have not kind of fit within the quarter that are in the pipeline that we have got a lot of momentum around as well around power and we see more and more consistency in the semiconductor space with microelectronics and the need for clean water. And a lot of these places have water scarcity issues. And so, the water reuse is super important there. So, I would say that, some of these high growth verticals, we're seeing momentum in big projects. And we don't see that slowing, we see it only continuing and it will be a little lumpy within WSS specifically, but we see good momentum and a good pipeline.\nScott Davis: Okay. Thank you, and congrats on the first couple of quarters of the year here, well done. I'll pass it on.\nMatthew Pine: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Nathan Jones with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nNathan Jones: Good morning, everyone.\nMatthew Pine: Good morning.\nNathan Jones: I want to start off with some follow-up questions on MCS. Orders down in the quarter, I understand there's some lumpiness around that, but orders have been down have declined a little bit last couple of years, burning off some backlog in '23 and '24. Maybe you could just talk about the visibility into the order pipeline that you have to see that turnaround and start heading in the right direction to support growth. And with that, I know high-single-digits to long-term kind of guidance here, but you are burning a fairly significant amount of backlog down in 2024. Should we expect the 2025 growth to be a little bit lower than the long-term average because you're comping against that backlog burn?\nMatthew Pine: Yes. I'd start us out here and then maybe turn it over to Bill. Again, just a reminder, we're still in fairly early innings to mid innings in AMI adoption. So, there's a lot of runway out there. And although it doesn't always show up in orders, we do obviously put some of the orders in backlog and it's or some of the contracts in backlog and how they convert to orders can be a little lumpy. And this is also a reminder that only 20% of that business is kind of big deals, 80% of it is book and ship or what we call flow. But Nate, just looking at the pipeline that I see, we've got a lot of room for continued growth in that business. And we don't see it slowing down. It's just a matter of timing, more than anything.\nBill Grogan: Yes. No, our expectation next year is that it will be in line with our long-term framework. It's just the backlog league to get us there. So, may be a little bit stronger before we get to kind of that high single-digits at some point in time next year.\nMatthew Pine: Yes. And I think you had asked a few calls ago about where we are in past due. We expect to be almost complete with the past due backlog by the end of the year and probably wrap that up in Q1 of next year. So, that burn is happening and obviously leading to the increased guide and M&CS revenue at the high teens.\nNathan Jones: Second one I wanted to ask was on cash conversion. Obviously, the guidance has taken up to 120%. And I would think that 80/20 in the simplification initiatives should have an impact on working capital probably over the next at least couple of years that maybe drive cash conversion higher than the long-term average as you simplify the business, take inventory out, work on receivables and payables and stuff like that. So, any commentary you can give us on opportunities you're seeing in working capital as a result of these 80/20 and simplification initiatives. Thanks.\nBill Grogan: Yes. No, Nate, I think you're exactly right. That's a big part of the tool set as you start to reduce a lot of the complexity of the product portfolio. We get a lot more efficiency through just faster-moving inventory. Obviously, you reduced the complexity of a tremendous amount of long-tail customers and your DSO improves from that perspective. So, I totally agree, we'll see some benefits. The team does a phenomenal job right now with our overall cash conversion. But I think 80/20 will be able to take it to the next level. But I think that will be on the back end of the P&L benefits that we get. So, probably looking at as you get through the implementation, we said, hey, 12 to 18 months to realize the P&L benefits, it's probably in that 18 to 24 months. That's the second phase of simplification on the back end.\nNathan Jones: Made sense. Thanks very much for taking my questions.\nBill Grogan: Thanks, Nate.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Joe Giordano with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nJoseph Giordano: Hey, good morning, guys.\nBill Grogan: Hey, good morning, Joe.\nJoseph Giordano: Andrea, thanks for everything. You've been a huge help. If we -- if anything happens with water infrastructure, we'll now know who to blame on it.\nAndrea van der Berg: Thank you, Joe. It's been a project.\nJoseph Giordano: A lot of my questions have been asked already, but maybe if you could touch on since moving the service business and combining it with WSS, like any like concrete kind of examples of how this is changing like conditions on the ground for you guys and leading to better results.\nMatthew Pine: Yes, I can start this out. I mean I think that obviously, we did it for a few reasons. One is to increase our synergies because there is a lot of synergies when you now can move water and treat water. And so, now we're able to go in with the turnkey solution. We're already seeing probably that segment be the quickest to drive synergies, some of those we highlighted at the Investor Day. So, also, I'd say just a common tool set. When you think about back office, we had two service companies when we put the two companies together, the legacy vocal business was much more mature, had good processes and tools. And now leveraging that across the entire services business has been a big help. And I think probably the biggest thing is, over time will be our technician utilization, being able to utilize technicians across the entire portfolio. Now everybody is not completely spungable, but say a third to half of your technicians now can flex and do other types of work that they were doing before. And it also gives our Aqua Pros as what we call them, a broader career path. So, I'd say there's different aspects of how we're seeing it play out, but it's the fastest part of our revenue synergy right now, and it's working well.\nJoseph Giordano: And then if I can ask maybe you talked about data center and stuff like that. If I think about like the large project pipeline at WSS and maybe also like general industrial-type exposure to infrastructure, are you seeing any bifurcation there because data center is definitely strong, but the commentary around large project activity in other sectors is kind of weakening. So, curious if you're seeing like puts and takes in any of those businesses there?\nMatthew Pine: Not really. I mean, data centers that I think as I've mentioned, is not a huge part of our portfolio. It mainly shows up in Applied Water, although we've seen some synergies that we mentioned one of those in China at our Investor Day, but we've seen some other synergies where managing water at a data center as well as doing treatment. But it's not something that's going to be a big swing for us because it's not a large part of our business. But in general, we're seeing high growth verticals like pharma, life sciences, microelectronics, power, continue to be really robust. And look, no matter what regulations are, whatever's happening from that perspective, what's happening around climate and water scarcity is driving a lot of interest. I mean, I get phone calls all the time from leaders and CEOs in different parts of the world that are dealing with some real challenging stuff in terms of being able to keep their operations open, or the quality of their water, because of maybe saltwater intrusion, dealing with a different type of water they're trying to treat. So, we don't see any real slowdown. We're in really strong high growth verticals. And datacenters is one that's not big for us, but we're going to take advantage of it while it's hot.\nJoseph Giordano: Thanks, guys.\nMatthew Pine: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Andrew Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Good morning, everyone. Andrea, thanks so much for your help.\nAndrea van der Berg: Thank you, Andrew.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: So, Matthew, Bill, you mentioned inflation and water infrastructure and margin that segment after being up nicely in Q1, year-over-year was down a bit in Q2. I know you said that acquisition, that was acquisition-related, but could you give more color into what you're seeing on the price versus cost side, particularly in that segment? Did anything materially change or is it just lumpiness? And we know you have some China exposure in there, so maybe you could talk about the competitive environment in China?\nMatthew Pine: Price-cost was positive there. I think the biggest impact, and that's why we highlighted just the acquisition element, second quarter last year, during the short time that APT was part of that segment, it had an unusually high margin. It was in the low 20s versus its normalized rate of the teens. So, that was the biggest difference. That's why we added in the pro forma margin expansion, 40 bps, and it was at 40% performance incremental. So, fundamentally, the profit there is still strong. It's sequentially improved. We expect it to continue to sequentially improve as we progress to the back-half and have year-over-year margin expansion. I would say from a water infrastructure perspective, they do have probably the largest piece of our China exposure. China's been a little bit lumpy for us. It's actually the first-half it's been positive from a revenue perspective. The orders were down, but we see some of the larger projects, especially within treatment, continue to get delayed just as I think China is trying to figure out the overall economic situation and how they're going to fund several things across their investment framework. So, that's probably the one area we are continuing to keep our eye on as things just seem to be perpetually shifting to the right.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Very helpful. And then, just maybe focusing a little more on applied water, orders; as you said, look good, they were for long cycle projects, maybe talk about the short cycle market as you see it. Is the business sort of bouncing along the bottom? What's the channel telling you? And you obviously mentioned the easier comparison in the second-half of the year. So, I know you talked about applied water returning growth in 2025, but it couldn't do that before the end of the year.\nMatthew Pine: Yes, I think third quarter is still down, low single digits. Fourth quarter is probably closer to zero. Again, it's relatively in line, I mean, sequentially, the dollar amounts. The decline is largely seen in developed markets and primarily in our commercial and industrial space. Again, from a macro perspective, the institutional ABI has been negative for 16 consecutive months. And we continue to see manufacturing PMI, which are good indicators for us for that business. But I give the teams a lot of credit. Matthew highlighted; they're making their own luck. They're leveraging their differentiated technology to win some of these larger projects to get back on a growth track into next year.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: I appreciate all the color.\nMatthew Pine: Thanks, Andy.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Bryan Blair with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nBryan Blair: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Andrea, thank you very much for your help.\nMatthew Pine: Good morning Bryan.\nAndrea van der Berg: Thank you, Bryan.\nBryan Blair: Very solid quarter and MCS again, MCS's margin again stood out. I'm sorry if I missed this detail, but Bill, you have called out and been very upfront about there being some mixed headwinds going into the back-half with energy deployments. Are you willing to size that sequential headwind relative to the strength of 1H?\nBill Grogan: Yes, I mean, we think it could be around 100 basis points in the back-half, sequential decrease from where we finished the first-half.\nBryan Blair: Okay, understood. Appreciate that. Something you offer a little more color on how treatment orders phase through the quarter. I think you cited around 20% growth there, so very robust for a business that tends to be leading indicator. Any meaningful differences by region that you would call out, and how does treatment moment influence your team's confidence in the back-half of that one?\nMatthew Pine:\n. :\nBryan Blair: Very encouraging. Thank you again.\nMatthew Pine: Thank you.\nOperator: And this concludes the Q2 earnings call. I would like to turn it back to Matthew Pine for any closing remarks.\nMatthew Pine: Thank you. We will wrap it there. Thanks for your questions, and thanks for everyone who joined today. As always, we appreciate your interest in Xylem, and all the very best.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines at this time.",

            "content": "Thanks, Matthew. Please turn to slide five. Q2 was another great quarter, and I want to thank our entire organization for their amazing work. We outperformed against our guide across revenue, margin, and earnings per share. We continue to see resilient demand, and our backlog is at $5.2 billion, a modest decline from prior year as we execute on MCS past due backlog. Book-to-bill was approximately one, supported by strength in water infrastructure, while organic orders were down 1% in the quarter driven by project timing within MCS and WSS. Total revenues grew 26%, and organic revenue rose 9%, exceeding our guidance on a healthy combination of volume and price. Outperformance was led by MCS and WSS, as we saw growth in all regions led by double-digit growth in the U.S. EBITDA margin was 20.8%, up 170 basis points from the prior year, with productivity savings, strong volume and price more than offsetting inflation, investments, and mix. This reflects incrementals of 28% on a consolidated basis, and 50% on a pro forma basis. Our EPS in the quarter was $1.09, above the high end of our guidance by $0.04 and up 11% over the prior year. Our balance sheet is strong with net debt to adjusted EBITDA at 0.7 times. Year-to-date free cash flow was up 200% versus the prior year. And conversion of 62% is strong given seasonality. This year-over-year improvement was driven by higher net income, offset slightly by increased CapEx. And, we continue to benefit from improved working capital efficiency. Please turn to slide six. Measurement and Control Solutions had another great quarter, and again, exceeded our expectations. MCS revenue is up 26% driven by smart metering demand and backlog execution. However, due to project timing orders were down 18% and book-to-bill came in under 1. We worked down past to backlog. And total backlog for MCS now sits at roughly $2 billion, A 12% organic decrease from prior year. We finished the quarter with impressive EBITDA margins of 23.4%, up 700 basis points versus the prior year and up 70 bps sequentially. Margin expansion was driven by volume, price, productivity, and favorable mix, more than offsetting inflation. As a reminder, we continue to expect a margin headwind from mix in the second-half as energy meters account for a larger portion of our sales. In Water Infrastructure, orders were up strong, 8% in the quarter, led by robust treatment demand. Revenue exceeded our expectations with total growth of 22% and organic growth of 7%, driven by healthy demand across all regions and applications. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the segment was down 60 basis points with roughly 40% pro forma incrementals. This decline was driven by inflation and acquisition, but was offset partially by productivity, volume, and price. Without the impact of acquisitions, adjusted EBITDA margin improved 40 basis points for the quarter. In Applied Water, orders were up 5% and book-to-bill was greater than 1, reflective of a few large project wins which will ship next year. Revenues were down 4% in line with our expectations lapping strong comps and 12% growth in the second quarter of last year. Decline was primarily driven by softness in developed markets. Segment EBITDA margin declined 200 basis points year over year, but increased 100 basis points sequentially. Higher inflation and unfavorable mix was partially offset by productivity savings. Closing the segments with Water Solutions and Services, orders declined 1% organically driven by timing of large capital projects, offset by strength in the watering. Organic revenue was up 12% with healthy growth across most of the business. Adjusted EBITDA margin was strong at 23.8%. Up 60 basis points and driven by volume, productivity, and price. Offset in part by unfavorable mix and inflation. Two quarters in re-segmentation, we continue to see synergy momentum and benefits for our customers in combining our service-based offerings. Now, let's turn to slide seven for updated full-year and Q3 guidance. Given our first-half outperformance and both commercial and operational momentum, we are raising our full-year guide. We are increasing our revenue guide by approximately $50 million, up from $8.5 billion. This reflects an additional 0.5 point of growth at the midpoint versus our prior guidance. That will put total revenue growth at approximately 16% and organic revenue growth at 5% to 6%. The integration is going smoothly and we continue to expect $100 million of exist run rate cost synergies in 2024 with a potential to accelerate by yearend. We are confident about driving further margin expansion with operational productivity and are raising our EBITDA margin guidance to about 20.5%. That represents 160 basis points of expansion versus the prior year, driven by higher volume, productivity including cost synergies and price offsetting inflation. Our updated EPS guidance of $4.18 to $4.28 reflects an increase of $0.06 at the midpoint. Free cash flow conversion for the year is now expected to be over 120% of net income. The full-year outlook at the segment level remains largely unchanged with the exception of MCS, which we now expect to grow at high teens during our first-half performance versus our previous outlook of low teens. For the quarter, we anticipate revenue growth will be 3% to 5% on a reported and organic basis. We expect third quarter EBITDA margin to be in the range of 20.5% to 21%, up 70 to 120 basis points, driven by higher volumes, continued price realization, and productivity gains. This yields third quarter EPS of $1.07 to $1.12. Our diversified portfolio of mission-critical products and services positions us well to address our customers' evolving needs, and we anticipate healthy demand across most end markets and applications. And we talked about our driving profitability through simplification efforts and our 80/20 implementations at the Investor Day in May. We are progressing well on those initiatives, and I want to reiterate our commitment to systematic margin improvement through operational excellence, supporting our long-term profitability framework. While we are closely monitoring the macro environment, including geopolitical, election uncertainty, and tariffs, our overall outlook for the year remains positive. With that, please turn to slide eight. And I'll turn the call back over to Matthew for closing comments. No, exactly. That's spot on. Thank you. Yes. No, our expectation next year is that it will be in line with our long-term framework. It's just the backlog league to get us there. So, may be a little bit stronger before we get to kind of that high single-digits at some point in time next year. Yes. No, Nate, I think you're exactly right. That's a big part of the tool set as you start to reduce a lot of the complexity of the product portfolio. We get a lot more efficiency through just faster-moving inventory. Obviously, you reduced the complexity of a tremendous amount of long-tail customers and your DSO improves from that perspective. So, I totally agree, we'll see some benefits. The team does a phenomenal job right now with our overall cash conversion. But I think 80/20 will be able to take it to the next level. But I think that will be on the back end of the P&L benefits that we get. So, probably looking at as you get through the implementation, we said, hey, 12 to 18 months to realize the P&L benefits, it's probably in that 18 to 24 months. That's the second phase of simplification on the back end. Thanks, Nate. Hey, good morning, Joe. Yes, I mean, we think it could be around 100 basis points in the back-half, sequential decrease from where we finished the first-half."

            "name": "Matthew Pine",
            "content": "Thanks, Andrea. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us today. It's a pleasure to report the achievements of the Xylem team in the second quarter. As you've seen in this morning's release, the team delivered another very strong quarter, outperforming expectations on all metrics. With high single-digit organic growth reflecting gains in both volume and price, the team also expanded adjusted EBITDA margin 170 basis points. And with that outperformance, we delivered adjusted EPS growth of 11%. The story of the second quarter is similar to Q1. On the demand side, our largest markets continue to be resilient. Internally, our outperformance is driven by increasingly disciplined operational execution by the team. This kind of performance momentum is only possible when the whole team is engaged in line to make a difference. And I want to say a big thank you to the whole Xylem team for the dedication and drive they've demonstrated through the first-half of the year. While there were a lot of highlights across the team, I particularly want to mention the standout performance in Measurement & Control Solutions. MCS segment revenue was up 26%, and EBITDA margins are up 700 basis points versus this time last year. The team is doing an outstanding job. Our first-half performance is a reflection of the value creation direction we set early in the year and discussed at Xylem's Investor Day, in May. That direction includes both resilient above-market growth and accelerated margin expansion. It's gratifying to see the kind of momentum reflected in our quarterly performance. In addition, our simplification initiatives in our work on 80/20 are progressing well, and are set to pay off beginning in 2025. Turning to the integration of Evoqua, in late May, we passed the one-year anniversary of our combination with Evoqua. The combination continues to reveal its value. Cost synergies are well on track, and the team is looking to accelerate our pace wherever possible. And our commercial teams are successfully taking Xylem's combined capabilities to the many customers who will benefit from our integrated solutions, both in utility and industrial end markets. With Evoqua integration on track, strong momentum from the first-half, resilient demand, and the team's increasing operational commercial discipline, we're raising our full-year guide for both revenue and margin, increasing our EPS guidance $0.06 from the prior midpoint. In a moment I'll provide an update on our high-impact culture and our leadership alignment, and also on our industry-leading 2030 sustainability goals, but first I'm going to turn it over to Bill to double-click on the quarter's results, our financial position and our outlook. Bill? Thanks, Bill. I'd like to mention two events in the quarter that don't show up in the financial results but are fundamental to Xylem's success and impact. First, in June, just a few weeks after our Investor Day, we gathered Xylem's global leadership team in Washington, D.C. This was the first time we had our top 150 executives in one room, spanning legacy Xylem and legacy Evoqua. It was an energizing two days of collaboration focused on the work of leadership alignment and culture. I've spoken before about culture as the fundamental how Xylem -- how we'll deliver stronger execution of our strategy? How we'll realize our aspirations? How we'll create our next chapter of Xylem's impact. You can see in our second quarter results that the team is already working well and winning. What our Leadership Summit reinforced was how much more value creation potential we have ahead of us, with an aligned team and a high-impact culture. It was fantastic to see the team so engaged by the opportunities ahead of us. Last quarter also saw the publication of our annual sustainability report. We're very pleased to be tracking well towards our 2025 goals, but we took the opportunity presented by this year's report to set out our aspirations beyond 2025. We're raising the bar again by setting 2030 sustainability goals in three strategic areas. The first is decarbonization, reducing our own greenhouse gas emissions and enabling our customers to decarbonize. Secondly is water stewardship aimed at reducing water demand, and finally, we'll provide access to water, sanitation, and hygiene for 80 million people. All three strengthen our customer relationships and increase our impact. Before turning to your questions, I have one more special note. This is Andrea van der Berg's last quarterly earnings call at the helm of Investor Relations. We're happy to announce that Andrea's taking on a new role within Xylem, and it's an exciting new opportunity for her. Over the years, so many of you have told me you deeply value Andrea's energy, accessibility, and professionalism, and I've benefited from her insightful counsel and positive encouragement in every circumstance. So, thank you, Andrea. Some of you have already met Keith Muller, who's taking the reins as our investor relations leader. Keith has had great impact as the Head of Finance in Water Solutions and Services segment, having joined us with the Evoqua combination more than a year ago. He brings deep knowledge of the business to his leadership of IR. And I'm confident you'll enjoy getting to know Keith and will find great value in his insights and perspectives. And with that, let's go to your questions. Hey, good morning, Dean. Yes. No, no, happy to give an update. So, again, the teams are progressing well. Like you said, we have three businesses in the thick of implementing the toolset. North American AWS and North American M&CS smart metering businesses, they're a few months ahead of global transport that kicked off in the second quarter. And we actually just had a kickoff for Applied Water, in Europe, that started on their journey last week. AWS and smart metering have gone through their initial quads and quartile analysis. And now they're working through the [need] (ph) of segmenting their businesses, how they want to support their ongoing customer base, and building their [zoom up] (ph) P&Ls really highlighting the appropriate level of resources they need to run those businesses. They've come out with some initial price increases. Again, those benefits take a little while to work their way through the backlog. So, again, no material short-term benefit, but we see a significant pickup at the end of this year, leading into 2025, where we'll see a more material P&L hit or pickup. The teams are focusing on communicating with their customers and how their toolset is going to impact them, really talking to their largest customers on how these changes will benefit them in the long-term, really improving the overall experience with Xylem as we bring new product innovation to them faster, improve our delivery and quality to them, so a lot of excitement around the toolset externally for their customer bases. So, progress continues. I think we're right on schedule. Again, confident in the value 80/20 is going to bring and provide for us over the next several years, really in line with what we highlighted in the additional impact the toolset is going to have in the framework we laid out back in Investor Day. Thanks for your question, Deane. We didn't see this one coming. If you asked us three months ago, this was not on our radar. So, we're reacting to lots of different volatility out in the marketplace. But the Supreme Court striking this down, the Chevron doctrine, it does introduce some uncertainty in some regulations and federal laws, there's the risk of being challenged, much like the EPA's final rule on PFAS, to your point. Additionally beyond that, Deane, there's litigation ongoing already that's challenging EPA's cost estimates used to set the MCL level, the maximum contaminate level, that four parts per trillion, as you're aware. And it's only going to potentially push out what's already a long phasing timeline of three years to test and five years to mitigate PFAS. So, to your point, we think, ultimately, the states are going to fill in the gaps if the national PFAS regulation is reversed. We don't really anticipate that, but if it does you've got about 11 states today that have MCL, the maximum contaminate level for PFAS in drinking water already, even another 12 states that have some kind of PFAS regulation around guidance health or notification levels, things of that nature, and that's over half the U.S. population. So, while it may stumble a little bit out of the gates and there's going to be some challenges, that we're already seeing challenges in litigation, that's why we didn't bake it into our long-term framework. We just think it's too far out. But we stand ready to and well-positioned to partner with utilities, and we have partnered with utilities, as you know, and helping them manage this and other emerging contaminants. So, more to come, but that's kind of what we think. Thank you. Morning. Yes, Mike. No change or expectations for the second-half. Yes, I think it's playing out exactly how we thought when we gave our update last quarter. Yes, with the exception that we had some accelerated performance in M&CS, which drove us to take up our full-year guide, we increased our full-year revenue guidance up to 5% to 6% and some timing of capital projects in WSS that drove better results in the second quarter. Sequentially, Q3 looks a lot like Q2 from a dollars perspective, which is more challenging year-over-year comps really driving the lower implied organic growth rate. So, we're still confident, bullish in most of our end markets. The macro noise that we highlighted is there's things out there, but from our perspective, we don't see material impact or any signaling of expected slowdown for us. M&CS, there's still high demand for our smart metering products and our differentiated AMI network. Orders were down, but again, that's primarily just project timing. There's still a strong funnel of large deals in the U.S. and Europe and we had several wins recently, a really good one that leverages synergy sale with the [Adrica] (ph). So, the team continues to do an excellent job of finding new projects and winning new business. WSS, again, really strong growth, just really the timing of capital projects there, but they still have strong demand across the legacy ISS and the watering business. They had some orders lumpiness. Again, we had a huge build on operate project last quarter. We have a couple more of those in the funnel that could be realized in the orders here over the back-half of the year. So, really nothing there that is any concern, so bullish around kind of their high growth verticals. Water Infrastructure, again, really strong performance on healthy demand, high-single-digit orders with growth across all the regions, treatment was up over 20% with some large project wins. The Transport business is one of our most differentiated business, and continues to perform well. So, our developed markets and pretty much all our applications within WI are doing extremely well. AWS obviously is the one market that remains a little bit challenged. Again, it's our shortest cycle, most cyclical group of businesses. But what we've seen there has been pretty consistent with our expectations, kind of low-single-digit, second-half comps get a little bit easier, so they'll gradually get to a lower organic decline. And then some of the project wins that we highlighted in the prepared remarks, we'll start to get them back on the road to growth in 2025. Yes. I would say backlog is still really strong. It declined slightly organically, that's primarily just us continue to work down the MCS past due backlog. That's a tough one to forecast just because of the lumpiness of some of the large projects within MCS and again just the new business opportunities within WSS on the build on operate. So, I think we'll bleed a little bit here as we progress the year, but still confident in kind of our long-term growth frameworks for the individual segments getting into 2025. So, I would say lumpiness probably gives us a little bit of caution to give you a specific number, but again, robust demand and outlook for most of our end markets. Good question. Again, like you mentioned, Scott, our first priority is to focus on the integration of Evoqua. And I think you can see from the results that we're doing a great job on both the cost synergies, they're tracking well as well as the revenue synergies. We have, Scott, built a lot of muscle on M&A over the past 18 months with the planning of Evoqua, now the passing one year of execution. So, we've started to build that muscle in the organization, which is going to help us going forward. Maybe the other thing I'd just reiterate that I said at Investor Day is that we've also put in place what I would call a strong bottoms up process in our M&A kind of acquisition process to drive more consistent organic growth and deployment. And I think that's going to help us over the cycle. So, obviously, we just laid out the three year framework. It's not going to happen overnight, but I can tell you that we're very active and we have a very strong pipeline that we're managing. And it aligns well to the value mapping that we just finished up. So, again, we're going to continue to run those targets through our decision criteria, that strategic fit, financials has got to make sense. We're not going to do anything silly. And really to your point kind of organizational readiness, I think we're trending well, we've got good momentum and ready to execute our M&A pipeline. Some of it's just timing, but it is an important piece as we outlined at Investor Day to our EPS growth at mid-teens over the cycle. So, we're very active, but some of it's just timing and we're still in early innings. Yes, I think back in Investor Day, we talked about data centers that's starting to ramp up for us, and especially in our applied water business. But I think we're positioned uniquely to, Scott in the fact that we also move water through pumping, we treat it and then we also sense for it. So, as we're winning these kind of data centers, we can offer a more turnkey solution and we're kind of working at bottoms up as well as some of the actual providers that are building the data centers themselves. So, that's started to pick up some momentum. We had a nice win in applied water. We've had a couple actually kind of at the $7 million to $10 million range. And so, that's going well. Also, I'd say on the power transition, we highlighted a big win last quarter with green hydrogen. And so, the water needed for that over a 20 year contract is big. We've got some other ones that have not kind of fit within the quarter that are in the pipeline that we have got a lot of momentum around as well around power and we see more and more consistency in the semiconductor space with microelectronics and the need for clean water. And a lot of these places have water scarcity issues. And so, the water reuse is super important there. So, I would say that, some of these high growth verticals, we're seeing momentum in big projects. And we don't see that slowing, we see it only continuing and it will be a little lumpy within WSS specifically, but we see good momentum and a good pipeline. Thank you. Good morning. Yes. I'd start us out here and then maybe turn it over to Bill. Again, just a reminder, we're still in fairly early innings to mid innings in AMI adoption. So, there's a lot of runway out there. And although it doesn't always show up in orders, we do obviously put some of the orders in backlog and it's or some of the contracts in backlog and how they convert to orders can be a little lumpy. And this is also a reminder that only 20% of that business is kind of big deals, 80% of it is book and ship or what we call flow. But Nate, just looking at the pipeline that I see, we've got a lot of room for continued growth in that business. And we don't see it slowing down. It's just a matter of timing, more than anything. Yes. And I think you had asked a few calls ago about where we are in past due. We expect to be almost complete with the past due backlog by the end of the year and probably wrap that up in Q1 of next year. So, that burn is happening and obviously leading to the increased guide and M&CS revenue at the high teens. Yes, I can start this out. I mean I think that obviously, we did it for a few reasons. One is to increase our synergies because there is a lot of synergies when you now can move water and treat water. And so, now we're able to go in with the turnkey solution. We're already seeing probably that segment be the quickest to drive synergies, some of those we highlighted at the Investor Day. So, also, I'd say just a common tool set. When you think about back office, we had two service companies when we put the two companies together, the legacy vocal business was much more mature, had good processes and tools. And now leveraging that across the entire services business has been a big help. And I think probably the biggest thing is, over time will be our technician utilization, being able to utilize technicians across the entire portfolio. Now everybody is not completely spungable, but say a third to half of your technicians now can flex and do other types of work that they were doing before. And it also gives our Aqua Pros as what we call them, a broader career path. So, I'd say there's different aspects of how we're seeing it play out, but it's the fastest part of our revenue synergy right now, and it's working well. Not really. I mean, data centers that I think as I've mentioned, is not a huge part of our portfolio. It mainly shows up in Applied Water, although we've seen some synergies that we mentioned one of those in China at our Investor Day, but we've seen some other synergies where managing water at a data center as well as doing treatment. But it's not something that's going to be a big swing for us because it's not a large part of our business. But in general, we're seeing high growth verticals like pharma, life sciences, microelectronics, power, continue to be really robust. And look, no matter what regulations are, whatever's happening from that perspective, what's happening around climate and water scarcity is driving a lot of interest. I mean, I get phone calls all the time from leaders and CEOs in different parts of the world that are dealing with some real challenging stuff in terms of being able to keep their operations open, or the quality of their water, because of maybe saltwater intrusion, dealing with a different type of water they're trying to treat. So, we don't see any real slowdown. We're in really strong high growth verticals. And datacenters is one that's not big for us, but we're going to take advantage of it while it's hot. Thank you. Price-cost was positive there. I think the biggest impact, and that's why we highlighted just the acquisition element, second quarter last year, during the short time that APT was part of that segment, it had an unusually high margin. It was in the low 20s versus its normalized rate of the teens. So, that was the biggest difference. That's why we added in the pro forma margin expansion, 40 bps, and it was at 40% performance incremental. So, fundamentally, the profit there is still strong. It's sequentially improved. We expect it to continue to sequentially improve as we progress to the back-half and have year-over-year margin expansion. I would say from a water infrastructure perspective, they do have probably the largest piece of our China exposure. China's been a little bit lumpy for us. It's actually the first-half it's been positive from a revenue perspective. The orders were down, but we see some of the larger projects, especially within treatment, continue to get delayed just as I think China is trying to figure out the overall economic situation and how they're going to fund several things across their investment framework. So, that's probably the one area we are continuing to keep our eye on as things just seem to be perpetually shifting to the right. Yes, I think third quarter is still down, low single digits. Fourth quarter is probably closer to zero. Again, it's relatively in line, I mean, sequentially, the dollar amounts. The decline is largely seen in developed markets and primarily in our commercial and industrial space. Again, from a macro perspective, the institutional ABI has been negative for 16 consecutive months. And we continue to see manufacturing PMI, which are good indicators for us for that business. But I give the teams a lot of credit. Matthew highlighted; they're making their own luck. They're leveraging their differentiated technology to win some of these larger projects to get back on a growth track into next year. Thanks, Andy. Good morning Bryan. .:Bryan Blair: Very encouraging. Thank you again. Thank you. Thank you. We will wrap it there. Thanks for your questions, and thanks for everyone who joined today. As always, we appreciate your interest in Xylem, and all the very best."

Please note, this event is being recorded.  \n I would now like to turn the conference over to Andrea van der Berg, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. \nAndrea van Berg: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Xylem's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. With me today are Chief Executive Officer, Matthew Pine; and Chief Financial Officer, Bill Grogan. They will provide their perspective on Xylem's first quarter 2024 results and discuss the second quarter and full year outlook. \n Following our prepared remarks, we will address questions related to the information covered on the call. I'll ask that you please keep to 1 question and a follow-up and then return to the queue. As a reminder, this call and our webcast are accompanied by a slide presentation available in the Investors section of our website. A replay of today's call will be available until midnight May 9. Additionally, the call will be available for playback via the Investors section of our website under the heading Investor Events.  \n Please turn to Slide 2. We will make some forward-looking statements on today's call, including references to future events or developments that we anticipate will or may occur in the future. These statements are subject to future risks and uncertainties, such as those factors described in Xylem's most recent annual report on Form 10-K and in subsequent reports filed with the SEC. Please note that the company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements publicly to reflect subsequent events or circumstances, and actual events or results could differ materially from those anticipated.  \n Please turn to Slide 3. We have provided you with a summary of our key performance metrics, including both GAAP and non-GAAP metrics with references to prior year segment metrics being made on a comparative basis, reflecting the change in segment as of the beginning of the year. For purposes of today's call, all references will be on an organic and/or adjusted basis, unless otherwise indicated. And non-GAAP financials have been reconciled for you and are included in the Appendix section of the presentation. Now please turn to Slide 4, and I'll turn the call over to our CEO, Matthew Pine. \nMatthew Pine: Thanks, Andrea. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. The Xylem team delivered a very strong first quarter, outperforming expectations on all metrics. The team drove high single-digit organic revenue growth, reflecting a healthy balance of both volume and price. And the team also expanded adjusted EBITDA margin almost 300 basis points. And without outperformance, we delivered EPS growth of 14%. \n The story is pretty straightforward. We have strong commercial and operational momentum with resilient underlying demand in the majority of our segments and end markets. I want to thank all our teams for doing a great job. But I want to highlight 2 teams in particular, Measurement & Control Solutions and Water Solutions and Services. In both segments, focused effort paid off in really outstanding numbers. In MCS, organic revenue grew more than 20% and margins are up over 500 basis points year-over-year. And in its first quarter as a combined segment, WSS stayed focused on serving our customers and delivered both the highest orders growth of all segments and made a significant contribution to Xylem's overall margin mix. \n In addition to operational and commercial performance, the first quarter also reflected continued momentum on integration synergies with Evoqua. We saw a very solid Q1 run rate on cost capture, and we're confident in how we're tracking both on revenue and cost synergies. On the basis of our momentum, the team's disciplined performance and continuing resilient demand, we're raising our full year guidance for both revenue and margin and lifting our EPS guidance $0.08 from the midpoint.  \n As we look forward, operationally, we're focused on maximizing value from every additional incremental volume we deliver. The team's impressive first quarter margin performance reflects our increasing operational discipline. We're driving simplification across our business, doing the few things that matter most even more efficiently.  \n To solve water, we have to simplify water both for our customers and for ourselves. Strategically, our demand outlook continues to be supported by secular trends that are set to continue across economic cycles. As the headlines reflect, we're seeing an increasingly water-challenged world. And just as with energy, the water economy is intertwined with every part of business and life.  \n So as water security becomes pressing, we'll continue to see increasing demand for the solutions that can help make companies and communities more water secure, and Xylem's platform of capabilities is uniquely positioned to meet this demand. We recently announced we'll be hosting our Investor Day on May 30 to take place both virtually and here at our headquarters in Washington. We're looking forward to the opportunity to provide updates on our strategic outlook, long-term growth and financial framework and our 2030 sustainability goals. And with that, I'll hand it over to Bill to cover the quarter's results, our financial position and our outlook in more detail. Bill? \nWilliam Grogan: Thanks, Matthew. Please turn to Slide 5. Q1 was an excellent start to the year, exceeding expectations across revenue, margin and earnings per share.  I want to echo Matthew's thanks to all of our teams for remaining focused and turning in an outstanding quarter. We continue to see resilient demand with our backlog increasing 4% to $5.3 billion. Organic orders grew 3% in the quarter with book-to-bill above 1, supported by strength across developed markets, particularly in WSS.  \n Total revenues grew 40%, and organic revenues rose 7%, exceeding our guidance and a healthy combination of volume and price. Our performance was led by M&CS and WSS and we saw growth in all regions, led by double-digit growth in the U.S. EBITDA margin was 19.2%, up 290 basis points from the prior year, with productivity savings, strong volume, price and mix more than offsetting inflation and investments. This reflects incrementals of 26% on a consolidated basis and 57% on an organic basis.  \n Our EPS in the quarter was $0.90, above the high end of our guide by $0.05, up 14% over the prior year. Our balance sheet remains healthy with ample liquidity to support capital deployment. We started the year with free cash flow conversion of 9%. This represents significant improvement versus typical seasonality of negative Q1 free cash flow conversion. This year, we delivered higher net income, offset slightly by increased CapEx.  \n Please turn to Slide 6. Measurement & Control Solutions had a great quarter and exceeded our expectations. Orders grew 3% on continued smart metering demand. Backlog rose to $2.2 billion, up 6% organically and book-to-bill came in slightly under 1 due to greater backlog conversion. M&CS revenue was up 22%, driven by smart metering demand and backlog execution. We finished the quarter with EBITDA margins of 22.7%, up 550 basis points versus the prior year and up 440 basis points sequentially. Margin expansion was driven by productivity, higher volume and price and favorable mix more than offsetting inflation.  \n In Water Infrastructure, orders grew 6% in the quarter, led by robust transport demand. Revenue exceeded our expectations with total growth of 40% and organic growth of 6%, driven by healthy demand across all regions and applications. EBITDA margin for the segment was up 320 basis points driven by productivity, mix, volume and price offsetting inflation. In Applied Water, although orders declined versus a year ago, book-to-bill was greater than 1, reflective of a few large project wins. Revenues were down 4%, in line with our expectations against strong growth in the first quarter last year, primarily driven by a decline in developed markets.  \n Segment EBITDA margin declined 380 basis points year-over-year, an unfavorable mix, higher inflation and volume declines, partly offset by productivity savings.  \n Wrapping up with water solutions and services. Orders grew 7% organically led by dewatering and 19% on a pro forma basis with book-to-bill well above 1 in the quarter, driven by a large order for a 20-year outsourced water contract, but even excluding that large order, pro forma demand increased. Organic revenue was up 6%, while pro forma revenue increased 9%, with healthy growth across most of the businesses. Adjusted EBITDA margin was strong at 22.3%, driven by favorable mix in volume and price and productivity.  \n The outperformance across WSS is a great reflection of our team staying focused on what matters, serving our customers throughout this integration and resegmentation.  \n Now let's turn to Slide 7 for our updated full year and second quarter guidance. Given our first quarter outperformance and both commercial and operational momentum, we are raising our full year guidance. We are increasing our revenue guide to approximately $8.5 billion. This reflects an additional point of growth versus prior guidance. That will put total revenue growth at 15% to 16% and organic revenue growth at 4% to 6%. We are confident about driving further margin expansion with operational productivity and are raising our EBITDA margin guidance to about 20%. That represents 110 basis points of expansion versus the prior year driven by higher volume, productivity, including cost synergies and price offsetting inflation. Our updated EPS guidance of $4.10 to $4.25 reflects an increase of $0.08 at the midpoint.  \n We continue to expect around $100 million of exit rate cost synergies in 2024. And free cash flow conversion for the year is still expected to be 115% of net income. The full year outlook at the segment levels remain largely unchanged from our comments in February.  \n For the second quarter, we anticipate total revenue growth will be 23% to 25% on a reported basis and 5% to 7% organically. We expect second quarter EBITDA margin to be approximately 20%, up 90 basis points, driven by higher volumes, continued price realization and productivity gains. This yields second quarter EPS of $1 to $1.05.  \n We came into 2024 at a healthy pace, and we've had a strong start to the year, building further momentum. Our diversified portfolio positions us well to address our customers' evolving needs, and we anticipate healthy demand across most end markets and applications. While we are closely monitoring the macro environment, including inflation, higher interest rates for longer, a strengthening dollar and geopolitical uncertainty, our overall outlook for the year remains positive.  \n With that, please turn to Slide 8, and I'll turn the call back over to Matthew for closing comments. \nMatthew Pine: Thanks, Bill. Two things I want to mention before we close. First, it's been such a privilege in my first 100 days as CEO to spend time with so many Xylem colleagues around the world. You can see they're doing fantastic work, and it's evident in today's results. And our integration progress is a great indicator of how smoothly the Xylem and Evoqua teams have come together. As a combined company, there is so much potential for growth and impact, especially as we pivot to even stronger execution of our strategy. \n To achieve our potential, we're being very intentional about the culture we're building. Specifically, we're creating a culture centered on behaviors that drive empowerment, accountability and innovation. We call it our high-impact culture, and it's the heart of our how, how we are creating the next phase of Xylem's growth and impact. Of course, culture change takes time, and it starts with myself and the leadership team. \n So it's incredibly energizing to see the cultural alignment already coming to life in our town halls and business reviews at all levels in the organization. We'll talk a bit more about how we're fostering our high-impact culture when we gather together for Investor Day at the end of May. Lastly, on Investor Day, we'll also be launching our 2023 sustainability report. We're very proud of what we've achieved and even more motivated by the work ahead. In this year's report, we'll be introducing our combined company goals for the first time, setting our ambition for impact through 2030. Given how fundamental sustainability is to Xylem's business model, I invite you to give it as much attention as you give our financial results. And as always, we welcome your feedback. And with that, I'll turn it over to the operator to lead us through Q&A. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. \nDeane Dray: Maybe we can start with the Evoqua integration and just lots of focus here on the potential revenue synergies, the rollout of the European business. Just any color there in terms of what the potential is on some new outsourcing contracts? And then also, can you just -- any color on that large outsourced contract. That would be helpful too. \nMatthew Pine: Yes, I can start us off, Deane. I'll have Bill cover the big win that we had in our newest WSS segment on the long-term build, own, operate contract. But maybe just broadly on Evoqua integration update, it's really hard to believe that we closed about a year ago. We -- just to remind everybody, we closed that in what I call record time, announced in January, closed in May of last year. And I would characterize this as great momentum. Obviously, we've got an Investor Day coming up in about 4 weeks. And we're going to have some real tangible proof points to the progress that the teams are making.  \n Just briefly, cost synergies are tracking well to meet the $100 million run rate that we've talked about in our '24 plan. And Deane, on revenue synergies, we're ramping. That was the last thing that we were able to really focus on. Obviously, on the cost side, you can do a lot of work before the close. You can't gun jump on the revenue synergies before closing. But the teams have really ramped up. And again, we're going to have some nice proof points to share in a few weeks here in D.C., but I don't want to steal the team's thunder there. But great momentum. And you're going to get examples across 3 of our 4 segments of those revenue synergies.  \n And maybe specifically on international expansion to your point. We are making really, I'd say, quicker progress on the capital side of that. But we're starting to build momentum on the services side. We've got 3 or 4 large scale projects that we're working in the Americas that are kind of outside the U.S., and we've got some work that we're starting to investigate in probe in Europe. And so that's always been the longer part of our tail of the synergy. But I just -- I'm really happy with the momentum that the teams are making.  \n Maybe just 1 other comment before I hand it to Bill. You've seen in the quarter 1 results, we have not been slowed by integration. And that's an important point to make. This can be very distracting. And specifically with our WSS segment, where we recently did what I call a reverse integration with dewatering and assessment services, you can just see the outstanding results that the team posted in Q1 and more to come. So Bill, maybe? \nWilliam Grogan: Yes. And Deane, maybe just to that project. I mean, great win by the team. It's a $100-plus million 20-year outsourced water project to support a large hydrogen plant investment with 1 of our key customers. Obviously, there's an upfront revenue recognition over the first 18 months, and it's about 1/3 of it and the balance will be recognized over the next 20 years.  \n So excited about that. Sticky recurring revenue that, that project will provide. The team has got a really strong funnel of large opportunities that continue to work through, and we look to see continued wins as we progress through the year. \nDeane Dray: That's all really good to hear. And just as a second question, and I'm not asking to front run anything about the analyst meeting that's coming up. But just there's an expectation that there's portfolio optimization coming, there's margin improvement that will be targeted. And I would just want to get a sense of -- I know that's going to be very inward looking at the 4 walls of the company. But what about the growth algorithm. Just during this period, are you still focused on M&A? Are you looking at new opportunities? And I just don't want to miss any of that growth upside during this period of kind of portfolio optimization? \nMatthew Pine: No, it's a great question, and you pretty much hit on 3 of my key messages that I'll be taking up in the Investor Day with me. Look, we're extremely focused on executing on the platform that's been built over the past decade, especially over the past year with the acquisition of Evoqua to drive above-market growth. I mean that's our mantra. This is our #1 execution priority in our goal deployment process this year, and it will be in the future years. And it's really obviously bolstered by the Evoqua synergies.  \n Look, Q1 is 1 data point with our new leadership team in place here. But look, we're up 6% in volume and 1% in price. And I think that's a good beginning of what we're building here on the top line, and I'm super proud of our team's top line mindset. It's not a secret. I've been very vocal about our operating leverage and so of our investors, quite frankly. And so we want to make sure that we're driving profitable growth in expanding our margins. And again, Q1 is a good example of that. We're at roughly 60% almost incrementals on a pro forma basis.  \n And the thing Deane, I would leave you with, when we talk about some of the inward focus, it's really about we have to simplify our business to grow our business. And we're doing both. And so that's really the mantra and the focus. And from a capital deployment standpoint, we'll get into more into that here in a few weeks, but we're going to be focused on high-growth markets with accretive margin and we're going to be more consistent in our capital deployment. And we've just wrapped up some value mapping work that's going to inform where those opportunities are. So we look forward, and the team looks forward to sharing that with you and others here in a few weeks. \nOperator: The next question comes from Mike Halloran with Baird. \nMichael Halloran: So a couple here. First, maybe just taking a step back here, you've been [indiscernible] year-to-date 100-plus days, Bill, you've been there, what, 6, 7 months now. What are the initial impressions as far as the momentum you're seeing, how the messaging you 2 are pushing through are starting to sink into the culture, sink in to the people? And what kind of impressions do you have so far? \nMatthew Pine: No, that's a great question. I did mention that in my opening remarks about the first 100 days. We -- not this me, but we as a team feel good about where we are. And we believe we've got -- we had good momentum coming into 2024. We believe now we're continuing to build on that momentum that you've seen in Q1. We're executing on a great platform, which I just teed up with Deane here. I'd say we did not have a cold start, right? We didn't start this January 1 and figure out how to start turning the crank.  \n With [ COO ] last year, having the opportunity to kind of refine the strategic priorities is a part of our strategy session with the Board. And those themes were really around value capture from our Evoqua transaction. Simplification, not only in service of margins, but growth, which I just mentioned to Deane. And we're deploying that more systematically through the business through goal deployment. I'm really proud of what I'm seeing when I'm out and about with the teams, and scaling services. So that, I'm pleased to see the progress there.  \n Obviously, I'm pleased to see the progress on our Evoqua integration, both economically and the results we're seeing. But culturally, the teams are coming together and working fantastically, and we're seeing, obviously, momentum there.  \n I think the last thing that's most important to me is the how because you can have all these objectives and strategies and things you want to go do, but if you don't have the right culture, then it's hard to execute consistently. And so the work we're doing on our high-impact culture, our how, it started last year with our senior leadership team probably about a year ago this time. And we just engaged our top 150 in the organization at the end of last year coming into '24. And we're seeing great alignment. I've spent a lot of time on the road the past 100 days globally. And I'm really pleased about where we are, but it's a long journey. We have a lot of work to do ahead of us. But with that focus and intention, I believe we can achieve great things. So look, I'm happy where we are. We're not satisfied, but I think we're off to a good start. \nMichael Halloran: And then kind of a broad question on underlying dynamics in orders. One, kind of twofold here. One, can you give the pro forma organic overall orders for the company or give some sort of proxy for it? And then second, if I listen to the messaging here, it feels like not a lot has changed in terms of what you're seeing from an end market perspective across the various segments. I'd like to just understand if there are any notable puts and takes that have either inflected more so or less so than you thought in the quarter or from a trend line perspective? \nMatthew Pine: Maybe I'll let Bill open up on your orders question, I'll give us some commentary and color on the markets. \nWilliam Grogan: Yes. So obviously, organic was reported at 3%. The pro forma organic was 7%, so more than 2x that. \nMatthew Pine: Yes. So good momentum on orders in Q1. The book-to-bill was greater than 1 and backlog up 4%. And not a lot has changed. Demand remains healthy, Mike, in the majority of our end markets. And it's supported by a lot of the favorable drivers that we've been talking about around the secular trends. Government funding is trickling in globally across different parts of our coverage still a lot of resiliency in municipalities or utilities, OpEx and CapEx for that matter. I know that there's been questions about with rates, especially in the U.S. and in Europe with that slowdown, we're not seeing any slowdown. And you've seen with our results in the WSS segment this quarter, the durability of that business model. And I'm really proud of the M&CS team with their backlog conversion. We continue to win orders, though, and our orders are up year-over-year, and we've got good momentum there.  \n So I think a lot of what we talked about is said the same. The watch areas continue to be applied water. It largely was what we expected. We got a better second half comp, and we're working on some things in the business that I think we'll continue to improve performance there. Yes, so I think that would be my commentary on where we are right now from a demand point of view. \nOperator: The next question comes from Scott Davis with Melius Research. \nScott Davis: Congrats on the -- getting through the first 100 days and having a good quarter here. Big picture, Matthew, when you see a synergy target after a deal like yours, I have to wonder, is it input or output, meaning are you trying to find $100 million in synergies? Or is it a natural output of the actions that are taken integration-wise, that's a little theoretical, but I guess somewhat kind of the -- the second derivative of the question is, is that if those synergies track above the [ 100 ] , will you likely be more likely to invest that back into the business or show it on the margin line? \nMatthew Pine: Yes. If you're referring to the cost synergies as a part of the Evoqua transaction? \nScott Davis: Yes. \nMatthew Pine: Yes. So look, we did announce $140 million when we did the deal. So it is a little bit more than $100 million. Look, we're running to a target much higher than 140. And we're going to land the plane for sure at 140, and we're going to make sure that we put that upside probably somewhat to the bottom line, but also somewhat investing in growth. It's probably a mixed bag of whatever the overage would be -- would kind of fall half to the bottom line and half the top line growth. It's easy when you do these deals to look at cost synergies and they're on paper and they look like, okay, they're easy to do, they're procurement, back office, they're lift and shift factories. It looks pretty straightforward, but there's a lot of work that goes into this and a lot of tracking. And I'm really impressed, Scott, of the capability that we have built through this transaction. And that's only going to help us as we go forward and deploy more capital in the future.  \n So I think we're tracking well, we're going to deliver above [ 140 ], and we're going to use that to help continue to expand margins, but also to fuel growth in the future. \nScott Davis: That makes sense. And the second question, I'd probably only get an opportunity to ask this once when you get a newer CEO. But when you think about the buckets of where Xylem is historically perhaps over invested or under invested or over loved or under loved, what stands out to you as areas of perhaps improvement that you'd like to see. I mean, you mentioned the cultural changes and some of the operational rigor. But if you could be more specific around -- around maybe some areas where you feel like you guys could use a little bit more love or the [indiscernible]? \nMatthew Pine: Yes. I think you hit the first one. It's culturally, and I think we're making good progress there. But you've heard me talk about simplify water. I think that's what it boils down to. Over the years as we've built this incredible platform, we have had some complexity conspired against us to some extent. And you can see a little bit of that in our margin profile. So it's not that we're going to be like super inwardly focused, but we do have to focus inwards so we can better serve our customers and our colleagues. And that's where we're focused. It's just making it simple to do business internally at Xylem as well as for our customers, so customer-backed mentality. 80/20 is one tool to do that. There's other tools that we're leveraging.  \n But I think putting this finer focus on what I would call the commercial execution of our business, which has probably been the area that we haven't focused enough around customers and product SKUs and things of that nature really just to simplify the business is the mantra, and I think it's going to pay big dividends for us going forward. \nScott Davis: Super helpful. Thank you, Matthew. We'll see you all in a few weeks. \nOperator: The next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. \nAndrew Kaplowitz: Matt, I know you mentioned you continue to watch Applied Water. I think you did say that you won a couple of larger projects there that led to book-to-bill over 1 time. So maybe what does that say about the market? Is it like you thought, better than you thought, worse than you thought? How would you sort of characterize what's going on there? \nMatthew Pine: Yes. I'd say it's largely what we thought. If you look at the prior Q1s, we're up 10% in each 1 of those. So it's a tough compare. But it's our most cyclical segment, we do continue to expect low single-digit decline this year. It's kind of in line with what we planned. We did, to your point, have good Q1 orders performance. There were a few larger projects in that, that are a little bit out in the future. So it's not something that's book and ship. It's more of future projects. But we do continue to see soft markets, especially in Europe and emerging markets is where our orders were down. Obviously, we're watching developed markets as well, but obviously, Europe plays into that. But our really weakness in Q1 was emerging markets and in Europe for Applied Water.  \n The comps continue in Q2 to be difficult, and we're closely monitoring the funnel, and leading indicators on Applied Water. But look, we feel good about the business long term. It's just a little bit of a headwind in the first half. It will resolve itself in the second half. And we've got a lot of initiatives in place to reduce complexity and redeploy that effort in growth, and we feel confident about that going forward. \nAndrew Kaplowitz: Helpful. And then obviously, it was expected, but can you talk a little bit more about how the new EPA rules regarding PFAS affect Xylem. Did they change the time line at all when PFAS may be impactful? Or is it just kind of slow and steady wins the race for how to think about your impact? \nMatthew Pine: Yes, it's the latter. It's slow, steady race. Look, we're glad to see the rule be final. Now we have some clarity on the rules of the road, the time line. Look, I'm really proud of our teams in providing clarity just 24 hours after the final rule on LinkedIn Live that really shows that we're customer-centric, we're focused. We're being a leader in the space to educate our customers. But again, to your point, this is a long journey. It will take time for the impacted utilities to comply. They've had 3 years for testing, 5 for PFAS removal, and that's a little bit longer than we initially anticipated in terms of when they need to be compliant. And we're really well positioned today and ready to partner with utilities on PFAS and other emerging contaminants for that matter.  \n One thing I don't know a lot of people -- if a lot of people know this, we have over 80 PFAS installations that we've done over the years, and we have long-standing relationships and really a differentiated offering through our service capabilities for our customers. And maybe the last thing I'd say also is we do continue to work on destruction technology. Obviously, the capture technologies out there, it's commercially viable, but there's still work to do when you capture the PFAS, how you destroy it. And so we've got a lot of great work going on with our combined company now and our Innovation Labs team to get after that solution. \nOperator: The next question comes from Bryan Blair with Oppenheimer. \nBryan Blair: Great to drill down on M&CS margin performance, kind of eye-catching step up in profitability there. Maybe offer some finer points on the drivers, seem kind of broad-based in terms of productivity, volume price mix in the quarter? And whether there's anything that we should consider one-time-ish that benefited results? And then lastly on that front, is it still the expectation that margin will improve sequentially throughout the year. \nWilliam Grogan: Yes. No, Bryan, I'll take that one. I'd say [indiscernible] team delivered an outstanding quarter. Obviously, EBITDA margin is up 550 basis points with almost 50% incrementals. That team has been on a journey over the last few quarters, dealing with some pretty significant external challenges relative to the supply chain. And then internal challenges to ramp up production levels that they haven't been able to realize historically to deliver for their customers to make up for that past due backlog. They drove significant labor and material productivity to drive efficiencies to increase our output. They went out with incremental pricing, price cost negative for a while. They're back to price material cost positive. It took restructuring actions to address some underperforming parts of the business just to build a stronger financial foundation that they're now leveraging extremely well with this incremental volume.  \n The first quarter was a bit higher than our original expectations as I did see a little bit better mix towards North American water meters. We think that mix holds plus or minus here in the second quarter, but do see some unfavorable mix impacts in the back half as some lower-margin projects, especially in the energy space ship and that mix normalizes a bit. But we're really encouraged with the teams on momentum that they'll exit the year at record margins. They've started their 80/20 initiatives. So they're just in that phase, which I think will produce additional tailwinds as we exit the year. So really happy with their performance. I think it's -- we probably won't see as big of a step up as we progress through the year. It's probably more normalized now. It's just the strength there in the first quarter, but volumes will slightly sequentially increase as we go through the balance of the year. \nBryan Blair: Okay. Very helpful detail and encouraging trends. Matthew, you mentioned that government money is starting to trickle in. And you touched on the outlook for PFAS and your team's positioning there. It would be great to hear just updated perspective on [ IIJA ] related growth opportunities overall. You've been pretty consistent in tempering expectations to date, understandably so, given the phasing of the rollout, but we have seen some acceleration in obligations and outlays, front-end reads are certainly very encouraging. And looking at the categories of funding and ultimate spend, I would have to assume that your team is going to participate in just about everything.  \n So curious how your views are evolving there and how we should think about the forward opportunity? \nMatthew Pine: Yes. I wish I could turn and stick on that hose nozzle and make it go a little faster, but look, it's -- I've been pretty consistent about this, whether it's in the U.S. or other markets, U.K., in Europe, with their funding. It's just going to be a slow drift and it's going to drip in and really help support our market growth over the next 3 to 5 years. And so that's how we continue to look at it. We don't have a big jump in our long-range plan in terms of incentives or subsidies that are coming in. So it's just going to trickle in and be kind of a layer on top of the market growth. And that's how we look at it. \nOperator: The next question comes from Nathan Jones with Stifel. \nNathan Jones: I wanted to pick up on 1 of Bill's comments and something I know I've talked to Matthew about before, which was the anticipation that in the future price will offset inflation. Several years ago, it had been Xylem's target for price plus productivity to offset inflation. So there's a significant change there. So just looking for some color on how you look to go about implementing that and what you think will give to Xylem the entitlement to be, I guess, a little more aggressive with price versus inflation than it has been historically? \nWilliam Grogan: Yes. I think, obviously, price capture has been a focus with rising inflation. We're going to talk more about that at the end of the month, just a new approach to strategic pricing. I mean, I think for us, it's really -- we're looking to offset our material inflation with price and then let productivity handle the balance of indirect and SG&A inflation and fund our investments. I think the teams have got the operational productivity down, and now it's for us just to continue to refine and our process relative to value capture for the products that we offer to our customers.  \n We were price cost positive. We're looking to really manage that spread going forward, and that's really the target of the teams. \nNathan Jones: I guess my follow-up question for Matthew. You talked about government funding kind of trickling in. There's I think, an increased focus in Europe on non-revenue water, big increases in the focus for that in the next [ half ] cycle and parts of Western Europe and Southern Europe after the 2022 drought. Can you talk about if there's any material opportunities from that increased focus on non-revenue water for Xylem's business over the next several years? \nMatthew Pine: Yes, I do. I think first with our Idrica platform is a great entree into that. There's a lot of opportunities to leverage the Idrica platform to help visualize that data through AMI systems. So that's a big focus area that we're working with utilities on across Europe and across the globe, but especially Europe. And you're right, there's a lot of funding in Europe and in the U.K. with the AMP cycle in the U.K. on non-revenue water. And also, there's a lot of focus on analytical instrumentation, especially out in the environment where they're holding polluters liable for contaminated water. So we see a great opportunity on smart metering and analytical instrumentation in that region with an overlay of our Idrica partnership and platform. \nOperator: The next question comes from Joe Giordano with TD Cowen. \nJoseph Giordano: So on PFAS, I know we talked a lot about it, but can you maybe just talk us through exactly where you're exposed on that? And if there's capabilities that you don't currently have maybe like sampling or destruction that you're currently exploring either internally or maybe through acquisition? \nMatthew Pine: Yes. So -- we're -- obviously, we have the technology to capture through our acquisition with Evoqua coming together at Xylem. And we have over 80 PFAS installations to date. Actually, we just had 1 written up in Newsweek, I believe it was Newsweek a month or so ago up in Maine, where we were capturing PFAS from a well that they had dug to serve the increasing population. So we've got proven technology on the capture side. Where the innovation needs to happen and get to commercial liabilities on destruction. And then sensing, we can sense and bring it to a lab and get the sensing part of PFAS, but need to get sensors that can be in real-time flow. So those are the areas on destruction and real-time sensing whether it's innovation needed and our teams are working on that through our innovation labs. And with the 2 teams coming together from a legacy of Xylem and Evoqua, we believe that we can move faster and obviously spend less money getting there. \nJoseph Giordano: And then the last question, I guess, is 1 I never really thought I'd be talking to you guys about, but we're getting questions about Xylem is like a data center play now on the water side. So can you maybe explain the opportunity set in front of you, either on the power side as we have to ramp up generation capabilities to support a huge buildout or we're like in the buildings themselves on the data center side, how that opportunity kind of scales for you? \nMatthew Pine: Yes. I mean, look, on the power side, we're excited. It's one of our high-growth verticals. You heard Bill talk about the big win, $130 million build on operate win in hydrogen. And so we see that energy mix shift driving lots of opportunity for us. Specific to data centers, I do think it is a growth opportunity. We're starting to see it. Actually, one of our examples. I won't steal the thunder here at Investor Day coming up in a few weeks is about the data center, where we have synergy win there. But it's currently a small part of our revenue, probably less than $50 million.  \n Data centers do need a significant amount of water for cooling and many of them are being built in water-stressed areas, putting a lot of pressure on water resources. So we have a lot of solutions to help them from comprehensive treatment solutions to enable reuse. We've got obviously outsourced services for water management to help as well. So we do believe it's going to be an opportunity for us. It's probably not like maybe some of the other coverage that you folks have, but it definitely will be a tailwind. \nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Matthew Pine for any closing remarks. \nMatthew Pine: Well, we'll wrap it up there. Thank you for your questions, and thanks to everyone who joined today. We hope to see many of you either in person or online at Xylem's Investor Day on May 30. And we look forward to sharing further insights into our priorities and strategic direction then. Until then, all the best. \nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "William Grogan",
            "content": "Thanks, Matthew. Please turn to Slide 5. Q1 was an excellent start to the year, exceeding expectations across revenue, margin and earnings per share.  I want to echo Matthew's thanks to all of our teams for remaining focused and turning in an outstanding quarter. We continue to see resilient demand with our backlog increasing 4% to $5.3 billion. Organic orders grew 3% in the quarter with book-to-bill above 1, supported by strength across developed markets, particularly in WSS.  \n Total revenues grew 40%, and organic revenues rose 7%, exceeding our guidance and a healthy combination of volume and price. Our performance was led by M&CS and WSS and we saw growth in all regions, led by double-digit growth in the U.S. EBITDA margin was 19.2%, up 290 basis points from the prior year, with productivity savings, strong volume, price and mix more than offsetting inflation and investments. This reflects incrementals of 26% on a consolidated basis and 57% on an organic basis.  \n Our EPS in the quarter was $0.90, above the high end of our guide by $0.05, up 14% over the prior year. Our balance sheet remains healthy with ample liquidity to support capital deployment. We started the year with free cash flow conversion of 9%. This represents significant improvement versus typical seasonality of negative Q1 free cash flow conversion. This year, we delivered higher net income, offset slightly by increased CapEx.  \n Please turn to Slide 6. Measurement & Control Solutions had a great quarter and exceeded our expectations. Orders grew 3% on continued smart metering demand. Backlog rose to $2.2 billion, up 6% organically and book-to-bill came in slightly under 1 due to greater backlog conversion. M&CS revenue was up 22%, driven by smart metering demand and backlog execution. We finished the quarter with EBITDA margins of 22.7%, up 550 basis points versus the prior year and up 440 basis points sequentially. Margin expansion was driven by productivity, higher volume and price and favorable mix more than offsetting inflation.  \n In Water Infrastructure, orders grew 6% in the quarter, led by robust transport demand. Revenue exceeded our expectations with total growth of 40% and organic growth of 6%, driven by healthy demand across all regions and applications. EBITDA margin for the segment was up 320 basis points driven by productivity, mix, volume and price offsetting inflation. In Applied Water, although orders declined versus a year ago, book-to-bill was greater than 1, reflective of a few large project wins. Revenues were down 4%, in line with our expectations against strong growth in the first quarter last year, primarily driven by a decline in developed markets.  \n Segment EBITDA margin declined 380 basis points year-over-year, an unfavorable mix, higher inflation and volume declines, partly offset by productivity savings.  \n Wrapping up with water solutions and services. Orders grew 7% organically led by dewatering and 19% on a pro forma basis with book-to-bill well above 1 in the quarter, driven by a large order for a 20-year outsourced water contract, but even excluding that large order, pro forma demand increased. Organic revenue was up 6%, while pro forma revenue increased 9%, with healthy growth across most of the businesses. Adjusted EBITDA margin was strong at 22.3%, driven by favorable mix in volume and price and productivity.  \n The outperformance across WSS is a great reflection of our team staying focused on what matters, serving our customers throughout this integration and resegmentation.  \n Now let's turn to Slide 7 for our updated full year and second quarter guidance. Given our first quarter outperformance and both commercial and operational momentum, we are raising our full year guidance. We are increasing our revenue guide to approximately $8.5 billion. This reflects an additional point of growth versus prior guidance. That will put total revenue growth at 15% to 16% and organic revenue growth at 4% to 6%. We are confident about driving further margin expansion with operational productivity and are raising our EBITDA margin guidance to about 20%. That represents 110 basis points of expansion versus the prior year driven by higher volume, productivity, including cost synergies and price offsetting inflation. Our updated EPS guidance of $4.10 to $4.25 reflects an increase of $0.08 at the midpoint.  \n We continue to expect around $100 million of exit rate cost synergies in 2024. And free cash flow conversion for the year is still expected to be 115% of net income. The full year outlook at the segment levels remain largely unchanged from our comments in February.  \n For the second quarter, we anticipate total revenue growth will be 23% to 25% on a reported basis and 5% to 7% organically. We expect second quarter EBITDA margin to be approximately 20%, up 90 basis points, driven by higher volumes, continued price realization and productivity gains. This yields second quarter EPS of $1 to $1.05.  \n We came into 2024 at a healthy pace, and we've had a strong start to the year, building further momentum. Our diversified portfolio positions us well to address our customers' evolving needs, and we anticipate healthy demand across most end markets and applications. While we are closely monitoring the macro environment, including inflation, higher interest rates for longer, a strengthening dollar and geopolitical uncertainty, our overall outlook for the year remains positive.  \n With that, please turn to Slide 8, and I'll turn the call back over to Matthew for closing comments. Yes. And Deane, maybe just to that project. I mean, great win by the team. It's a $100-plus million 20-year outsourced water project to support a large hydrogen plant investment with 1 of our key customers. Obviously, there's an upfront revenue recognition over the first 18 months, and it's about 1/3 of it and the balance will be recognized over the next 20 years.  \n So excited about that. Sticky recurring revenue that, that project will provide. The team has got a really strong funnel of large opportunities that continue to work through, and we look to see continued wins as we progress through the year. Yes. So obviously, organic was reported at 3%. The pro forma organic was 7%, so more than 2x that. Yes. No, Bryan, I'll take that one. I'd say [indiscernible] team delivered an outstanding quarter. Obviously, EBITDA margin is up 550 basis points with almost 50% incrementals. That team has been on a journey over the last few quarters, dealing with some pretty significant external challenges relative to the supply chain. And then internal challenges to ramp up production levels that they haven't been able to realize historically to deliver for their customers to make up for that past due backlog. They drove significant labor and material productivity to drive efficiencies to increase our output. They went out with incremental pricing, price cost negative for a while. They're back to price material cost positive. It took restructuring actions to address some underperforming parts of the business just to build a stronger financial foundation that they're now leveraging extremely well with this incremental volume.  \n The first quarter was a bit higher than our original expectations as I did see a little bit better mix towards North American water meters. We think that mix holds plus or minus here in the second quarter, but do see some unfavorable mix impacts in the back half as some lower-margin projects, especially in the energy space ship and that mix normalizes a bit. But we're really encouraged with the teams on momentum that they'll exit the year at record margins. They've started their 80/20 initiatives. So they're just in that phase, which I think will produce additional tailwinds as we exit the year. So really happy with their performance. I think it's -- we probably won't see as big of a step up as we progress through the year. It's probably more normalized now. It's just the strength there in the first quarter, but volumes will slightly sequentially increase as we go through the balance of the year. Yes. I think, obviously, price capture has been a focus with rising inflation. We're going to talk more about that at the end of the month, just a new approach to strategic pricing. I mean, I think for us, it's really -- we're looking to offset our material inflation with price and then let productivity handle the balance of indirect and SG&A inflation and fund our investments. I think the teams have got the operational productivity down, and now it's for us just to continue to refine and our process relative to value capture for the products that we offer to our customers.  \n We were price cost positive. We're looking to really manage that spread going forward, and that's really the target of the teams."

            "name": "Matthew Pine",
            "content": "Thanks, Andrea. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. The Xylem team delivered a very strong first quarter, outperforming expectations on all metrics. The team drove high single-digit organic revenue growth, reflecting a healthy balance of both volume and price. And the team also expanded adjusted EBITDA margin almost 300 basis points. And without outperformance, we delivered EPS growth of 14%. \n The story is pretty straightforward. We have strong commercial and operational momentum with resilient underlying demand in the majority of our segments and end markets. I want to thank all our teams for doing a great job. But I want to highlight 2 teams in particular, Measurement & Control Solutions and Water Solutions and Services. In both segments, focused effort paid off in really outstanding numbers. In MCS, organic revenue grew more than 20% and margins are up over 500 basis points year-over-year. And in its first quarter as a combined segment, WSS stayed focused on serving our customers and delivered both the highest orders growth of all segments and made a significant contribution to Xylem's overall margin mix. \n In addition to operational and commercial performance, the first quarter also reflected continued momentum on integration synergies with Evoqua. We saw a very solid Q1 run rate on cost capture, and we're confident in how we're tracking both on revenue and cost synergies. On the basis of our momentum, the team's disciplined performance and continuing resilient demand, we're raising our full year guidance for both revenue and margin and lifting our EPS guidance $0.08 from the midpoint.  \n As we look forward, operationally, we're focused on maximizing value from every additional incremental volume we deliver. The team's impressive first quarter margin performance reflects our increasing operational discipline. We're driving simplification across our business, doing the few things that matter most even more efficiently.  \n To solve water, we have to simplify water both for our customers and for ourselves. Strategically, our demand outlook continues to be supported by secular trends that are set to continue across economic cycles. As the headlines reflect, we're seeing an increasingly water-challenged world. And just as with energy, the water economy is intertwined with every part of business and life.  \n So as water security becomes pressing, we'll continue to see increasing demand for the solutions that can help make companies and communities more water secure, and Xylem's platform of capabilities is uniquely positioned to meet this demand. We recently announced we'll be hosting our Investor Day on May 30 to take place both virtually and here at our headquarters in Washington. We're looking forward to the opportunity to provide updates on our strategic outlook, long-term growth and financial framework and our 2030 sustainability goals. And with that, I'll hand it over to Bill to cover the quarter's results, our financial position and our outlook in more detail. Bill? Thanks, Bill. Two things I want to mention before we close. First, it's been such a privilege in my first 100 days as CEO to spend time with so many Xylem colleagues around the world. You can see they're doing fantastic work, and it's evident in today's results. And our integration progress is a great indicator of how smoothly the Xylem and Evoqua teams have come together. As a combined company, there is so much potential for growth and impact, especially as we pivot to even stronger execution of our strategy. \n To achieve our potential, we're being very intentional about the culture we're building. Specifically, we're creating a culture centered on behaviors that drive empowerment, accountability and innovation. We call it our high-impact culture, and it's the heart of our how, how we are creating the next phase of Xylem's growth and impact. Of course, culture change takes time, and it starts with myself and the leadership team. \n So it's incredibly energizing to see the cultural alignment already coming to life in our town halls and business reviews at all levels in the organization. We'll talk a bit more about how we're fostering our high-impact culture when we gather together for Investor Day at the end of May. Lastly, on Investor Day, we'll also be launching our 2023 sustainability report. We're very proud of what we've achieved and even more motivated by the work ahead. In this year's report, we'll be introducing our combined company goals for the first time, setting our ambition for impact through 2030. Given how fundamental sustainability is to Xylem's business model, I invite you to give it as much attention as you give our financial results. And as always, we welcome your feedback. And with that, I'll turn it over to the operator to lead us through Q&A. Yes, I can start us off, Deane. I'll have Bill cover the big win that we had in our newest WSS segment on the long-term build, own, operate contract. But maybe just broadly on Evoqua integration update, it's really hard to believe that we closed about a year ago. We -- just to remind everybody, we closed that in what I call record time, announced in January, closed in May of last year. And I would characterize this as great momentum. Obviously, we've got an Investor Day coming up in about 4 weeks. And we're going to have some real tangible proof points to the progress that the teams are making.  \n Just briefly, cost synergies are tracking well to meet the $100 million run rate that we've talked about in our '24 plan. And Deane, on revenue synergies, we're ramping. That was the last thing that we were able to really focus on. Obviously, on the cost side, you can do a lot of work before the close. You can't gun jump on the revenue synergies before closing. But the teams have really ramped up. And again, we're going to have some nice proof points to share in a few weeks here in D.C., but I don't want to steal the team's thunder there. But great momentum. And you're going to get examples across 3 of our 4 segments of those revenue synergies.  \n And maybe specifically on international expansion to your point. We are making really, I'd say, quicker progress on the capital side of that. But we're starting to build momentum on the services side. We've got 3 or 4 large scale projects that we're working in the Americas that are kind of outside the U.S., and we've got some work that we're starting to investigate in probe in Europe. And so that's always been the longer part of our tail of the synergy. But I just -- I'm really happy with the momentum that the teams are making.  \n Maybe just 1 other comment before I hand it to Bill. You've seen in the quarter 1 results, we have not been slowed by integration. And that's an important point to make. This can be very distracting. And specifically with our WSS segment, where we recently did what I call a reverse integration with dewatering and assessment services, you can just see the outstanding results that the team posted in Q1 and more to come. So Bill, maybe? No, it's a great question, and you pretty much hit on 3 of my key messages that I'll be taking up in the Investor Day with me. Look, we're extremely focused on executing on the platform that's been built over the past decade, especially over the past year with the acquisition of Evoqua to drive above-market growth. I mean that's our mantra. This is our #1 execution priority in our goal deployment process this year, and it will be in the future years. And it's really obviously bolstered by the Evoqua synergies.  \n Look, Q1 is 1 data point with our new leadership team in place here. But look, we're up 6% in volume and 1% in price. And I think that's a good beginning of what we're building here on the top line, and I'm super proud of our team's top line mindset. It's not a secret. I've been very vocal about our operating leverage and so of our investors, quite frankly. And so we want to make sure that we're driving profitable growth in expanding our margins. And again, Q1 is a good example of that. We're at roughly 60% almost incrementals on a pro forma basis.  \n And the thing Deane, I would leave you with, when we talk about some of the inward focus, it's really about we have to simplify our business to grow our business. And we're doing both. And so that's really the mantra and the focus. And from a capital deployment standpoint, we'll get into more into that here in a few weeks, but we're going to be focused on high-growth markets with accretive margin and we're going to be more consistent in our capital deployment. And we've just wrapped up some value mapping work that's going to inform where those opportunities are. So we look forward, and the team looks forward to sharing that with you and others here in a few weeks. No, that's a great question. I did mention that in my opening remarks about the first 100 days. We -- not this me, but we as a team feel good about where we are. And we believe we've got -- we had good momentum coming into 2024. We believe now we're continuing to build on that momentum that you've seen in Q1. We're executing on a great platform, which I just teed up with Deane here. I'd say we did not have a cold start, right? We didn't start this January 1 and figure out how to start turning the crank.  \n With [ COO ] last year, having the opportunity to kind of refine the strategic priorities is a part of our strategy session with the Board. And those themes were really around value capture from our Evoqua transaction. Simplification, not only in service of margins, but growth, which I just mentioned to Deane. And we're deploying that more systematically through the business through goal deployment. I'm really proud of what I'm seeing when I'm out and about with the teams, and scaling services. So that, I'm pleased to see the progress there.  \n Obviously, I'm pleased to see the progress on our Evoqua integration, both economically and the results we're seeing. But culturally, the teams are coming together and working fantastically, and we're seeing, obviously, momentum there.  \n I think the last thing that's most important to me is the how because you can have all these objectives and strategies and things you want to go do, but if you don't have the right culture, then it's hard to execute consistently. And so the work we're doing on our high-impact culture, our how, it started last year with our senior leadership team probably about a year ago this time. And we just engaged our top 150 in the organization at the end of last year coming into '24. And we're seeing great alignment. I've spent a lot of time on the road the past 100 days globally. And I'm really pleased about where we are, but it's a long journey. We have a lot of work to do ahead of us. But with that focus and intention, I believe we can achieve great things. So look, I'm happy where we are. We're not satisfied, but I think we're off to a good start. Maybe I'll let Bill open up on your orders question, I'll give us some commentary and color on the markets. Yes. So good momentum on orders in Q1. The book-to-bill was greater than 1 and backlog up 4%. And not a lot has changed. Demand remains healthy, Mike, in the majority of our end markets. And it's supported by a lot of the favorable drivers that we've been talking about around the secular trends. Government funding is trickling in globally across different parts of our coverage still a lot of resiliency in municipalities or utilities, OpEx and CapEx for that matter. I know that there's been questions about with rates, especially in the U.S. and in Europe with that slowdown, we're not seeing any slowdown. And you've seen with our results in the WSS segment this quarter, the durability of that business model. And I'm really proud of the M&CS team with their backlog conversion. We continue to win orders, though, and our orders are up year-over-year, and we've got good momentum there.  \n So I think a lot of what we talked about is said the same. The watch areas continue to be applied water. It largely was what we expected. We got a better second half comp, and we're working on some things in the business that I think we'll continue to improve performance there. Yes, so I think that would be my commentary on where we are right now from a demand point of view. Yes. If you're referring to the cost synergies as a part of the Evoqua transaction? Yes. So look, we did announce $140 million when we did the deal. So it is a little bit more than $100 million. Look, we're running to a target much higher than 140. And we're going to land the plane for sure at 140, and we're going to make sure that we put that upside probably somewhat to the bottom line, but also somewhat investing in growth. It's probably a mixed bag of whatever the overage would be -- would kind of fall half to the bottom line and half the top line growth. It's easy when you do these deals to look at cost synergies and they're on paper and they look like, okay, they're easy to do, they're procurement, back office, they're lift and shift factories. It looks pretty straightforward, but there's a lot of work that goes into this and a lot of tracking. And I'm really impressed, Scott, of the capability that we have built through this transaction. And that's only going to help us as we go forward and deploy more capital in the future.  \n So I think we're tracking well, we're going to deliver above [ 140 ], and we're going to use that to help continue to expand margins, but also to fuel growth in the future. Yes. I think you hit the first one. It's culturally, and I think we're making good progress there. But you've heard me talk about simplify water. I think that's what it boils down to. Over the years as we've built this incredible platform, we have had some complexity conspired against us to some extent. And you can see a little bit of that in our margin profile. So it's not that we're going to be like super inwardly focused, but we do have to focus inwards so we can better serve our customers and our colleagues. And that's where we're focused. It's just making it simple to do business internally at Xylem as well as for our customers, so customer-backed mentality. 80/20 is one tool to do that. There's other tools that we're leveraging.  \n But I think putting this finer focus on what I would call the commercial execution of our business, which has probably been the area that we haven't focused enough around customers and product SKUs and things of that nature really just to simplify the business is the mantra, and I think it's going to pay big dividends for us going forward. Yes. I'd say it's largely what we thought. If you look at the prior Q1s, we're up 10% in each 1 of those. So it's a tough compare. But it's our most cyclical segment, we do continue to expect low single-digit decline this year. It's kind of in line with what we planned. We did, to your point, have good Q1 orders performance. There were a few larger projects in that, that are a little bit out in the future. So it's not something that's book and ship. It's more of future projects. But we do continue to see soft markets, especially in Europe and emerging markets is where our orders were down. Obviously, we're watching developed markets as well, but obviously, Europe plays into that. But our really weakness in Q1 was emerging markets and in Europe for Applied Water.  \n The comps continue in Q2 to be difficult, and we're closely monitoring the funnel, and leading indicators on Applied Water. But look, we feel good about the business long term. It's just a little bit of a headwind in the first half. It will resolve itself in the second half. And we've got a lot of initiatives in place to reduce complexity and redeploy that effort in growth, and we feel confident about that going forward. Yes, it's the latter. It's slow, steady race. Look, we're glad to see the rule be final. Now we have some clarity on the rules of the road, the time line. Look, I'm really proud of our teams in providing clarity just 24 hours after the final rule on LinkedIn Live that really shows that we're customer-centric, we're focused. We're being a leader in the space to educate our customers. But again, to your point, this is a long journey. It will take time for the impacted utilities to comply. They've had 3 years for testing, 5 for PFAS removal, and that's a little bit longer than we initially anticipated in terms of when they need to be compliant. And we're really well positioned today and ready to partner with utilities on PFAS and other emerging contaminants for that matter.  \n One thing I don't know a lot of people -- if a lot of people know this, we have over 80 PFAS installations that we've done over the years, and we have long-standing relationships and really a differentiated offering through our service capabilities for our customers. And maybe the last thing I'd say also is we do continue to work on destruction technology. Obviously, the capture technologies out there, it's commercially viable, but there's still work to do when you capture the PFAS, how you destroy it. And so we've got a lot of great work going on with our combined company now and our Innovation Labs team to get after that solution. Yes. I wish I could turn and stick on that hose nozzle and make it go a little faster, but look, it's -- I've been pretty consistent about this, whether it's in the U.S. or other markets, U.K., in Europe, with their funding. It's just going to be a slow drift and it's going to drip in and really help support our market growth over the next 3 to 5 years. And so that's how we continue to look at it. We don't have a big jump in our long-range plan in terms of incentives or subsidies that are coming in. So it's just going to trickle in and be kind of a layer on top of the market growth. And that's how we look at it. Yes, I do. I think first with our Idrica platform is a great entree into that. There's a lot of opportunities to leverage the Idrica platform to help visualize that data through AMI systems. So that's a big focus area that we're working with utilities on across Europe and across the globe, but especially Europe. And you're right, there's a lot of funding in Europe and in the U.K. with the AMP cycle in the U.K. on non-revenue water. And also, there's a lot of focus on analytical instrumentation, especially out in the environment where they're holding polluters liable for contaminated water. So we see a great opportunity on smart metering and analytical instrumentation in that region with an overlay of our Idrica partnership and platform. Yes. So -- we're -- obviously, we have the technology to capture through our acquisition with Evoqua coming together at Xylem. And we have over 80 PFAS installations to date. Actually, we just had 1 written up in Newsweek, I believe it was Newsweek a month or so ago up in Maine, where we were capturing PFAS from a well that they had dug to serve the increasing population. So we've got proven technology on the capture side. Where the innovation needs to happen and get to commercial liabilities on destruction. And then sensing, we can sense and bring it to a lab and get the sensing part of PFAS, but need to get sensors that can be in real-time flow. So those are the areas on destruction and real-time sensing whether it's innovation needed and our teams are working on that through our innovation labs. And with the 2 teams coming together from a legacy of Xylem and Evoqua, we believe that we can move faster and obviously spend less money getting there. Yes. I mean, look, on the power side, we're excited. It's one of our high-growth verticals. You heard Bill talk about the big win, $130 million build on operate win in hydrogen. And so we see that energy mix shift driving lots of opportunity for us. Specific to data centers, I do think it is a growth opportunity. We're starting to see it. Actually, one of our examples. I won't steal the thunder here at Investor Day coming up in a few weeks is about the data center, where we have synergy win there. But it's currently a small part of our revenue, probably less than $50 million.  \n Data centers do need a significant amount of water for cooling and many of them are being built in water-stressed areas, putting a lot of pressure on water resources. So we have a lot of solutions to help them from comprehensive treatment solutions to enable reuse. We've got obviously outsourced services for water management to help as well. So we do believe it's going to be an opportunity for us. It's probably not like maybe some of the other coverage that you folks have, but it definitely will be a tailwind. Well, we'll wrap it up there. Thank you for your questions, and thanks to everyone who joined today. We hope to see many of you either in person or online at Xylem's Investor Day on May 30. And we look forward to sharing further insights into our priorities and strategic direction then. Until then, all the best."
